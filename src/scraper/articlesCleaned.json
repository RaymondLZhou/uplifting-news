        "text": "people from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus a report by public health england says it shows age remains the biggest risk factor while being male is another the impact of covid 19 is also disproportionate for other asian caribbean and black ethnicities but it remains unclear why a trade union for doctors said the report was a missed opportunity for action to be taken to protect health workers who are from ethnic minorities the health secretary said the troubling report was timely because right across the world people are angry about racial injustice on monday night the department of health and social care denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of african american george floyd health secretary matt hancock told the house of commons the public was understandably angry about injustices and that he felt a deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation black lives matter as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account and action is taken to level up the health outcomes of people across this country he said speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing in downing street mr hancock said much more work needed to be done to understand whats driving these disparities we are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing this gap he said adding that he has asked equalities minister kemi badenoch to continue working on the issue alongside public health england phe the bbcs rianna croxford pressed mr hancock on whether there were any specific recommendations for people from ethnic minority backgrounds he said everyone in the different high risk categories highlighted in the report should follow social distancing guidelines very stringently prof john newton said although the virus was having a worse impact on black and minority ethnic people that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity and could instead be related to their job for example he said the reports findings needed to be widely discussed before deciding exactly what needs to be done the report if nothing else emphasises the complexity of what were seeing so really were urging people not to jump to conclusions and institute measures which are not really justified by the data he added london mayor sadiq khan said lives depend on finding out why the virus disproportionately impacts black and minority ethnic people and what actions the government was taking to stop it davida wilkins a 38 year old district nurse in the west midlands told the bbc she felt even more anxious about doing her job following the reports publication she said she felt obligated to continue her front line role but added she cannot minimise the risks posed to her by the virus because its the colour that i am and i cant change it the rapid review was launched when it became clear that some people were getting more sick with coronavirus than others phe reviewed thousands of existing health records and other virus data to look at disparities by it is not possible to combine all of these factors together to judge an individuals risk because of the way the source data is recorded but the data does reveal clear inequalities the analysis on ethnicity and risk did not consider a persons occupation or obesity even though both are known risk factors for getting seriously ill with coronavirus the report also found the government had been under pressure to publish the findings of this inquiry it was due to be released by the end of may now its here its not clear why there was a delay the main findings reinforce what we already know   that belonging to an ethnic minority group is a major risk factor it doesnt move us forward in answering why though the report acknowledges an important flaw in the analysis   it couldnt factor in important risks such as a persons job and underlying health conditions that increase the chance of dying with coronavirus where you live and how much you earn are important considerations too death rates for people living in the most deprived areas of england were more than double the least deprived areas the report says coronavirus has replicated and in some cases increased existing health inequalities it doesnt mention how to address those to save more lives it acknowledges that more work is needed to understand and advise people about the risks labour leader sir keir starmer criticised the report for not providing recommendations for at risk groups adding that the virus thrives on inequality and inequality thrives on inaction labour mp for battersea marsha de cordova said the report was notably silent on how risks amplified by racial and health inequalities could be reduced she said the government must act immediately to mitigate the risks so that no more lives are lost while labour mp for tottenham david lammy said families are living in fear and the government must take urgent action to protect at risk groups gill walton chief executive of the royal college of midwives said while the reports conclusions were helpful it does nothing to protect people she said clear guidance and support from the government should be given to help the nhs tackle the risk to workers the royal college of nursing pointed out that health care staff from black and ethnic minority groups faced an increased risk from the virus and that swift and comprehensive action was needed to protect workers while the council chair of the bma the doctors trade union said the report was a missed opportunity the bma and the wider community were hoping for a clear action plan to tackle the issues not a re iteration of what we already know we need practical guidance dr chaand nagpaul said the equality watchdog says the government should produce a comprehensive race equality strategy in response to the report rebecca hilsenrath chief executive of the equality and human rights commission said people are more than statistics and we cannot afford to ignore the broader context of entrenched race inequality across all areas of life only a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues latest government figures show 39369 people with coronavirus have died in the uk across all settings with an increase of 324 deaths on mondays figures there were 1613 new positive cases recorded in the past

        "text": "this week amid the coronavirus pandemic the bbc has recorded its first programme with a live audience listening from home could this be the new normal for radio comedy shows can you give us a cheer so we know youre there thats great now can you laugh as if i just said something really hilarious its monday evening and radio 4 producer sasha feachem is warming up the audience ahead of a recording of science comedy show the infinite monkey cage but we the audience are not in the bbcs radio theatre as we normally would be instead weve tuned in over zoom to hear a new episode of the programme being recorded virtually for the next hour or so its our job to react to whatever the panellists are saying   starting with a quick sound check that sees us clapping cheering and fake laughing behaving as if youre a member of a big crowd when youre sitting at home feels strange but theres no doubt it adds something weve all been missing from comedy programmes recently   namely atmosphere that was wonderful presenter robin ince says as the programme gets going the idea that there are loads of people sitting alone in their house just applauding and everyone in their street is going oh my god is it 8pm on thursday already the infinite monkey cage is the perfect show on which to test out a virtual audience you can imagine the shows dedicated fans being delighted to take part in a recording which is itself an experiment furthermore it wont be a major disaster if it doesnt work because monkey cage is a science programme and not exclusively a comedy show there isnt the constant reliance on laughter there would be on the now show dead ringers or just a minute ince and co host brian cox tell the at home audience the episode will combine space genetics and archaeology with guests including comedian sara pascoe biological anthropologist alice roberts and archaeologist sarah parcak and with that were off the panellists rattle through topics including ancient egypt undiscovered civilisations in africa and how much neanderthal dna is present in humans today all the guests appear on screen as part of a group zoom meeting   with the audience represented appropriately by an image of an empty auditorium but in every other way its just like a normal episode of the infinite monkey cage as audience members we can hear each others reactions to what the panel says which itself encourages us to laugh or clap more we cant see each other so its not clear how many of us there are but even a crowd with fewer than 100 people in it is enough to add some much needed pace and momentum theres only one technical hitch in the whole recording which comes just as parcak is discussing early erotic poetry one of my favourite things to do if im teaching an archaeology class around valentines day is to read ancient egyptian love poetry   and it will turn your ears purple she laughs its incredibly erotic they were extraordinarily expressive of love they talk about having their hearts broken cheating husbands the same stuff we read today   its glorious at this point producer sasha has to interrupt the recording briefly to fix a technical problem with one of the microphones isnt that typical jokes ince just as we get to the filth typical bbc isnt it fortunately things get back on track and parcak picks up with a tale of some of the earliest recorded pornography you can hear the audience laughing heartily as she describes egyptian papyrus that featured drawings of dancing lions or cats playing games on one side and erotic drawings on the other thats essentially the internet now   its half porn and half cats playing the piano jokes pascoe prompting much laughter from the virtual crowd this recording is the first proper attempt by the bbc to recreate what live comedy used to be like before the coronavirus pandemic some comedy programmes have struggled to maintain their usual momentum recently including have i got news for you and the graham norton show while the quality of the writing and the interviews on these recent episodes may be as strong as ever the jokes still fall flat when met with the sound of silence and so depending on what the finished product is like once its edited monkey cage could provide a blueprint of how comedy shows will sound for the next few months or more the episode we attend on monday which will be released as a podcast next week lasts a little over an hour and will be chopped down to about 30 minutes its hard to predict how it will sound on air during the recording the noise of other audience members is relatively quiet in the mix so as not to drown out the panellists but when everything is mixed for broadcast and the audience can be heard at normal volume its likely the presence of a crowd will make a significant difference theres no doubt that the programme is better funnier and livelier with a virtual audience its not perfect and certainly not as good as the real thing but until some kind of normality can resume it works perfectly well for now as ince puts it what a strange beautiful thing it is were alone but were together follow us on facebook or on twitter

        "text": "zohra khaku is on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus but rather than working on a ward or delivering food she and her staff are on the end of a phone line she runs the muslim youth helpline which offers counselling for young muslims in the uk shes one of many people in this country dealing with the overwhelming effect the virus has had on black and asian communities in a report released on tuesday public health england phe acknowledged the disproportionate effect the pandemic has had on black asian and minority ethnic bame people including making us more likely to become critically ill and to die black people are almost four times more likely to die of covid 19 according to the office of national statistics while asians are up to twice as likely to die over the past few months outreach workers like zohra have been helping those affected by covid 19 in our communities the effects have been brutal   not just physical but psychological societal and financial and they hint at why our communities were so vulnerable to the pandemic in the first place zohra says theyve had a more than 300% increase in calls web chats and emails from distressed teens and young adults since the virus arrived in the uk   including a spike on eid weekend the virus she tells me has led to many young people becoming isolated   including those whod never had mental health issues before   while others are struggling with bereavement and grief after suddenly losing parents and other loved ones weve been going for 19 years but weve never been as busy as this she says the helpline has had calls from young muslims with mental health conditions for whom friday prayers was their only lifeline to the outside world providing them with a vital support system and connection to their community peoples support systems were taken away she says because weve had ramadan in lockdown and people not able to go to friday prayers people who had depression or were isolated or lonely before all of this happened   whose only thing they would do with other human beings was once a week on a friday   they suddenly dont have that any more either please enable javascript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   here are only some of those who have died to see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours one call that sticks in her mind was from a 17 year old girl whose parents had both been taken to hospital with covid 19 because her parents were in hospital she was looking after a 19 year old sibling who was self isolating and a younger sibling who was severely disabled zohra says issue one was i dont have any money left please can you point me in the direction of a food bank because i need to be making food for my siblings the second thing was that she was doing her a levels and applying for university and this was at a time when we werent sure what was happening with grades she said that if one teacher in particular ends up giving her a predicted grade instead of her doing an exam then she doesnt think shes going to get into the university she wants because she doesnt think her teacher believes in her and is a little bit racist so shes worried about her future and the third thing was the doctor from the ward that her mums in called her just before she called us and said we dont think your mums going to make it this girl said to us the next phone call im expecting is to say that shes died how do i make sure she has a muslim burial im only 17 i dont know how to do that thats just one case and yet its so complex she was on nobodys radar and if she hadnt reached out for help shed still be in that situation on her own the outbreaks impact on ethnic minorities mental health has been devastating the muslim youth helpline zohra says has seen a worrying increase in calls from people saying theyre considering suicide we usually get one call about suicide every two weeks but we get them every night now zohra says we had one day last week where half of our enquiries were about suicide and there have been about three or four every night this week the phe report reveals that people living in the most deprived areas of the country are twice as likely as those living in the least deprived areas to be diagnosed with and to die of covid 19 people of black asian and mixed ethnicities are all significantly more likely to live in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods according to government statistics overcrowded households are linked to this deprivation too overcrowding is significantly more prevalent in lower income households than in wealthier ones   according to one study it affects 7% of the poorest fifth of households as opposed to 05% of those in the richest fifth this poses additional challenges for ursala khan who provides counselling specifically to bame youths through her work at the what centre in dudley since the coronavirus outbreak began privacy has become a huge issue she says many of the teens she works with live with large families in small spaces meaning they dont have enough privacy to talk on the phone or video call about mental health although we do offer alternatives like online counselling or phone counselling there are still concerns for people trying to access those ursala says if someone lives in an over crowded house its quite difficult for them to know if theyll have the privacy to speak to us about their mental health according to the english housing survey carried out between 2014 and 2017 30% of bangladeshi households 16% of pakistani households and 12% of black households experienced overcrowding this was compared with just 2% of white british households south asian families in the uk are also more likely than white families to live in multi generational households with up to three generations of the same family living together this means that school age children may be living with their grandparents   something outreach workers have said most iterations of the governments guidance havent taken into account because of this many of the teens the what centre works with are scared of going back to school i see a lot of young people concerned about returning to school or college especially if they live with elderly family members or family members who have pre existing health conditions ursala says some people have been told to go into work when they havent felt comfortable too zohra gives the example of a young man who called the helpline after losing his job after refusing to go into an office he deemed unsafe we had a few cases of people saying im not sure if its safe to go to work but my employers making me and even before the lockdown we had calls about things like ppe she says early on in the outbreak there was one guy who said he got fired for refusing to go in\u2026 but he wrote in a few weeks later and told us you know what i have no job but at least im alive   and i believe that if id continued going into work i wouldnt be the risk is partly because of the kind of work that many black and asian people in the uk do south asians are significantly more likely to work in the nhs for example in england nearly 21% of nhs staff are from ethnic minority backgrounds but they only make up about 14% of the general population at the same time black and asian people are also more likely to be in insecure work   such as gig economy jobs bogus self employment and zero hours contracts   than white people with the same qualifications many of these jobs such as delivery drivers taxi drivers and supermarket work are now considered essential research from the trade union congress tuc last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work a report released last month by carnegie uk trust ucl and operation black vote also found that bame millennials in particular were 47% more likely to be on notoriously unstable zero hours contracts because of this black and asian people are disproportionately more likely to have been key workers in front line jobs during this pandemic   whether thats caring for patients on a covid ward or delivering takeaways rajesh jayaseelan for example was an uber driver in london who died of coronavirus in april days before he died he was evicted from his home and forced to sleep in his car because his landlord had deemed him high risk on account of his job healthcare workers have also highlighted racism and workplace discrimination as major issues during the pandemic last month birmingham community healthcare nhs trusts head of equality carol cooper told the nursing times that black and asian nurses felt they were being targeted for work on covid wards   more so than their white colleagues they feel that there is a bias she told the publication the same bias that existed before they are feeling is now influencing their being appointed   and they are terrified everybody is terrified in another survey last month carried out by itv news about 50% of doctors and healthcare staff who responded explicitly blamed systemic discrimination at work for the disproportionate number of deaths among bame nhs staff one in five healthcare workers said they had personally experienced racism   in response nhs england said protecting staff was its top priority and that it had asked trusts to risk assess bame workers so for now its impossible to pin down whether the higher death rate among bame people is down to sociology or biology michael hamilton from ubele a social enterprise working with britains african diaspora tells me according to phe this is complex   but in essence its both socio economic inequality means were more likely to catch the virus while our biology means were more likely to die ubele has set up a fund to help people hold memorial services for their loved ones after the crisis it is also leading the call for a full independent non governmental inquiry into the deaths of black and ethnic minority people of coronavirus so what in michaels opinion is causing us to die at higher rates than our white british counterparts clearly there are multiple reasons and i think i am personally genuinely in a place to say at this point that i dont know michael says   adding that jumping to conclusions without all of the information is the worst thing we can do i think people are going to find different answers depending on their own speciality he says we might find that there is some biology the socio economic stuff thats my bread and butter so i can recite that but i want to keep looking because i genuinely dont know   but i believe that we do have to know dr enam haque is a gp in manchester but he also works with two bame outreach groups   one that aims to educate patients and another that works with bame healthcare workers he says he and his bame colleagues have been terrified of the virus its quite scary as a gp from a bangladeshi background myself when ive seen bame colleagues dying disproportionately he tells me the virus is very close to home for him   his uncle dr moyeen uddin was a cardiologist in the city of sylhet in bangladesh and was the first doctor in his country to die of covid 19 its affecting his patients too many of our patients are staying away and not contacting us with health issues my fear is that a lot of chronic conditions lots of worrying conditions are not being diagnosed because people are scared   particularly ive observed from the ethnic minority population   that any kind of access to healthcare will make them exposed to covid 19 scientists have been looking into whether certain pre existing medical conditions could be playing a part black and south asian people are significantly more likely than white people to have type 2 diabetes and hypertension that is high blood pressure two conditions known to be high risk the phe report reveals that the proportion of both black and asian people whove died of covid 19 with diabetes was higher than white patients as well as these two conditions a recent study from anglia ruskin university in cambridge has found a link between lower levels of vitamin d and higher covid 19 mortality rates in 20 european countries vitamin d deficiency is particularly common among black and asian people in the uk and other countries with limited sunshine i ask dr haque what in his opinion could be the reason were so much more likely to become critically ill or even die he tells me that although there are medical reasons for people from bame backgrounds to be more vulnerable biology doesnt explain everything its a fact that people from bame backgrounds particularly from south asia are more likely to have diabetes heart disease and high blood pressure all of which make them more at risk he says but the bigger issue in my opinion are the social determinants of health by this he means the economic and social conditions that make some people more vulnerable to health conditions   in this case to becoming critically ill from a deadly virus   than others theres something that has disadvantaged our population and has put us at risk dr haque continues its the inequality in society   theres so much more deprivation people in our communities earn lower wages and we have more people working in frontline jobs as well as well as healthcare workers we have a lot of bus drivers taxi drivers\u2026 they may not have access to ppe in these jobs either so theyre putting themselves at risk while serving the community thats a major factor right there the problem michael hamilton from ubele says is the people were relying on the most in this pandemic are the ones who are the most exposed   and yet by virtue of being considered low skilled they are rendered invisible i think one of the things we have to do   the biggest lesson i think we have to take from this   is to look at what we value and who we value and how we show them value michael says its our ability to not value certain types of people that has allowed this to happen"

online have repeated allegations about mr soros paying agitators mr soros whose open society foundations provide financial support to a number of civil society groups and progressive projects around

not pay people to protest claims have circulated online about russias involvement in the protests viral tweets with thousands of shares suggest that russia was involved in george floyds death   as

        "text": "as protests spread across the us president trump has threatened to send in the army to end the unrest mr trump said he would send in the military if cities and states failed to solve the problem but some state governors have said the government does not have the power to send in federal troops without the permission of the state authorities in short yes under certain circumstances there are already thousands of troops deployed from the national guard which is the reserve force for the us army theyre in more than 20 states across the us trying to quell protests but these forces have been requested by the cities or states themselves however a us law passed in the 19th century lays out circumstances when the government in washington dc can intervene without state authorisation the insurrection act says the approval of governors isnt required when the president determines the situation in a state makes it impossible to enforce us laws or when citizens rights are threatened the law was passed in 1807 to allow the president to call out a militia to protect against hostile incursions of the indians   and it was subsequently extended to allow for the use of the us military in domestic disturbances and to protect civil rights another law passed in 1878 requires congressional authorisation for domestic military use but a legal expert told the bbc that the insurrection act was sufficient legal authority on its own for the president to deploy the army it is widely accepted that the president would have legal grounds to employ the military without asking for approval from the states in the current circumstances the key point says robert chesney a university of texas law professor is that it is the presidents determination to make the governors do not have to request his help according to the congressional research service the insurrection act has been used dozens of times in the past although not for almost three decades it was last invoked in 1992 by former us president george hw bush during race riots in los angeles the law was used throughout the 1950s and 60s during the civil rights era by three different presidents including when there were objections from state governors president dwight eisenhower faced objections when he used the law in 1957 to send us troops to arkansas to control a protest at a school where black and white children were being taught together since the end of the 1960s the use of the law has been rare congress amended it in 2006 following hurricane katrina in an attempt to make military assistance more effective but the amendment was repealed after state governors objected to it read more from reality check send us your questions follow us on twitter"

        "text": "as the uk stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early march the biggest fear was that hospitals would be swamped and incapacitated by a tsunami of patients it happened in wuhan and northern italy the nhs largely pulled through but there were still times hospitals became overwhelmed one of those was when a london hospital became suddenly engulfed with victims on 19 march night shift staff at northwick park hospital in north west london awoke to discover their workplace was so overwhelmed with covid patients that a critical incident had been declared i saw it on the news and thought oh my goodness said consultant tariq husain id had messages from colleagues during the day saying it was getting really busy we needed extra help weve got such a volume of patients it was that realisation that everything we feared was becoming reality it was shocking and almost unbelievable that it was happening six weeks earlier at the end of january brexit was the only story in town coronavirus was still a mystery disease silently circulating in china northwick park which specialises in tropical diseases was soon asked by public health england to start screening people coming into the uk from wuhan who were showing signs of coronavirus the hospitals location makes it easy to access from heathrow airport   similar protocols were used during the ebola outbreak five years earlier by mid february the extent of the global spread of coronavirus was impossible to ignore in italy the number of cases crept up slowly at first and then rapidly accelerated   a textbook epidemic curve northwick park staff were watching the news from abroad closely i love italy and go to italy several times a year   i had actually cancelled a holiday that we had booked for the end of march head of facilities yvonne smith said so taking a particular interest in that and seeing the pictures of the intensive care units there was quite sobering and you knew you were going to have to prepare yourself for something like that yvonne from kent looks after non clinical roles within the hospital   security cleaning porters patient transport and laundry workers all fall under her remit its been extremely challenging because it has been so new and you dont know what to expect it was a challenge managing all those groups of staff i look after in terms of making them safe at work but making them feel confident in the job roles that they had battle plans were drawn up in case northwick park experienced a similar onslaught to the one in northern italy a pod was placed outside the hospital and any patients showing symptoms of coronavirus were assessed there a specialist from the infectious disease department would don full ppe and come to test them inside the hospital training exercises and preparations were just as rigorous some day to day tasks had to be scaled back we mapped out a patient coming in as a live scenario and how we would have to adapt a&e nurse consultant john ross said then we just trained and trained and trained for a good 10 or 12 days so everything we did had to change because of the threat coming in with covid john from inverness explained that initial precautions against the virus were focused on identifying those patients who had travelled from china iran or italy for us it was changing every single day which part of the world they were from and how much risk they had i think italy was when we really had to focus and get even more prepared   we kept saying in our training sessions that it was not likely to happen but lets get prepared john knew that if a coronavirus wave was destined for the capital the boroughs served by northwick park   harrow brent and ealing   would be likely to be hit hard we saw what happened in italy john recalled we know there is a very dense population here we know the demographics we know a lot of our patients have cardiac and respiratory problems   a lot of diabetes   so it was always at the back of our minds you hope that it isnt going to happen but you have to be prepared for it all of their intense training was about be put to the test on 3 march wash your hands was the mantra at the downing street briefing   although prime minister boris johnson explained he had been continuing to shake peoples hands it was on this day the government published a detailed coronavirus action plan ten miles from downing street a patient turned up at northwick park who had just returned to london from iran we knew covid was coming said dr rachel tennent who specialises in respiratory medicine it had been in the news since january and we were preparing around february then it hit us like a tonne of bricks it hit us hard and fast   the epicentre of the outbreak in the uk when a further two patients tested positive for coronavirus the hospital triggered a set of rapid changes surgeons were obliged to give up space so patients could be assessed safely and the a&e department was divided up i remember meeting up here on sunday 8 march   how we are going to keep staff and patients safe rachel said we decided to create different pathways negative going to one area of the department and people with respiratory problems who might be positive to the other we had to move a lot of wards and staff around   stuff that would usually take six months to a year happened in a week the number of seriously ill patients being admitted to northwick park was increasing and within days staff found themselves dealing with a crisis we had an exponential increase rachel said on monday 9 march we opened our respiratory assessment area wards and within two days those wards were full then on the third day another ward was opened and then we started cohorting patients with respiratory problems in side rooms by the end of that second week we were up to a full ward and then another one full coronavirus was declared a global epidemic by the world health organisation on 11 march the virus was by now spreading across london and public health englands modelling suggested cases were doubling in the capital every five days at northwick park they were seeing the number of cases double every two days it increased at a very very rapid rate rachel explained adding that new advice from china was that early intubation of patients was the way forward risks are attached to every intubation as the procedure projects the virus into the air further exposing staff at this point 44 year old consultant tariq hussain had a tough conversation with his family after he was asked to take a senior role in northwick parks critical care response to covid 19 it wasnt an easy call to make you end up sacrificing a lot of things tariq said although he knew that taking on the role was the right thing to do the gravity of the situation was by this stage clear with confirmed infections in harrow brent and nearby ealing jumping from five to 112 in a week we saw all kinds of patients   patients who have been admitted to icu have been relatively fit and well with a few diabetes high blood pressure cases but otherwise reasonably well tariq said but certainly not just elderly we had people in their 20s 30s and upwards from there there have been relatively few caucasians and a high proportion of asian patients which is the cohort of people around here everyone had read the newspapers and seen the news about the scale of the pandemic particularly in china we never thought wed quite reach the point of such a huge volume of patients requiring admission to intensive care patients would initially go into side rooms head of facilities yvonne smith said every time a covid patient vacated that room it would need a full clean so our normal terminal cleans will average 20 or 25 a day at our absolute peak that went up to 96 terminal cleans a day tariq described the surge of patients at this stage as a tidal wave it was about to crash down as northwick park ran out of space for the sick on 19 march the prime minister said it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide against coronavirus at the same time an executive meeting was being held at northwick park where a critical incident was declared we had a lot of patients and more coming in than we could match the demand of what we could actually do head of nursing trish mukherjee said as part of the critical incident protocol patients were shuttled to other hospitals to alleviate the pressure the whole point about the critical incident is for that help within the area dr rachel tennent said you dont want people dying in a busy hospital when 30 miles up the road no one has even got it so the whole point is to share the access to ventilators northwick park became the first uk hospital during the pandemic to declare such an incident   only watford general has taken the same action although weston general also saw its resources pushed to the very limit medical director dr martin kuper was one of those involved in the decision to declare an emergency at northwick park i think it was right for us to do so he said we had an awful lot of patients and we needed some help here to stem the flow of coronavirus cases the uk was put into lockdown on 23 march restaurants pubs and tourist hotspots emptied while hospital beds and morgues continued to fill at the peak of the crisis at northwick park 126 patients in the hospitals nhs trust area died with coronavirus in one week   every one of them with no family present yes the deaths were going up head of nursing trish mukherjee said but the most difficult part was that relatives werent there and we had to stay with the patients and hold their hand and be there for their last moments   i think that was difficult in itself emma leahy a nurse from limerick has the task of using a tablet computer to connect patients with loved ones at home we continue to care throughout all different parts of their stays in intensive care she said seeing a patient who we have cared for a month to be able to wake up and say thank you for looking after me and seeing their children say cant wait to see you dad   this is why we do this job one of the people emma has nursed is jal makai a father of four from northolt who was taken to northwick park on 3 april after collapsing on the toilet in hospital his condition worsened and within three days of being admitted he was hooked up to a ventilator he spent a month on it his kidneys failed and he was unable to walk or hear out of one ear but jal has survived without these guys at the nhs id be gone very simple he said at one point my wife thought that was it i was gone he added when you do open your eyes there is someone here always   maybe even more than one they are angels they put themselves in harms way   they should be getting paid more than footballers if it wasnt for them i wouldnt see my kids again very simple at about the same time jal was admitted nhs veteran of 35 years chris bown took over as ceo of the london north west university healthcare nhs trust which is responsible for northwick park the striking thing for me is having finished a job in the nhs as a ceo in mid january was that the nhs that i left in mid january was not the nhs i returned to at the end of march he said it fundamentally had to shift and change to meet this devastating pandemic i was really quite shocked to see the impact this was having but equally reassured that despite the enormous pressures the staff here in this trust were absolutely doing their utmost to manage very difficult circumstances with great compassion every survival story during the pandemic has provided a much needed morale boost for staff   and they have even had one of their own nurse alicia borja spent a month in the hospital with coronavirus and was eventually applauded out of northwick park by the colleagues who helped save her alicia is recovering at home but will be back to help care for others with the virus that almost killed her weve had 900 discharges of covid patients and that is amazing trish said it was lovely to see alicia recover so well and to see her go home i got to look after her i got to speak with her hold her hand and talk about normal things seeing her be applauded out was just an overwhelming joy there is now relative calm at northwick park covid patients are still coming in but at nowhere near the volume experienced a few weeks ago on the coronavirus ward emma leahy takes a break from chatting with patients and families to reflect the last few weeks have been emotional she said it has been a rollercoaster and its made me realise we take things for granted   and its something i wont be doing any more our work is being recognised emma added i never really knew my neighbours they didnt really know me they didnt know i was a nurse and the last few weeks ive gotten to see my neighbours and weve clapped for carers every thursday together and it has just brought this sense of community and the feeling that we are all in this together north west london is where the wave crashed in covid and we were the hardest hit first medical director martin kupar said the reasons for that our boroughs brent ealing and harrow have a high rate of covid we dont know why that is   it is certainly a diverse and multi ethnic area and then there is a lot of travel as well there are also socio economic reasons he said that patients numbers did not double again at northwick park after the critical incident was declared more than two months on staff now fear a second wave we were the place that was hit first but it would have carried on   the lockdown was essential nothing else can help you reduce the numbers he said it seems likely that there will be upstrokes of waves as the lockdown is eased the rate of increase is likely to be slower than the first time round which is when there were no restrictions on people i dont think weve had a similar crisis in my lifetime in the nhs and i think the staff have been amazing end of youtube post  by bbc london many staff are being encouraged to take time off of course we are on standby in case anything increases ceo chris bown said but we are seeing that the numbers of admissions and deaths through covid 19 have decreased substantially clearly we are all learning a great deal from this and we always need to be prepared if there is going to be a second wave   which we really hope there isnt   but we are now making sure staff take as much annual leave and training as we are in a bit of a dip right now its now almost three months since the first confirmed coronavirus patient was admitted to the hospital even though the past few weeks have been traumatic there is a sense of triumph in the unity compassion and resilience shown by staff at northwick park"

        "text": "when travel start up pana held a meeting for all of its employees over zoom they explained that some staff would be laid off and that there would be two further calls that morning   one at 0900 for those who would be laid off and one at 0945 for those who would not employees would know which meeting they were attending by the invites they would have received by email sales executive ruthie townsend was invited to join the 0900 call but due to the shock of the news she could not remember which call was for those about to be laid off and which was for those being retained because it was such a highly stressful situation it was hard to process what was going on so i got mixed up i joined the 0900 call as that was the invite i had and once i realised that i was being laid off i quickly turned off my video she says ms townsend was on the call with 15 of her colleagues and executives from the company then walked these employees through the benefits the severance package and the next steps the company based in denver colorado had been hit by the collapse in travel due to the coronavirus outbreak but there had been a feeling that redundancies would be a last resort and ms townsend had no idea what was coming that morning that kind of shock is unfortunately commonplace at the moment as companies are slashing staff numbers to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus before the crisis managers would usually have met staff face to face to give them the bad news now video conferencing tools such as zoom and microsoft teams ms teams are being used to replicate the formality of the meeting chris malone an audio visual technician at events company sparq in the uk feared for his role when it was explained to him that a hr representative would be on his next ms teams call along with his line manager his instincts proved correct as he was told he was going to be laid off for him the use of a video call made the meeting formal but more awkward than an in person meeting or telephone call i think if you were doing it over the phone it would mean you dont have to look at someone but when you have the video call you get dressed up to make it feel formal and to look presentable even though it is a video call the pressure is there   and as youre not in the room with them there isnt a natural chemistry connection or body language you can read off and theres a little bit of a delay youre waiting for someone else to say something he says however mr malone believes that a one to one video call is still the best way a business can break the unfortunate news to an employee in the current circumstances for ms townsend there were pros and cons to having more than 15 people on the same call as her i dont think any way of making someone redundant over video conference is going to be ideal if its one on one its still going to be really hard and then your boss is going to see all of your emotions i liked the group setting because i turned off my video and i didnt have to say anything she says however she believes that the group setting prevented her from asking important questions at the time more technology of business sarah evans partner at law firm jmw explains that communication prior to any announcement is key for employers what many big businesses can do is conduct large meetings on zoom to make an announcement to the same people at the same time so theres no miscommunication going around she says this would make it clear that redundancies or the furlough scheme are being considered for employees and would also make clear what this means for the business and how they intend to follow up with individuals it is key for employers to provide employees with time to absorb the information ask questions and give people the opportunity to voluntarily be made redundant or furloughed in redundancy cases that would be at least a couple of meetings to go through opportunities to avoid redundancy and consider alternatives and theres no reason why all of this cant be done on zoom she says the use of video phone call or in person is not a legal matter its merely a matter of etiquette however the group call which ruthie townsend had experienced in the us would not be allowed in the uk that wouldnt cut it in uk law as you have a right to individual consultation theres nothing wrong with a group call to announce potential redundancies but you shouldnt be making people redundant in the same video call ms evans says if this were the way a uk employer had acted the employee might then have a case for unfair dismissal the option to record video calls could also prove problematic in these cases peter binning a partner at law firm corker binning explains that generally speaking anyone should ask for consent before recording a call of any kind however regardless of whether consent was asked for given or not given a recorded conversation could still be admissible in an unfair dismissal case whoever wants to use the evidence has to be able to prove that it had been properly recorded and was genuine but it would be a matter for the court or tribunal to decide whether that evidence should be admitted mr binning says and those wanting to snoop on people by deliberately joining a zoom call where someone else is being made redundant would most definitely be breaking the law   as there are a number of criminal offences about intercepting communications in the regulations while video may create new problems it is the best replacement for a meeting in person it will feel more uncomfortable to look someone in the eye and the level of emotional frustration and anger will be more visible but it is essential to delivering the message in an open fair and transparent way to another person says stuart duff an expert on the psychology of leadership at business psychology consultancy pearn kandola"

lines to a standstill schools businesses restaurants shops and churches have either reopened or are about to   with strict social distancing measures theres even the promise of summer holidays elsewhere in europe but britta whos just finished her workout is unsure about easing restrictions im torn she said i enjoy the new freedoms but at the same time im rather scared maybe it was too early i think people need to be careful still and mustnt be careless germanys calm and successful handling of the pandemic attracted international attention but its next moves have been chaotic characterised by squabbling between regional leaders which has culminated in a faster lifting of restrictions than chancellor angela merkel would have liked the leaders of germanys 16 states have the power to decide how and when they do that unable to agree a common strategy theyve instituted a patchwork of rules and regulations with people in one state able to for example use the gym again while in another region fitness centres have remained closed its fuelled an intense public debate about the lockerung or relaxation policy with many fearing that germany could squander its initial success its too soon were easing up too fast and too much and we risk a second wave said professor frank montgomery who chairs the world medical association professor montgomery speaks for many when he says

population but many suspect theres another reason for that so called beauty contest angela merkel is due to stand down next year after four terms in office the race to succeed her was well under way but the coronavirus crisis has transformed political and public life and with it the chances of those with ambitions to the chancellery some like the businessman friedrich merz have all but disappeared from the spotlight while others like the countrys health minister jens spahn or bavarias premier markus s\u00f6der   who grabbed headlines by announcing the first lockdown in his state   are being talked about as possible chancellors in waiting armin laschet whose office overlooks the d\u00fcsseldorf waterfront has been one of the most voluble agitators for a swift relaxation of coronavirus restrictions the premier of north rhine westphalia   and one of the leading chancellor candidates   denies that his approach has anything to do with trying to maintain a high profile through the crisis the measures we had to decide now are so important   a matter of life and death   you couldnt act on a tactical basis he said among the population it was much more popular to close everything down but i thought that was wrong\u2026i acted out of a basic sense of responsibility to this state hes a cheerful chap who enthusiastically jabs a finger at official charts showing the downward trend in infection rates mr laschet says its best that every region with their differing economies geographies and infections should act independently we have the health problem of the pandemic the infection disease but there are other damages he said for children from disadvantaged backgrounds if they cant go to school for 10 weeks they lose chances sick people who didnt have covid 19 didnt get treatment because the hospitals were reserved for covid 19 people in care homes got lonely lost the will to live these are damages too and they claimed lives its why i always thought you have to consider both sides of the story not just the virological one he said not far away in a tent outside a care home i sit opposite katharina resch a perspex screen divides us but it means we can talk safely face to face the relaxation has meant her family has now been able to visit the pensioner but the staff worry theyve kept the virus out but fear the impact of a second lockdown on their residents if general infection levels rise katharinas concerned likening the rush to lift restrictions to upending a sack of potatoes im sceptical that this head over heels approach is a good thing he said but i think politicians are so under pressure that they have to do something a care worker wheels katharine back into the home and she waves goodbye germany may have got its outbreak under control for now but scientists and politicians are watching anxiously it is as angela merkel has repeatedly acknowledged a fragile success"

        "text": "early in the covid 19 outbreak the shetland islands were one of the worst hit areas of the uk by head of population now no new cases have been detected there for six weeks some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown   but for the first family on the islands to test positive it hasnt been easy it was a clear bright tuesday in early march when the plane began its descent the shetland archipelago stretched out ahead of the tiny twin propeller aircraft iain malcolmson looked through his passenger seat window at the sprawl of islands aware of how far north hed just travelled iain 53 an architect was on his way home he and his wife suzanne had spent a long weekend in the italian city of naples with four friends theyd hesitated before setting off on 28 february   news bulletins were full of alarming footage of the covid 19 cluster in lombardy 500 miles to the north of where they were staying but official travel advice at that point was clear   it was safe to visit the south of the country   so theyd gone as planned all the same iain recalled spending the trip fastidiously wiping down restaurant tables and washing his hands now after an overnight stop in edinburgh iain would soon be back at the house in the tiny settlement of nesting about 12 miles north of the islands capital lerwick locals call this leg of the journey the white knuckle express in strong winds the plane has to take off and land at sumburgh airport sideways like a crab normally iain preferred the 14 hour overnight ferry from aberdeen but on this occasion everything seemed calm during the first week of march 2020 the novel coronavirus pandemic that had raged out of wuhan still seemed far away here in the tiny aeroplane scotlands mainland was 110 miles to the south norway was 190 miles to the east it was still possible to conceive that shetland might be spared you have to understand what shetland is like says iain were pretty isolated and i think most people thought it would be something that would happen to other people it wouldnt have come to shetland then two days after he landed on the evening of thursday 5 march iain noticed he had a headache from sumburgh head in the south to out stack the northernmost point in the british isles shetland has 567 sq miles of land and 1679 miles of coastline of its 100 odd islands 16 are inhabited and about half the 23000 population like iain and his family live close to lerwick in the summer days are up to 19 hours long in the winter if youre lucky you can see the northern lights the islands were pledged to scotland by norway in 1468 and the norn language   a form of old norse spoken on the islands   died out in the mid 19th century the scandinavian influence is still strong from the nordic derived placenames   burravoe grutness mavis grind   to the brightly coloured timber clad houses dotted across the landscape and the annual up helly aa fire festivals which conclude with the torching of a viking galley but despite this shetlanders dont want the rest of scotland to forget about them a 2018 law introduced by the islands member of the scottish parliament banned public bodies from producing maps that depict shetland for reasons of cartographical convenience in a box in the moray firth or east of orkney rather than its true geographical location iain was raised as a shetlander he left to study architecture in edinburgh where he met suzanne but two decades later after starting a family they decided to open a practice back on shetland it had been their dream for a long time its just the freedom that you have he says youve got family friends and that sort of thing its a very friendly positive sort of place hes a well known figure in shetland   he sits on the local community council is a keen up helly aa participant and has played guitar in local bands the property he and suzanne designed for their family to the dimensions of a norse longhouse was featured on the bbcs scotlands home of the year programme shetland might be remote but it is no backwater thanks in part to the discovery of north sea oil in the late 20th century its per capita gdp is among the highest of all scotlands local authority areas in the 1970s the local council drove an extraordinarily hard bargain with the energy companies who wanted to operate the terminal at sullum voe compensation payments were invested in a charitable trust that ensures the islands have exceptionally good public services the facilities up here are second to none says iain every little community has its own leisure centre or pool when he woke on the morning of friday 6 march iain still didnt feel well for the past two days hed gone in to work but now he clearly wasnt up to it one of the friends hed travelled to naples with a glasgow resident wasnt feeling great either and had been advised by the nhs to get tested so iain and suzanne arranged to be tested too nurses arrived at the couples house they stripped off on the porch and before stepping inside changed into full ppe   visors protective suits   before taking swabs from the malcomsons noses and the backs of their throats it was like something off the telly iain says the whole scenario was unnerving but the staff were reassuring they were saying youll be fine the chances of you having it where youve been are almost zero so dont worry about it he says he and suzanne stayed indoors that weekend anyway there was a delay while the samples were tested   iain was told they had to be flown down to aberdeen and then taken to glasgow on sunday evening the results came through shetland had its first confirmed cases of covid 19 everybody was gobsmacked says iain and it all kicked off from there at least one person on shetland wasnt surprised by the arrival of the virus his name is michael dickson not long before as nhs shetlands chief executive hed been summoned to the mainland for a presentation on the likely impact of the pandemic i can honestly say when i came out of the government briefing it was without a doubt the worst day of my entire career he says to go back to shetland and have to share that with the people of shetland was incredibly difficult he also knew that shetlands geographical isolation would make treating the virus there especially challenging lovely as it is he says lerwicks gilbert bain hospital was never built for this there is no intensive care unit anywhere on the islands at that stage any patients who became critically unwell would need to be flown to aberdeen or elsewhere on the mainland in an enormous raf atlas military transport aircraft but shetland would have advantages too standing at his front door i can cast my eye out and see no one he says theres houses but im not going to see anyone walking down the street if i go for a five mile run i might run into three or four people its just a completely different place to socially distance also an outbreak of measles on the aberdeen ferry meant nhs shetland had very recent experience of carrying out contact tracing that was hugely useful he says the fact is knowing the geography of shetland the different communities makes a huge difference this was crucial dickson says after the first positive test results came in when that call went out from the public health teams to say we need to do this now there wasnt a debate people came in on their sundays and said right lets start lets get on with this the nurses in visors and ppe suits who came to test the malcolmsons took the names of everyone they had come in contact with and tested them too according to dr susan laidlaw nhs shetlands public health consultant staff from other nhs departments were drafted in to phone contacts we had a week of very long hours and intense work following up the contacts identifying new cases and getting them tested and isolated she says although difficult at the time this did help to contain the initial outbreak everybody at our work got it iain says and everyone from our works family ended up getting it some had diarrhoea others lost all sense of smell and taste others fared worse   iain says the father of one of his employees had to be airlifted to aberdeen he would later make a full recovery while the contact tracers scrambled to identify how far the virus had spread iains condition was getting worse suzannes symptoms were cold like but his were more like the flu   a high temperature shivering there was talk of flying iain too to aberdeen the prospect terrified him i really didnt want to go off the island he says after a few days iains symptoms began to improve but the knowledge he might have given the virus to others in less robust health weighed heavily on him he was terrified hed given it to his parents both in their 80s that stress was there knowing that you could have given it to people who werent going to be as lucky as you and while hed been feeling unwell iain hadnt felt much like looking at social media he hadnt yet seen the rumours about him the virus spread quickly on shetland on 12 march four days after iain and suzannes test results came back the number of confirmed cases announced in the local press rose from two to six five days later they stood at 15 by 19 march they had risen again to 24 these were not enormous numbers but they were enough to ensure that shetland had the highest number of covid 19 patients in scotland relative to its population and one of the highest in the uk i think we were top of the graph possibly in the world at one point says dickson as dickson sees it this early spike was in part testament to the efficiency of the contact tracing teams a dedicated covid ward had already been set aside at the hospital but compared to orkney and the western isles which had largely been unaffected at that point shetland stood out   and shetlanders were understandably anxious dickson believes this was a crucial factor in containing the outbreak it meant islanders were already taking social distancing seriously before controls on movements were enforced its a difficult thing to say but i think having those cases early on enabled us to move possibly more quickly than had we not had cases until later on in the pandemic he says my family live down in brighton and if you went down to the beach there a week before the lockdown occurred you wouldnt have known anything was different in shetland things have been different pretty much from day one as early as 11 and 12 march two up helly aa fire festivals   hugely important events in shetlands social calendar   were called off in response to appeals from the health board the following day while the cheltenham gold cup was going ahead as planned 700 miles away it was announced that nearly all shetlands schools would close from 16 march   a week before the rest of the country cafes bars restaurants and leisure centres were already shutting down across the islands long before the scottish and westminster government imposed their lockdowns says maggie sandison chief executive of the shetland islands council i think theres a really strong sense of community in shetland says sandison naturally islanders were anxious to do the right thing by their neighbours but also because such a high proportion of the population knew each other people were aware that they may have come into contact with somebody who then became a positive case   and this in turn meant they knew to self isolate sandison says the early decision to close schools was taken in part because some teachers had been part of the contact tracing teams and were advised to stay home after coming into face to face contact with people who had tested positive on a sparsely populated group of islands this was enough to put a strain on staffing levels at the same time there was quite heightened anxiety from parents some of whom were keeping their children at home already ferry operators also began preventing tourists and non residents from travelling to the islands before nationwide restrictions were brought in because the transport links with the mainland were reduced early on and the transport operators are only taking people who have essential reasons for travel this has to some extent isolated the islands says laidlaw a weekly covid 19 facebook livestream hosted by dickson would attract as many as 600 viewers at a time and shetlands community spirit wasnt just about locking down and staying vigilant when laundry staff at the hospital found they had a shortage of scrubs a sewing pattern was posted on facebook along with an appeal to turn any unwanted bedsheets into medical clothing we had bags and bags of finished scrubs within days says a personal assistant working for nhs shetland 38 year old lisa grey who oversaw the shetland scrubs project as well as bringing extra colour to the wards superhero patterns on erstwhile childrens duvet covers proved especially popular with medical staff you can see it when youre flicking through facebook   folk saying if anyone needs shopping im off tomorrow if anyone needs help there will always be someone thatll help grey says with the rest of scotland and the uk soon following shetlands example in locking down and many other covid 19 clusters emerging around the uk the islands felt less like an outlier but as march turned to april the archipelagos cases kept rising and before long it would report its first death word had spread quickly around the islands that the malcolmsons had been the first to test positive iain had never expected otherwise one thing about shetland is you have absolutely no anonymity he says people know youre the person thats brought it in to iain it was understandable in a perverse way when rumours about his family began to circulate on social media their names hadnt been officially released and in the absence of fact people just make stuff up he says thats never going to change theres always a few idiots out there as he hadnt been looking at facebook it was news to him when friends got in touch to say the family was getting a serious amount of flak according to the gossip on the weekend he and his wife had been tested we were everywhere   we were out on pub crawls we were out at concerts says iain that weekend we did everything in shetland that everyone else was doing and i dont know why but they were totally convinced that theyd seen us there it was bad enough when it was confined to facebook then tabloid journalists began calling the house iains friends and family were feeling the pressure they urged him to go on facebook and correct the record iain really didnt want to do it he wasnt a big social media person what if it backfired might this not antagonise people further but something needed to be said late one evening iain sat down at his computer and began typing after some of the hardest few days we have ever experienced and it is only getting harder it is with a heavy heart that suzanne and i feel it is necessary to put straight some of the more vicious rumours that are circulating about us on social media in shetland he wrote after being told they were to be tested and advised to self isolate we have not left the house since and have not been out partying or socialising of any kind the response was overwhelmingly positive the post was shared over 1000 times friends and neighbours backed up their account the record was duly corrected iain didnt bear a grudge   this was what happened in the absence of reliable information it showed you the good side and the bad side of social media according to national records of scotland nrs the first death of a person in shetland with covid 19 took place some time between 30 march and 5 april five more came the following week a sixth the week after that on 6 may another death was announced there have been no more since then tragically five of the seven were in a single care home shetland has good reason to hope it has seen its last coronavirus death of the current peak the last time a resident of the islands tested positive was 20 april   since then the total number of confirmed cases has stood still at 54 nine days afterwards dickson told shetlands local media that the outbreak there may have plateaued theyve obviously managed to control the virus by doing an early lockdown says hugh pennington emeritus professor of bacteriology at the university of aberdeen who has advised the scottish and uk governments full marks to them really whatever they did worked shetlands isolation and lack of new cases makes it along with orkney effectively a very small scale new zealand says prof pennington   and like new zealand he says the islands could in theory lift their lockdowns by strictly controlling who comes and goes but the islands authorities are cool on the idea of a new zealand style quarantine dickson notes how many patients have to travel to aberdeen for routine non covid medical treatment so are we saying those people arent able to go to the mainland because weve closed our borders its also necessary for the fishing and oil industries for some people to have the ability to travel in and out its not just winter and spring events like the up helly aa festivals that have been postponed though as a result of the lockdown in 2020 the long summer days will pass on the islands without sheepdog trials the accordion and fiddle festival shetland wool week and theres no end in sight   the first fire festival of 2021 has already been cancelled the absence of tourists is also being keenly felt my business wouldnt exist without tourism says lynn johnson who runs the cake fridge tea room on a single track road between voe and aith on west shetland mainlands northern coast to keep it going she needs both the lockdown to be lifted and travel to resume we really really need that spring summer along with the big tourism boost that our islands get to see us through the winter and were not going to have that at all but for now the lockdown is holding shetland is ready to resume contact tracing   which was halted in late march as in the rest of the uk   and laidlaw says the islands are well prepared for the next phase since late april shetland has had its own covid 19 testing equipment meaning samples no longer have to be sent to the mainland and two small planes   like the one iain flew back from holiday on   have been converted into air ambulances in spite of the apparent success of shetlands track and trace operation no one may ever know how the virus arrived there iain and his wife may have been the first people on shetland to have tested positive but that doesnt mean they were the first to bring it obviously i know about the contact tracing the malcomsons and their experience says dickson we picked up those people who were diagnosed and got a positive result i always say those are the ones we know about shetland is a small community but we do have people who come in and out of the islands frequently the couple most likely travelled in with the virus but what we cant guarantee is they were the only people and there is no guarantee the malcolmsons caught the virus in italy either as it is thought to have been circulating in edinburgh where they changed flights since february"

        "text": "the government has come under pressure from mps and businesses to relax the 2m 6ft rule for social distancing to make it easier for people to return to work but scientists continue to question whether that would be safe given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread the simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected the greater the risk of catching the virus the world health organization says that a distance of 1m is safe some countries have adopted this guidance while others including the uk have gone further timing is also key the longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person the bigger the risk scientists advising the uk government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m being exposed to someone coughing is riskier being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance in a study published in the medical journal the lancet scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread they conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection the risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m but only 3% beyond that distance and the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m the risk is further reduced by half it can be traced back to research in the 1930s scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground most of those droplets they reckoned would land within 1 2m that is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto and then touching your face many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission but some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols if that is the case then the flow of wind from someones breath could carry the virus over longer distances professor lydia bourouiba from the massachusetts institute of technology mit used high speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m and a study carried out at hospitals in china which found traces of coronavirus in covid 19 wards and intensive care units estimated that 4m was a better safe distance but for the us centers for disease control the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is currently uncertain and whats still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious there is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of covid 19 following up the contacts of the people infected they estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside in many countries including england and scotland people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible it is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it but there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions it will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried and how viable it remains which will all take time"

        "text": "lockdown is starting to ease across the uk we can meet more people while in england some children are back in school and car showrooms and open air markets have reopened but some scientists even those advising government have been in mutinous mood   saying ministers are acting too soon and the lifting of restrictions has been described as a dangerous moment even by englands deputy chief medical officer things are far better than when lockdown came in there were an estimated 100000 new infections every day in england on 23 march the day when boris johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives that compares with around 8000 daily infections at the moment its somewhere in the range of 10 fold fewer but thats still considerable dr adam kurcharski from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine told the bbc the speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower the r number   the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto   was around three when lockdown came in that meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others now the r is around 07 09 meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others however a comparison by the university of oxford suggests the uk is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown and it is notable the governments own coronavirus alert system for england remains at level 4 rather than level 3 when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed the chief science adviser sir patrick vallance warns there is not a lot of room for manoeuvre and the data urges caution r is close to one   the tipping point where cases increase again and we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread the restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus but their precise impact is unknown uncertainty is a particular issue with schools the governments evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact there is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick throughout the pandemic the scientists and politicians have been following the same script but there is now a clear loud and public split between some of those advising government and those following the science more than a dozen sage committee members who advise government have spoken out saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down essentially were lifting the lid on a boiling pan and its just going to bubble over argued prof calum semple major deja vu feeling to mid march scientists incredibly concerned politicians ignoring this public doesnt want life disturbed end of twitter post  by @devisridhar there is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now   it may lock us into the current number of cases there are approximately 8000 infections a day if easing restrictions raises the r number close to one then we will continue to have around 8000 infections every day waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a second wave however that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer there is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the uk the aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected the strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus south korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39000 in the uk however there is a danger in expecting identical results the uk is not using gps tracking to ensure people do as they are told like south korea or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in hong kong speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the uk and an analysis of south koreas strategy by imperial college london suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections depending on how optimistic the number crunching the number of people that have been infected remains low so any immunity is also low that means there is the potential for a second wave but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react the plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens with a cautious piecemeal approach i think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high lets not call it a second wave lets call it a second bump said prof mark woolhouse from the university of edinburgh a sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely dr kucharski said i dont think well see a huge exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks it may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters it will be late summer or autumn or even winter depending on what happens it may be

        "text": "lockdown restrictions are gradually being eased across the uk but the rules are different in each of the four nations so what sports can you play and who can you meet the overall advice remains stay at home as much as possible but some non contact outdoor sport is allowed   although rules vary across the uk people in england can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households in scotland people from two households in groups of up to eight people can exercise outside together this means for example that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries as long as people stay 2m 6ft apart and practise good hand hygiene however small sided or full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions individual sports permitted in england if social distancing guidelines are followed include athletics golf horse riding and tennis where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household tennis can also be played in scotland and northern ireland   but not yet in wales however golf can be enjoyed everywhere more than two people can now meet outside across the uk in england groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside in parks or private gardens in scotland two separate households   up to a maximum of eight people   can meet outdoors ideally travelling no more than five miles in wales any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside as in scotland families should aim to travel no more than five miles beauty spots remain closed in northern ireland groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors children are included in the headcount for groups meeting in england scotland and northern ireland in wales two large families can meet   as long as each of them lives at a single address and remember social distancing guidelines   with people from different households remaining 2m 6ft apart from each other   still apply across the whole of the uk socially distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible for many people who want to see their friends and family prime minister boris johnson has warned people in england it remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families other than to access the garden or use the toilet overnight stays are also still not permitted hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority if you use the toilet while visiting another home you should clean any surfaces you have touched prof chris whitty the uk governments chief medical adviser said if you were to do something like a barbecue remember that passing things from one person to another if you havent washed your hands you can pass the virus that way the guidelines in scotland say that for a barbecue each household should bring their own food cutlery and crockery the rules in wales so far say you can eat while out on a walk run or cycle but first minister mark drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an invitation to go into a garden have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people people with certain underlying health conditions or who are pregnant or aged over 70 are deemed to be clinically vulnerable if you are in this category you are advised to stay at home as much as possible and if you do go out take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household there is another group of about 25 million people categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable these include people who have had organ transplants cancer patients and those with severe respiratory conditions this group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face to face contact   so called shielding now people in england and wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines it means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household people living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing despite the easing of lockdown restrictions across the uk scientists stress the need for people from different households to remain 2m 6ft apart social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets   packed with the virus   into the air these can be breathed in or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on and then touch your face with unwashed hands this coronavirus appears to thrive in crowded indoor spaces which is why pubs restaurants and many workplaces remain closed and the public has been advised against using public transport but virus transmission is less likely when fresh air is involved   usually when people are outside if you show symptoms of coronavirus   such as a dry cough high temperature or loss of taste   you must take extra precautions you should stay at home and not leave it for any reason this is known as self isolation you should not leave your property even to buy food or medicine and instead order these online or ask someone to drop them off at your home if the nhs test and trace team in england gets in touch because youve been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you will have to self isolate for up to 14 days   even if you feel fine the people you live with dont have to self isolate but they must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing there are similar tracing systems in scotland wales and northern ireland antibodies test a medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity the test detects antibodies in the blood which are produced by the body to fight off the disease asymptomatic someone who

        "text": "the government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 may its also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed   staff patients or those isolating at home the uk statistics authority chairman has written to the health secretary matt hancock saying the published official figures are far from complete and comprehensible the department of health and social care dhsc said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown and the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease but as the programme has expanded it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data people tested is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test on 22 may when the data for people was last published 140497 tests were carried out on 80297 people the gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result people with void or unclear results were sent a new test up to 19 may 8% of tests carried out at drive through and pop up testing sites were inconclusive the figure for home test kits was not provided there are also good clinical reasons to retest someone   to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms on top of this people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests but not the people tested figures the latest round of office for national statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 april 10 may involved 10705 participants together surveillance swab and antibody testing which are important but arent used to diagnose people individually accounted for almost 30000 of the just under 130000 tests carried out on 30 may all of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result the government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons so we cant tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people like health and care staff and care home residents are being tested regularly the dhsc was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted   as one person tested or many a spokesperson did refer to a small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test suggesting routine testing may be limited an imperial college london study by the same modelling group that has informed much of the governments response said in april that nhs staff should be tested weekly even if they didnt have symptoms this need for routine testing has been echoed by nhs providers the body representing hospital trusts and nadra ahmed chairwoman of the national care association which represents independent care providers said routine testing in care homes was just not happening on 28 april health secretary matt hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didnt have symptoms but ms ahmed described this as smoke and mirrors she said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents and were still waiting 14 days later some hadnt even been able to test their staff and residents once while others were struggling to get onto the portal the uk statistics authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out but not yet returned in the number of tests its chairman sir david norgrove accused the government of using the data to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding although the dhsc reached its target of providing 100000 tests a day by the end of april it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned after setting the 100000 tests a day target the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested in fact when it came to the people tested figures home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab this may account for some of the gap but again we cant say how much this in itself appeared to be a source of confusion   even within the department guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the people tested figure but this note was later taken off the website a dhsc spokesperson said these tests were only counted as people tested at the point of being analysed in the lab and that the note was removed to avoid confusion follow rachel on twitter"

        "text": "the uk is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months under the new rules we asked doctor and tv presenter xand van tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible details of the rules vary across the uk so if you are living outside of england some of the advice below may not apply to you the first thing to do is think about who youre inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them   we are very differently vulnerable to this virus if youre inviting overweight men who are older they face a very different risk to young families with young children if youre inviting people whove had the virus thats very different again think about the invitation and think about who youre putting at risk if youre thinking of inviting a 70 year old overweight man i would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept if youre shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings if you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly brilliant if they cant and people are walking through the house it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask wash their hands when they get into the house and then go straight into the garden they shouldnt touch anything you need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible to maintain social distancing about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six person gathering if everyone is from different households which is massive if you had 12 two metre by two metre picnic blankets you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that youre two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby i dont expect everyones got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that were talking about you need to find some way of measuring you could get a two metre pole a bamboo cane a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with hold it and spin around in a circle   everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other in your garden you could mark two metres out with blankets chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people   no one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench when we talk about gardens i look at mine and its a very small space to have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible in terms of bringing your own cutlery its difficult everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk theyre prepared to accept if you think youve had coronavirus and or youre low risk meaning youre young youre slim youre female   those are the main variables   your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other peoples cutlery but of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill if you are a man whos older and overweight and dont think youve had the virus i would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw if youre in the park you might not be able to wash your hands so i would say bring hand gel wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby if youre having people in your garden you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe you could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off if youre hosting say to everyone were all going to wash our hands once an hour you could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says wash your hands there needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet you should flush with the seat down   a lot of people dont bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids once you flush then you need to wipe down the loo you need either disinfectant wipes in the loo or you need a spray with some disposable towels you also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so youre not re contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom you want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom all the surfaces need to be wiped down even then remember its not a risk free zone probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated   you are definitely taking a risk by doing this youre not allowed to hug people and thats the rule but in my experience if a small child wants a hug its virtually impossible to stop them for people with nieces nephews grandchildren godchildren or other important children in their lives who they havent been able to see for a long time if youre going to a picnic in their garden its going to be quite difficult to avoid contact i would say if you do end up having a hug at least dont grab the person and pull them into your face a proper full frontal hug is the most dangerous but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous the only safe advice though is not to hug you should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering you are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population we still have a high level of transmission in the uk alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when theyre drunk the other thing is the time limit if you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking thats wildly different to coming over and saying were going to sit two metres apart for an hour and well wear a mask on the way in anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer the virus either moves through the air or it moves through droplets coming out of peoples mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets i would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left this virus is unpredictable and dangerous   significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the uk we have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it"

five with symptoms can get tested people working or living in care homes can be tested even if they dont have symptoms during the coronavirus epidemic the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings on sunday matt hancock announced the uk had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200000 a day by the end of may   describing it as an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus but only about 115000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 0900 bst that day   and that figure includes  testing kits posted out to homes the chairman of the uk statistics authority has now criticised the presentation of the daily figures saying they appeared to be aimed at showing the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding sir david norgrove has written to mr hancock saying the information is far from complete presented in a way that is difficult to understand and relevant figures may be misleadingly described he points out some people are tested more than once   either to prove they no longer have covid 19 or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms or because the first test doesnt work sir david is also calling for more detailed data on those being tested he wants age sex location and job to be included   such as working in a care home or hospital the government says it releases full data a spokesman said the government was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to increase transparency around the governments response to coronavirus the test finds out if you currently have the virus it involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat which can be done by the person themselves or by someone else these tests wont show if you have had covid 19 in the past and since recovered antibody tests   which do look for evidence of past exposure   use blood samples from patients the uk now has capacity for 40000 antibody tests a day but these are only being offered to health and care staff testing is essential if the contact tracing systems now in place in all four uk nations are to work effectively help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for uk wide lockdowns tests can also help people including nhs workers know whether they are safe to go to work they can also let the health service plan for extra demand and inform government decisions around social distancing and lockdowns people who test positive for covid 19 will be told to self isolate for 14 days   and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same even if they dont have symptoms close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes read more about contact tracing in england scotland wales and northern ireland there are several options you can travel to a drive through testing site visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered to your door the government says home test kits will be limited at first because of a lack of availability testing at an nhs facility such as a hospital is available for patients and some nhs workers couriers will collect samples and take them to laboratories the government says it aims to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken or within 72 hours for a home test speed is important if the contact tracing systems across the uk are to work well   because delays will give the virus more time to spread speaking the day before englands tracing system was launched prime minister boris johnson said there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours but the department of health and social care said no formal deadline had been set to achieve this on the same day the head of englands test and trace programme dido harding said 84% of tests at drive through centres were returned within 24 hours and 95% within 48 hours she didnt provide a figure for home testing kits or those provided at other settings follow rachel on twitter have you been tested or are you waiting for a test please include a

        "text": "as schools prepare to reopen on monday to children in years one and six some parents social media feeds have turned toxic kirstie brewer talks to mothers feeling judged or shamed for their decision to send children back to school   or to keep them at home marshas whatsapp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children on 1 june there was outrage relief excitement anxiety everyone seemed to have an opinion marsha wrote that shed be happy to send her son back to school then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher whod tested positive for coronavirus this is why i will be keeping rosie safe at home with me   im not putting her life at risk she wrote a few other parents then sent thumbs up and shocked face emojis to show their approval of rosies mums message it felt very passive aggressive says marsha who said she didnt want her real name to be published because she couldnt face more drama the whatsapp group she belongs to is for parents with a child in year one at a school in the bristol area and is normally a source of useful information but since the pandemic hit its become toxic she says people have been posting lots of screengrabs from facebook which are full of misinformation about how the virus spreads and the risks to children she says but if you dare to try to correct anything or put things into perspective you get shot down and it is implied you are a bad parent im trying to hold down a full time job while also homeschooling two children   i find being judged by other parents on top of that very hard to deal with sophia 25 had a similar experience when she commented on a facebook group for single mums that her four year old daughter would be returning to preschool she was branded selfish by another mum   and then she watched as that damning verdict was endorsed by likes from other members of the group normally this would be a very positive empowering community says sophia who works full time as a charity consultant so its a sign of how much times have changed it showed me how much the lockdown is getting to people she says it feels as if the worst assumptions are being made about someones reasons for sending their child back to school or nursery sophias daughter has special educational needs and for weeks now she hasnt had access to her usual speech therapy she learns a lot by being with other children so being at preschool is the next best thing for her she explains i could have a phd in childrens education and it would still be better for her to be around other children there is no substitute for that parents who have decided to keep their children at home havent escaped the crosshairs either harriet shearsmith founder of parenting website toby & roo has an instagram following of 116000 and is one of the few mummy bloggers to have publicly stated her position on this divisive issue she wont be sending her children back when the schools reopen in june but when she explained this decision she was careful to add the caveat that she wasnt criticising other parents if you fall into the group of people who are choosing differently to me or you simply dont have a choice this isnt a judgement of you or a dismissal of your situation she wrote some nonetheless responded witheringly that harriet obviously didnt care much about her childrens education   but as an experienced blogger she is accustomed to dealing with it ive had comments you know youre going to be damaging your children or youre just not very intelligent and a terrible mother that kind of thing is said but i largely just ignore it she says lockdown has made us all much quicker to lose our tempers we are much more frayed and we are all in very stressful positions regardless of what those positions might be fellow blogger alison perry says she has also noticed the ground shifting it feels like all the social rules have changed she says everyone feels very differently about homeschooling and screen time and even just interpreting the government guidelines im usually a very outspoken person but have found myself biting my tongue because whatever i say there will be someone there telling me im wrong or selfish liz who lives near cambridge points to another possible explanation   people now have more time to spend on social media she says so any backlash gets amplified like marsha and sophia she is planning on sending one of her children back to school on monday its really difficult to know what the right decision is but we think that the benefits of our son going back to school outweigh the risk of him becoming ill she says she has been hurt by judgemental comments from other parents on her facebook group some of whom shes known for several years apparently those of us who are willing to send our children back to school when they reopen are sending them back to be guinea pigs or canaries to see if cases are going to rise again she says i said i found it offensive that does imply that anyone who is happy to send their child back to school is throwing them to the wolves so to speak whereas actually we  just want some normality for our children and you know education and socialisation when she made this point in response to a critic on facebook she says she was accused of bullying the issue seems to have caused a deep divide she notes with regret she has now minimised her time on social media and advises other parents in her position to do the same the parents on marshas group who are sending their children to school have taken a different approach   they have started avoiding the main group chat and talking among themselves instead a few parents on mumsnet whove made the decision to send their child back to school say theyve felt bruised by the negative responses of family or friends which seem to be driven by worries about the infection risk many people are highly dubious that the youngest children can really be prevented from sharing bugs and carrying them out into the community and lots of people have picked up on teachers concerns about whether schools have had enough time to prepare a really safe environment it seems likely that peoples responses are driven by understandable fear and uncertainty but if youre a parent run ragged by nine weeks of homeschooling while attempting to hold down a job other peoples judgement is likely to be the last thing you need the first rule of self care is to find time for yourself but how do you do that when you have to juggle work and family duties easy says sue elliott nicholls just steal it how skiving made me a better parent"

        "text": "the government has told schools to reopen for certain year groups from 1 june but what does it mean in practical terms for schools   and how are they getting ready we spoke to one head teacher to find out its like doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are green that is how debbie whiting head teacher of north denes primary school in norfolk describes the task in front of her   remodelling her school during a pandemic so that three classes can return next month the more you look at things the more there is to think about she says classrooms have been stripped out new signage put up around the school and year groups divided into small bubbles to keep pupils away from each other and   it is hoped   minimise the risk of coronavirus spreading the school in great yarmouth already knows it will not be ready to reopen for reception year 1 and year 6 classes on 1 june and is instead working to a deadline of 8 june this summer the school should have been preparing to move into its new \u00a39m buildings but construction delays mean all focus is now on making the existing school safe for returning pupils the 1 june date might be convenient for being after half term but its not given us anything like the time we need to put things in place says mrs whiting its really difficult you just keep thinking have we caught everything parents have been asked whether they will send their children back   but only half have responded making planning difficult so far one third of those who have replied say their children will return mrs whiting estimates she can make her plans work if about 40% of the 180 children return if they all came back she would need an extra 12 classrooms at the school the school hopes to make social distancing as natural as possible for children by breaking classes into smaller bubbles of about seven pupils and two teachers but without knowing the intentions of the other families the plans could be useless mrs whiting has left the decision up to parents but wrote to them recently to warn them school will be a very different place until we have those numbers planning to keep everyone safe in bubbles is really tricky she said my concern is that theyve heard that schools are reopening and on 1 june they just arrive for the rest of term all school life will take place within the bubbles in those groups pupils will learn eat and play with each bubble using a nominated classroom and set of toilets to prevent cross infection children will not be allowed to take bags to school and will work in a new exercise book and their teacher will not take them home to mark uniform policy will be scrapped as children will need to wear clean clothes every day and many will have outgrown it anyway if theyve got different clothes on every day youll know that theyve actually changed said mrs whiting the school has gained experience from teaching the children of key workers over the past weeks and the numbers have steadily risen from eight pupils to 20 parents will expect us to social distance their children and we intend to do that says mrs whiting the school day will be re organised with staggered starts and a lunchtime finish once children have been given their food in the morning children in each bubble will arrive at 15 minute intervals and line up in the playground two metres 6ft 6ins apart before being led into their classrooms only one parent will be allowed to drop off and collect each child with no gathering by the school gates though mrs whiting acknowledges getting several children to school at different times is likely to cause problems in single parent households bubbles will be kept separate at break times and when they are given lunch with each being given their own area of the playground to use even before coronavirus the school was without its kitchen because of building works and could only use half of its main hall pupils movements around the school will be restricted mainly to their bubbles but the way they use the communal areas will change each year will have a separate entrance to the buildings and school corridors will operate a one way system so people can maintain their distance doors will be left propped open and handles cleaned regularly its about controlling all movement says mrs whiting we also started careful hand washing before the lockdown and the children have been pretty good at that hand dryers in the toilets have been switched off on official advice and replaced with paper towels while the school has ordered pedal bins for every classroom so that ppe   which will be used for first aid or personal care   can be disposed of safely and without contact classrooms will also look different with the need for distancing reducing capacity to about eight desks all rooms have now been decluttered and non essential items removed filling the schools storage spaces in the younger age groups classrooms soft furnishings rugs and toys have been removed   anything remaining will have to be washed at the end of each day cleaning routines have been stepped up and surfaces will be disinfected regularly pupils will be asked to bring their own stationery and forbidden from sharing in a letter to parents mrs whiting had previously warned there is no such thing as social distancing in a school   we can try but we certainly cannot guarantee it the logistics of preparing the school come on top of the everyday challenges of leading a school in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country the government line is to get children in school so that they dont fall behind and in disadvantaged areas that is important says mrs whiting but a lot of those who want to return are not those who are in that group the department for education says it wants children back in schools for their education and wellbeing and the phased return is based on scientific and medical advice for head teachers the last few weeks have been wearing says mrs whiting as they juggle pressures from government parents who want their children to be kept at home and those who want them back at school underpinning all the preparations her focus has been on keeping the children as safe as possible this is something ive never ever had to deal with she said and you do wonder what happens if someone gets it and heaven forbid theres a fatality but i cant hold myself responsible for that because im not the one who is asking them to come back the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites"

        "text": "some children in england will be going back to school from monday 1 june following a heated debate the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus adults   and particularly older adults   are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus across the uk 001% of deaths were people under 15 1% were aged 15 44 and about 75% were over 75 half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in england wales and northern ireland were 60 as at 15 may and half were younger according to a research charity but the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40 children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases according to prof adilia warris a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the university of exeter they often have milder disease than adults she says pointing out that deaths have been rare there have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to kawasaki disease and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads it is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is   at any age to understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population and work out how they might have caught it a university college london review of the evidence based on studies using contact tracing and population screening suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus the governments scientific advisory group for emergencies sage said the balance of evidence suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and if they do catch it less likely to pass it on but the evidence remains inconclusive it said one study looking at cases in shenzhen in china at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms but research carried out since then has been more reassuring studies of clusters of infections in family groups across china have concluded   based on contact tracing   that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children a study of a cluster of infections in the french alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms community studies in iceland south korea the netherlands and  italy all found evidence children were less likely to have   or have had   the virus than adults the italian region studied tested 70% of its population a review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded the role of children in transmission is unclear but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection and lower rates of children bringing infections into households one theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells but experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this more children in schools means more teachers working and more parents at the school gates and its not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection as the sage report says it is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff parents and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school the group of scientists modelled nine different return to school scenarios on 16 may deputy chief medical officer for england dr jenny harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the r number   the measure of how fast the disease is spreading   while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school it was reported that in 22 european union countries where schools were partially reopened there hadnt been a significant increase in cases including among staff these countries all opened up schools to different extents france did report a small uptick in cases after partially re opening schools but world health organization who chief scientist dr soumya swaminathan agrees that children are less capable of spreading the virus and are at very low risk of getting ill from the disease what we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools government guidelines say it wants to start with reception year 1 and year 6 children in england because the government says secondary schools in england will be able to reopen to year 10 and year 12 from monday 15 june but only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time the schools minister nick gibbs told mps there is still no decision about the governments ambition to send all primary children in england back before the summer break"

so we hit 25000 tests a day   prime minister boris johnson 18 march outcome on the same day a press release from the department of health and social care dhsc gave more details of the tests to diagnose coronavirus and said the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks but the government did not hit 25000 tests a day by mid april only 18665 tests were conducted in the uk excluding northern ireland on 15 april in terms of testing capacity   the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day   that stood at more than 30000 by mid april i am now setting the goal of 100000 tests per day by the end of this month   health secretary matt hancock 2 april outcome on 1 may the government said it had reached the target and announced 122347 tests for the last day of the month 30 april the testing figure had been averaging about 20000 a day but increased significantly in the last days of april when home testing kits were introduced in large numbers towards the end of the month dhsc began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures so it doesnt mean the test was actually used by someone on that day previously only instances in which the testing swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test the 122347 figure included about 40000 kits sent out to homes and test centres in a letter to mr hancock on 2 june sir david norgrove chair of statistical watchdog the uk statistics authority was critical of this methodology the aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding he wrote prof john newton who leads the governments testing programme said on 1 may thats the way they are counted have always been counted and the way we were advised to count them by officials in may using that methodology the government hit its target 18 times and missed it 13 times the devolved administrations in wales and scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing but waless health minister vaughan gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5000 tests a day by mid april blaming problems obtaining testing kits likewise first minister nicola sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 april that scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10000 tests per day by the end of april saying we are working towards a capacity of 3500 by the end of april the scottish government announced at the beginning of may that it had reached this reduced target the ambition clearly is to get up to 200000 a day by the end of this month and then to go even higher   boris johnson in parliament 6 may there had been some confusion as to whether the target for testing by the end of may was 200000 tests conducted or a capacity to do this many tests matt hancock eventually clarified that it would be the capacity for tests and that it would include antibody tests which establish whether somebody previously had the virus and tests being sent out to a random cross section of society by statisticians as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms on 30 may the dhsc announced that the uk had hit the target with labs able to process 205634 tests a day this included capacity to do 40000 antibody tests a day on 31 may they carried out 23000 antibody tests when it comes to number of people actually tested for coronavirus on a daily basis the government has not released this figure since 22 may the dhsc says the number has been temporarily paused we are working with boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of april   matt hancock statement 4 april outcome dhsc told the bbc on 4 may that 49 regional test centres were operational across the country mr hancock had previously said in a statement that there would be over 50 by the end of april the drive through test centres are run by boots and other commercial providers dhsc also said that 96 mobile testing sites were in service by 4 may by mid may well have an initial 18000 contact tracers in place   matt hancock 1 may outcome on 1 may mr hancock said that the governments testing programme was the first element in the wider strategy to test track and trace he added that an initial 18000 contact tracing staff would be in place by mid may their role is to identify individuals that have covid 19 and then to track and trace anyone theyve recently been in contact with those individuals can then get themselves tested on 18 may mr hancock told parliament that 21000 contact tracers had been recruited in england of whom 7500 were healthcare professionals and on 20 may mr johnson told parliament already we have recruited 24000 trackers   by 1 june we will have 25000 i have great confidence that by 1 june we will have a system that will help us very greatly to defeat this disease on 1 june matt hancock said that the contact tracers had been working since thursday 28 may but would not give figures for how many people they had contacted on the personal protective equipment the answer is by the end of this week   boris johnson 25 march outcome on 25 march mr johnson was asked in parliament when every single person working in care homes around the country would receive the personal protective equipment ppe they needed he said it would happen by the end of that week however that didnt appear to happen in early april nadra ahmed from the national care association said the issue we hear most is i am desperate for masks has anyone got any gloves i am down to my last stock once you run out it is a question of being down to marigolds and bin liners according to those working in the care home sector the situation improved later in april but was not resolved martin green from care england said on 20 april that access to ppe remains problematic and that care homes still need a consistent supply the dhsc says that from 25 february to 27 may over 151 billion items of ppe have been delivered across the health and social care system in england it hasnt given a figure for care homes this includes it has been counting gloves individually so this last figure would be over 451m if counted as pairs concerns about the availability of ppe in care homes have also been raised in scotland and wales making sure that the nhs always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical   matt hancock 17 april outcome the government has met its objective by 18 may the last day the figures were published the proportion of critical care beds occupied by covid 19 patients had fallen to 20% in england 17% in wales 10% in scotland and 15% in northern ireland the spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for the virus the government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment our goal instead of the 30000 is that we need 18000 ventilators over the coming two weeks   matt hancock 5 april outcome the dhsc told the bbc that by 5 may the government had managed to make 10900 mechanical ventilators available to the nhs across the uk mr hancocks 18000 target was for this type of ventilator according to the dhsc the original uk target had been higher but was reduced mr hancock said because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus a spokesperson for the dhsc said every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one we continue to keep capacity ahead of demand this article was updated to reflect the latest figures on testing and contact tracers what claims do you want bbc reality check

        "text": "people whove been in close contact with someone found to have covid 19 in england and scotland are now being traced by thousands of health workers bbc news answers some of your questions on how the schemes will work the government advises that people who are self isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal if they can\u2019t work from home employers must ensure any self isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer employees in self isolation are entitled to statutory sick pay for every day they are in isolation worth \u00a39585 per week as long as they qualify however employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish if you are concerned about whether a call text or email is genuine you can check the nhs england test and trace service website or the scottish government test and protect website or the public health agency website in northern ireland genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details they will also not ask you to set up a password or pin over the phone or to call a premium rate number such as those starting 09 or 087 if you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in england you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web based service instead people experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test you can either do this via the nhs website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in england wales and northern ireland or 0800 028 2816 in scotland if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message email or phone the only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app that has not yet been launched in england outside the isle of wight when it is it will provide extra information for contact tracers but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online nothe department of health says the service will begin tracking those who tested positive in england on wednesday and going forward anyone who tested positive before that should already be self isolating for at least seven days with other members of their household self isolating for 14 days while most nhs contact tracers won\u2019t be trained health professionals there is also a clinical team of local public health experts which will deal with more complex cases the department of health says if someone who works in a care home tests positive it will be escalated to this team and it will work with the care home to agree the best course of action it will consider things like whether personal protective equipment was worn and whether staff had been able to remain at a distance from each other you will only be asked to report contacts known to you especially anyone in your household people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact less than 1m 3ft or have been within 2m 6ft of for more than 15 minutes the governments contact tracing app is not yet up and running when it becomes widely available it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage yes people who have previously tested positive will be asked to self isolate again thats because there are still a number of uncertainties about whether having coronavirus gives you immunity or whether people with immunity can transmit the illness to others health secretary matt hancock who tested positive for the virus in march told lbc radio that he would have to isolate if he was approached by a contact tracer no the tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive close contact means being less than 1m 3ft from somebody at any point or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes you shouldnt be that close to a delivery driver there is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in china in december 2019 its more precise name is covid 19 there are actually hundreds of coronaviruses   most of which circulate among animals including pigs camels bats and cats but there are a few   such as covid 19   that infect humans some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses such as the common cold covid 19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia most infected people will have only mild symptoms   perhaps a fever aching limbs a cough and loss of taste or smell   and will recover without special treatment but some older people and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease diabetes or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell the nhs has more about symptoms when people recover from an infection their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again this immunity is not always long lasting or totally efficient however and can decrease over time it is unclear though if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again university of oxford\u2019s prof sarah gilbert who is working on creating a vaccine for covid 19 says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future the uk government views antibody tests   which can show if a person has had covid 19   as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work but the world health organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d   the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms   is five days on average however some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this the world health organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days but some researchers say it may be up to 24 days knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important it allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus both viruses are highly contagious on average its thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people while those with flu pass it on to about one other person there are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus for four out of five people covid 19 will be a mild disease a bit like flu symptoms include fever a dry cough or loss of smell and tastehttps  wwwbbccouk news health 51048366 if the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia about one in seven people may need hospital treatment recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place some people will shrug off the illness quickly but for others the path to full health could take months and leave lasting problems diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home however some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors such as heart disease or obesity as well as diabetes   which put them at much higher risk of complications a third of virus deaths in england from 1 march to 11 may were linked to diabetes but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 insulin dependent or type 2 diabetes is still very low age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus say experts diabetes uk advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible as well as following social distancing measures dental practices in england have been told they can reopen on 8 june as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place these include limiting use of waiting areas screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers such as a plastic shield in reception areas elsewhere in the uk scotlands chief dental officer has expressed hope that routine dental care will be available by the end of july in wales the aim is to gradually reintroduce routine dental care before january 2021 and northern irish dentists are to discuss a schedule for reopening at a meeting on 2 june currently if a patient is in considerable pain dentists can refer them to an urgent dental care udc hub these centres have been created across the uk to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements if a udc centre is not available in your area there may be other options some hospitals for example offer emergency dental walk in services but you should always speak to your local dentist first   or use the nhs 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one asthma uks advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler usually brown as prescribed this will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus including coronavirus carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up if your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus contact the online nhs 111 coronavirus service coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses or diabetes there is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy   and who dont for instance have respiratory problems   are at greater risk from coronavirus covid 19 can in a small number of cases lead to pneumonia most notably in people with pre existing lung conditions but as this is a new virus no one will have any immunity to it whether they have previously had pneumonia or any other form of coronavirus such as sars wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public it presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip reading to communicate but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus especially if in a hospital setting the charity action on hearing loss says there are some clinically approved see through covered face masks that help enable lip reading however they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic they say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate there are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help yes according to the advice from public health england a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine the important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures so wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off and don\u2019t touch your eyes nose or mouth at all wash the face coverings after each time you use them for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care such as wool or silk and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained there is no vaccine for this new virus as there is for flu which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects all personal protective equipment ppe worn during the highest risk situations   such as aprons gloves and surgical masks   should usually be disposed of after a single use or session however guidelines now say nhs staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so for example some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused the health and safety executive says it recognises some compromise is needed in these exceptional circumstances but doctors and nurses are not happy with this situation the royal college of nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a last resort if adequate ppe has not been provided if you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self isolating you should keep all contact to a minimum and if possible not be in the same room together the person self isolating should stay in a well ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keep away from other people in the house if you live with someone who has symptoms youll also need to self isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started   this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear if you get symptoms self isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start even if it means youre self isolating for longer than 14 days if you do not get symptoms you can stop self isolating after 14 days the current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely wherever possible however those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period should talk to their gp or clinician this is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed if you live with your partner they count as being part of your household if neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact having sex wont increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another if one person does have symptoms they should be self isolating in a separate room using contraception such as condoms wont alter your risk of catching the virus as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway if you are going to touch each others genitals its likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time   and we know the virus is passed through saliva dr alex george told the bbcs newsbeat essentially any possibility of transfer of coronavirus   from your mouth to your hands to genitals to someone elses nose or mouth   increases the risk of passing on coronavirus it\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown because until recently there has been very little testing of the population as a whole it was mostly just those in hospital and some nhs and care staff who were being tested there is also a lag effect with the figures it takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases hospitalisations and then deaths   around three weeks at least   so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are it\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown but police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up what we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early april and the rate of infection has dropped significantly there\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised or dying from the virus where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the uk\u2019s care homes latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in england and wales   and nearly half of those in scotland and northern ireland   take place there following a drop in hospital patients with covid 19 the nhs has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in england urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted but gps will continue to use online consultations and regular testing will be offered to all staff the nhs says the pressure on many staff will remain unprecedented and employers must keep them safe routine elective surgery will be restarted with priority given to long waiters and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre covid 19 levels\u201d discussions are taking place in wales and northern ireland on how to resume normal nhs services scotlands health secretary has announced that nhs services will be gradually restarted without committing to any dates the simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know people who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the nhs in march and told not to go out for 12 weeks these are people with specific medical conditions the government is now advising these people   more than one million around the uk   to shield until the end of june vulnerable people in england and wales have been advised that from the beginning of june they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing shielding advice in northern ireland and scotland has not yet changed pregnant women are being advised by the uk government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum however they should attend antenatal clinics as normal there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus but for a small number of women being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection the government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk if your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection these would be passed on through breastfeeding breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk   cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently while trying to avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands this is highly unlikely to happen according to scientists and vets while there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals it is possible that a pets fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal but even without the threat of coronavirus you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead and avoid touching your nose and mouth in general children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus according to data from china and other countries this may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold however children with underlying lung problems such as asthma may have to be more careful all schools in the uk are currently closed except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers primary schools in england are starting to reopen from 1 june depending on the number   pupils in reception and years 1 and 6 are among the first to return its expected that about half of the children entitled to return will do so at present it is not compulsory for parents to send their children to school and there will be no fines for non attendance however the government says that eligible children are strongly encouraged to attend it is expected that this temporary arrangement   where usual sanctions do not apply   will continue for all parents of any year groups going back in england during the summer term there are currently no plans for schools in wales scotland or northern ireland to reopen before the end of the summer term you can walk your dog as much as you like the government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want and can spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household there is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead but the royal parks for instance urge visitors to do this to help ensure people practise social distancing the government has said people in england can exercise outside as many times a day as they want they can also spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household the welsh and scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day you still cant use playgrounds outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces in england you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance as long as you follow social distancing while you are there however in scotland and wales people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside in northern ireland there are no restrictions on travel for those who are not self isolating yes it is government guidance on staying at home says where parents do not live in the same household children under 18 can be moved between their parents homes if neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self isolating children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them however the family division of the high court has said that in england and wales if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice they may vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe even if the other parent does not agree where this is the case family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone the number of flights arriving in the uk has dropped dramatically during lockdown the uk government has said it will introduce a two week quarantine period for international passengers from 8 june if travellers cannot say where they plan to self isolate then they will do so in accommodation arranged by the government there are some exemptions including people arriving from the republic of ireland airlines and airport operators have said that maintaining social distancing is very difficult and many are advising passengers to wear face coverings and gloves healthrow is trialling large scale temperature checks for some passengers driving tests were suspended in england scotland and wales for three months from 20 march so unless it was booked for a date after 20 june the test will not take place as planned a similar situation is in place in northern ireland a new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the driver and vehicles standards agency dvsa you cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself you can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker in scotland wales and northern ireland taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed as it is not counted as an essential journey the department for transport has indicated that this is also still the case in england despite the recent lockdown changes however the aa says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if for example a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping people affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed will be added to the mortgage balance this means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre payment meter so you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you you could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up the government says that if its urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account you should be able to top up online as well and you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you so you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this if your flight is cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline ryanair for example says customers who want a cash refund will receive it in due course as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual with fewer staff many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re booking instead if the airline later folds the voucher will probably become invalid and any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance there is no specific guidance on this according to employment lawyer susie al qassab but as long as you are not unwell and your role permits it your employer should allow you to work from home on full pay if you cannot do your job from home then the unpaid leave may be seen as a suspension and may not be allowed you should check your contract to see what your employer is entitled to do if they are acting beyond their rights they will need to seek to reach an agreement with you not to attend work for a specific period which would usually need to be treated as paid leave statutory sick pay ssp is currently payable to all those who are self isolating you should query whether this is available to those who are self isolating because they have returned to the uk from abroad if you\u2019re self employed you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32500 per month if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic and you meet certain conditions you must have been self employed since at least the start of april 2019 and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350000 a year on average initially this was a one off payment designed to cover march april and may up to a maximum total of \u00a37500 in august applications will open for a second and final payment covering 70% of profits up to a cap of \u00a32190 a month for another three months \u00a36570 in total the scheme   which is called the coronavirus self employment income support scheme   is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self employment the government has said that everyone should work from home if possible and only go into a workplace if their job absolutely cannot be done from home your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety if you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus you could argue that you have a right not to come into work if you still do not want to go in you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave but your employer does not have to agree to this an employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason self employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self isolate may apply for two benefits   universal credit or employment and support allowance normally you would be eligible after four days of being ill however the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay ssp from the first day off but charities are worried that there is still a five week delay before universal credit is paid if you are employed your employer has an obligation to pay your statutory sick pay ssp for up to 28 weeks normally you would be eligible after four days of being ill however the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay ssp from the first day off in the case of small and medium sized employers the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days eligible employees are entitled to \u00a39585 a week anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the uk and are on a low income or out of work students in full time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit people aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child caring for a disabled person or cannot work you can use the governments benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to ultimately this is a personal decision but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now a recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally university campuses have been closed this term by the covid 19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn the university of cambridge has said it will have no face to face lectures in the next academic year and the university of manchester has said that to begin with its lectures will be taking place online only other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year before you make a firm choice the higher education watchdog office for students says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online on campus or a mixture and if the information isnt available next month it must be provided before clearing in august once you have all the information you need to weigh up whats important to you bear in mind the universities minister says youll have to pay full fees even if youre learning online   but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses also if your university can offer a campus experience access to facilities like libraries bars  and cafes is likely to be limited   so student life could be very different to normal the department for education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back in a statement it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d to claim a refund students first need to complain directly to their university if that is unsuccessful then students in england or wales can lodge an appeal with the office of the independent adjudicator oia if your university is in scotland then it\u2019s the spso scottish public services ombudsman and for northern ireland you go to the nipso northern ireland public services ombudsman  students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal most students have gone home to self isolate leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent if you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property first of all check your tenancy agreement some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice if you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d this could mean you pay less rent each month the ministry of justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits it says the measures are temporary and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point taking into account public health advice prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in march since then relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates or sending an email to the prison which is then printed out and passed on as a temporary measure secure phone handsets have been given to pre approved prisoners at 55 prisons allowing them to speak to a small number of pre authorised contacts video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions the earliest point at which places of worship could open is early july when the prime minister says some public places could reopen \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d however several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon ibrahim mogra a senior imam in leicester told the bbc that mosques present particular problems we are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship he said so we are talking about really large numbers of people the church of england says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year although the approach would vary on a regional basis the rt rev sarah mullally who\u2019s leading the church\u2019s plans for reopening says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books distancing within the church buildings and holy communion research conducted by the resolution foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600000 this year if you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the national careers service for advice on how to find job vacancies you can also search online for virtual job fairs this could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your cv and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job what questions do you have about

        "text": "lockdown measures are starting to be eased after more than two months of restrictions but how is everyday life changing from monday in england you will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households outside   either in parks or now also in private gardens   as long as you remain 2m 6ft apart from friday in scotland members of two different households will be allowed to meet up outdoors if you maintain social distancing groups cannot be bigger than eight and people are strongly recommended not to meet more than one other household per day in wales the bbc understands that people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from monday groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in northern ireland although outdoor weddings with 10 people present may be allowed from 8 june there is no longer any limit to the amount of time you can spend outside doing exercise or in open air recreation like sunbathing in england and from friday in scotland currently you can play outdoor sports such as golf or tennis with members of your household or with one other person from another household while maintaining social distance from monday people in england will also be able to exercise outside with up to five others from different households that means small groups of sport teams can resume fitness sessions but social distancing must be maintained in scotland outdoor activities where physical distancing can be maintained can resume from friday this includes golf tennis bowls and fishing households can also drive any distance in england to destinations such as parks and beaches but they should not travel to wales scotland or northern ireland where the rules are different decisions on easing lockdown in wales scotland and northern ireland are the responsibility of each national government however scotlands first minister nicola sturgeon has announced the lifting of some lockdown measures in the country from 29 may as well as meeting people from one other household outside people will also be able to sit or sunbathe in parks and open areas it will also be possible to travel   preferably by walking or cycling   for recreation although people will be asked to remain where possible within or close to their own local area rules in wales are set to be relaxed next week while any changes in northern ireland will be confirmed after the executive meets next thursday people who can work from home in england should continue to do so for the foreseeable future but the government says those who cant should travel to their workplace if it is open   and walk cycle or drive if at all possible to prevent overcrowding on public transport those who do use buses or trains are being told to expect social distance queuing and to wear face coverings workplaces should be made safe for staff with more cleaning staggered working shifts and for office workers no hot desking if youre a cleaner or plumber and need to enter someone elses home for your job you are allowed to return to work no work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of covid 19 symptoms unless its a household emergency in homes where someone is clinically vulnerable   for example where a person is aged over 70   face to face contact should be avoided and strict hygiene rules followed people in england and wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from monday 1 june while continuing to follow social distancing rules these people all have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus it means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household people living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing   keeping 2 metres apart other parts of the uk have not yet recommended the same house moves and viewings can resume again in england potential buyers and renters will be able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in childminders and nannies in england have now been told they can return to work   but only if theyre caring for youngsters who come from the same household during lockdown registered childminders have either been closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers the government has said it would like pre school nurseries in england to start reopening from 1 june the governments ambition is for all primary school children in england to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible in england pupils in nurseries early years and reception and years 1 and 6 at primary schools will be able to return from 1 june class sizes are expected to be no more than 15 pupils with staggered breaks and frequent hand washing from 15 june the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face to face contact with year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year in addition to their continued remote home learning meanwhile there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in september or whether they will be taught partially or completely online the university watchdog says new students must be told with absolute clarity how they will be taught before accepting a place all non essential retailers   from department stores to small independent shops   can reopen in england from 15 june if they put in place social distancing measures and outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 june if they are covid secure but the government has said these dates could change if coronavirus infection rates increase garden centres have already reopened in england wales and northern ireland they are now due to reopen in scotland diy chains   some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown   have also reopened many of their shops pubs restaurants hairdressers hotels cinemas and places of worship will open from 4 july at the earliest as long as they can meet social distancing measures however indoor public spaces such as beauty salons where social distancing may be difficult could reopen significantly later depending on when the rate of infection goes down the foreign office currently advises against all but essential journeys and the government has now said a two week quarantine period for people arriving in the uk will be introduced as soon as possible there will be some exemptions for people arriving from the republic of ireland as part of the common travel area if international travellers cannot say where they plan to self isolate for 14 days they will have to do so in accommodation arranged by the government all passengers are advised to remain 2m 6ft apart wherever possible they should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering   which some uk airports and airlines have made compulsory content available only in the uk"

        "text": "one of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year some airlines have grounded their entire fleets while others have been focusing on cargo flights in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can now however many carriers are making plans to get back in the air ryanair for example says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from july easyjet is starting a limited service this month and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of august while air france klm and lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of june hungarian carrier wizz air has already resumed flights in the uk the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 june   which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country but can passengers fly safely or will they be at risk of infection the covid 19 coronavirus is still relatively new so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply but previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses based on the available information us centers for disease control and prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections a 2018 study by researchers from emory university in atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases a droplet mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger thus transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger the researchers concluded but contrary to this earlier research   led by the same academics   had shown that in real life cases passengers with sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport while embarking or disembarking from the plane or from touching contaminated surfaces rather than by breathing in infected droplets the simulations also indicated that because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers they could generate several new infections and concluded it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill meanwhile public health officials in canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from guangzhou to toronto were found to have covid 19 the flight had 350 people on board and lasted for 15 hours although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections the chief engineer at aerospace giant airbus insists that is not the case jean brice dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean every two to three minutes mathematically all the air is renewed he says that means 20 to 30 times per hour the air around you is completely renewed put simply air is collected from outside the aircraft normally through the engine and mixed with recycled air from the cabin the recycled air which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels is passed through hepa high efficiency particulate air filters that are similar to those used in hospitals the covid 19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter a nanometre is a billionth of a metre and is within the particle size range that hepa filters capture   10 nanometres and above mr dumont says hepa filters have standards and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards they filter out 9997% of particulates small particles of the size of covid 19 the flow of the air itself he explains is also designed to minimise infection risks the air flows vertically it is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet that makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited so a passenger from row one for example cannot contaminate someone in row 20 but is this enough this regular flow of air from top to bottom can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles thus altering the path of any airborne particles and crucially while hepa filters do work they cant capture all covid 19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in says dr julian tang consultant virologist at the leicester royal infirmary and associate professor at leicester university he is also one of the team behind a study published this month looking at minimising the airborne transmission of covid 19 in enclosed spaces filtration only works on mass airflows most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short range face to face conversations close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane train or a bus   this is the biggest risk and even if you are further away the risk is not eliminated says dr tang how long covid 19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors it varies between different people it varies depending on the state of your infection and you cant say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres   and they all could be carrying the virus dr tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as covid 19 or mers sars and influenza something which they argue has been overlooked but mr dumont believes that simple precautions such as wearing masks and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks i want to be precise on that we want people to wear masks he says this he claims combined with the rapid replacement of air should minimise exposure so would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft for example by blocking out middle seats   a move contemplated by some airlines but described by ryanairs ceo michael oleary as idiotic we dont think so says mr dumont it doesnt add to the risk reduction we believe virologist dr tang disagrees the problem is that if youre sitting next to somebody   06 metres in economy say   whos coughing and sneezing in that immediate area that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system get filtered and come back down again meanwhile the international air transport association iata which represents airlines has set out a detailed biosecurity roadmap which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself but on the time spent in the airport   where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another it wants that time to be minimised as much as possible as a result it is calling for the actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk   and according to iata vice president nick careem physical distancing on board is not necessary the emphasis he says should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas that could include banning queues for the washrooms the key message mr careem says is that there is no silver bullet no single measure that can prevent infection dr tang meanwhile says he would fly with precautions if i get on a plane ill be wearing a mask its not 100% but at least ill have some protection"

put on leave due to the coronavirus outbreak and to prevent employers having to make mass redundancies so how does it work and who is eligible the government is currently paying the wages of more than a quarter of uk jobs through its furlough programme   the coronavirus job retention scheme it puts workers on leave and allows them to stay on the payroll about 84 million workers have been furloughed since march with the government paying 80% of their salaries up to \u00a32500 a month companies can top up this pay if they choose and must let employees know they have been furloughed the scheme   backdated to 1 march   opened to applications on 20 april by the end of may \u00a315bn of claims had been made it will run until the end of october and is expected to end up costing about \u00a380bn on 29 may mr sunak announced two changes from 1 july businesses can bring furloughed employees back to workplaces part time a month earlier than previously announced it will be down to individual firms to decide what part time means and pay the wages for that time they will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work for example mr sunak said an employer could bring someone back to work two days a week in that situation the employer would pay for those days while the furlough scheme would cover the employee for the other three working days from 1 august employers will have to pay national insurance and pension contributions furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay in september employers will then pay 10% of employees salaries   rising to 20% in october check you are eligible for the scheme and then work out how much to claim using the governments online calculator you can claim 80% of your employees wages   capped at \u00a32500 per employee per month before tax or \u00a357692 a week if employees are not paid set amounts each month   for example if they have returned from maternity leave or receive top up pay   you will need to calculate your claim manually or seek professional advice furlough covers overtime and commission payments built in to an employees salary but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses all the money claimed must be paid to your workers or to cover their national insurance and pension payments even if a firm is in administration hmrc will check your claim and pay you through a uk bank account if you are eligible claims take about six working days to process potentially yes if your company cant give you work to do because of the coronavirus outbreak the scheme covers those who were on an employers paye payroll on 19 march 2020 this includes full time and part time workers and employees on flexible zero hour or agency contracts you must be furloughed for at least three weeks and you can be furloughed more than once if you have been made redundant since 19 march your former employer can re hire you under the scheme but newly hired employees are not eligible any uk organisation with employees can apply but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training an individual can furlough an employee such as a nanny if they are paid through paye the self employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit if they meet certain conditions they must have been self employed since at least the start of april 2019 and earn an average of less than \u00a350000 in a tax year  those who receive it can continue to work the grant is a one off payment covering three months up to a maximum of \u00a37500 anyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before if you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough if you are on unpaid leave shielding for health reasons or have caring responsibilities you are also eligible staff on maternity paternity adoption or shared parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage if you are placed on furlough you cant do any work for your employer this will change from july onwards when the government says furloughed workers can return on a part time basis you can volunteer in the community or even for your company as long as you arent creating revenue or providing a service employers can give employees additional training but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage from july to october you may be able to work part time and be furloughed for the remainder of your hours if you work for more than one firm you can receive furlough from any of them up to \u00a32500 a month per employer you can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer provided you are not breaching any existing contracts companies dont have to keep on any employees when furlough ends and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages the hope is that by the time the scheme ends restrictions will have lifted and businesses can start paying full salaries again"

there might have been a minor breach  of the law mr cummings has maintained he behaved reasonably and legally throughout the episode mr cummings drove his family to durham to stay at his fathers farm on the evening of 27 march after his wife fell ill and suspecting that he might soon fall ill the next day he developed coronavirus symptoms and was self isolating by 12 april mr cummings was cleared to return to work and wanted to travel back to london he decided to go for a drive first to see whether he could drive safely my wife was very worried particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease she did not want to risk a nearly 300 mile drive with our child given how ill i had been he explained that after parking on the outskirts of barnard castle town he felt sick and the family walked about 10 15m and sat by the riverbank for about 15 minutes durham police have now investigated and said that if an officer had stopped mr cummings on the way to or from the town he would have been told to return to his fathers property if he had agreed no further action would have been taken the police view is that it might have been a minor breach of the regulations because mr cummings maintained social distancing   ie stayed more than 2m away from anyone according to adam king a senior criminal barrister at qeb hollis whiteman the use of the word might makes clear that its not the polices ultimate decision whether to determine reasonable excuse thats for the courts however if the polices view was that it was a reasonable excuse you would expect them to say that as they do in relation to the drive to durham he says many people have questioned whether it was dangerous to test his ability to drive with his wife and child in the car and said it was a breach of the highway code and motoring laws others have pointed out that it took place on his wifes birthday cabinet minister michael gove earlier defended the trip by saying it was consistent with the guidelines he also referred to a reason that mr cummings did not during his press conference it was part of the national police chiefs council npcc guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well mr gove said but the npcc guidance referred to by mr gove   which was publicised in mid april   says driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise was not likely to be reasonable when mr cummings originally took his family to durham to stay at a cottage on the family farm the police view was that the law wasnt broken durham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his fathers premises mr cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the health protection coronavirus restrictions england regulations 2020 the lockdown has been underpinned by both the law and various sets of government guidelines the police only deal with the law that says during the emergency period no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse the law gives examples of reasonable excuses such as obtaining necessities exercise medical need and travelling to work but the list is not exhaustive which means there can be reasonable excuses that are not on it there are lockdown rules that are in the guidelines but not in the law when mr cummings drove his family to durham he suspected his wife had coronavirus and the whole family should have been remaining in their home and self isolating according to the guidelines but he said he feared both him and his wife becoming incapacitated and unable to look after their four year old he has cited a section in the advice that says we are aware that not all these measures will be possible if you are living with children but keep following this guidance to the best of your ability on 2 april mr cummings son was taken to hospital in an ambulance after he threw up and had a bad fever the next day his son had recovered and seemed back to normal and mr cummings said he drove to the hospital to pick up his family as there were no taxis the night before mr cummings was so ill he could barely stand up he said and his wifes spectator piece described how he had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs for 10 days as he had coronavirus symptoms like fever mr cummings was supposed to be isolating on this car journey mr cummings said he did not get out or have contact with any strangers but were other forms of transport available there were taxi firms who were taking patients home from hospital in durham at that point however the government guidance told self isolating people do not use public transport or taxis but in march and april the north east ambulance service neas policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected covid 19 but without a confirmed test result mr cummings confirmed that his son was tested upon leaving the hospital but did not receive his negative result until a few days later so an ambulance could have taken them home a spokesperson for durham and darlington nhs foundation trust which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area told the bbc they could arrange ambulance transport via north east ambulance service in early april mr cummings was seen running out of 10 downing street on 27 march his wife mary wakefield in an article for the spectator magazine about having the virus wrote my husband did rush home to look after me in his press conference in the downing street rose garden mr cummings said his wife was feeling a bit better after a couple of hours there were many critical things at work and she urged me to return in the afternoon and i did public health england phe guidance published on 12 march stated that along with the infected individual all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days mr cummings returned home again in the evening and spoke with his wife she was ill she might have covid although she did not have a cough or a fever in his prepared statement at the recent press conference mr cummings said for years i have warned of the dangers of pandemics last year i wrote about the possible threat from coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning journalists quickly found a blog by the adviser from last year that mentioned sars a single time but it was soon established by a bit of internet sleuthing that the blog had been edited to contain this coronavirus reference on the evening of 14 april this year the day mr cummings returned to work from

        "text": "uk prime minister boris johnsons most senior adviser dominic cummings has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to durham during lockdown what did he do and what does the guidance say 23 march the prime minister tells the uk public they must stay at home people are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with those with symptoms had already been told to self isolate 27 march mr cummings is seen leaving 10 downing street  i suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four year old child she told me she suddenly felt badly ill  he went home but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work guidance if mr cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus the guidance was that all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days evening mr cummings went on to explain   that evening i returned home and discussed the situation with my wife she was ill she might have covid although she did not have a cough or a fever mr cummings said many people he worked closely with including the pm had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms he said i thought there was a distinct probability that i had already caught the disease later  mr cummings drove up to durham with his family arriving at roughly midnight i was worried that if my wife and i were both seriously ill possibly hospitalised there was nobody in london we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to covid my wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier mr cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child guidance stay at home is the simple government advice for households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms however the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved it says if you have children keep following this advice to the best of your ability however we are aware that not all these measures will be possible other government advice did not contain this caveat such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of march to be sent to every house nor did the government page on essential travel which said essential travel does not include visits to second homes whether for isolation purposes or holidays people must remain in their primary residence durham police said on 28 may that it did not consider that going to durham had been an offence the police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether mr cummings had breached the regulations not the general government guidance to stay at home 28 march mr cummings says he woke up in pain and clearly had covid symptoms including a bad headache and a serious fever 30 march a no 10 source confirmed mr cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self isolating at home 1 april durham constabulary speak to the father of dominic cummings who confirms that his son and family were present at the property 2 april during the night mr cummings four year old son threw up and had a bad fever following medical advice an ambulance took the child to hospital he was accompanied by mr cummings wife mr cummings could barely stand up 3 april after being taken to hospital mr cummings son woke up the next day having recovered he was tested for coronavirus and his mother who was with him at the hospital was told they should return home the test result arrived days later and was negative according to mr cummings there were no taxis so he drove to the hospital picked him up and returned home he said he did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip but according to his wifes later article in the spectator mr cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period guidance people with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus and who do not require hospital treatment are told they must remain at home until they are well in march and april the north east ambulance service neas policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected covid 19 but without a confirmed test result a spokesperson for durham and darlington nhs foundation trust which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area told the bbc they could arrange ambulance transport via north east ambulance service in early april 6 april at some point in the week leading up to this date mr cummings discussed his decision to travel to durham with the prime minister when we were both sick and in bed he said i mentioned to him what i had done unsurprisingly given the condition we were in neither of us remember the conversation in any detail 4 11 april mr cummings said after i started to recover one day in the second week i tried to walk outside the house he confirmed he his wife and his son went for a walk into woods owned by his father and it was at this point he was seen by passers by but his family had no interaction with them the exact date is not clear but his second week isolating in durham would have between these two dates guidance advice concerning outdoor exercise changed during the second week in april when mr cummings and his family walked in the woods until 9 april people with coronavirus symptoms and their household were told they could exercise outdoors on that date the phe advice changed to say any exercise should be taken within your home a separate nhs guidance page said people isolating could use their gardens 11 april believing he had recovered by this date albeit feeling weak and exhausted mr cummings said he sought expert medical advice i explained our familys symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on monday or tuesday seek childcare and so on i was told that it was safe and i could return to work 12 april mr cummings drives to barnard castle about 25 miles from his parents home in durham with his wife and child he explained this episode as needing to test his driving was fine before making the long drive back to london he said hed been having problems with his vision guidance on 28 may durham police said the drive to barnard castle might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention it added that the offence was minor because there did not appear to have been any breach of the social distancing rules the statement said that if an officer had stopped mr cummings on the way to barnard castle they would advised him to return to durham the constabulary said it would not be taking retrospective action against him because it would not do so against any other member of the public there was no mention in the statement of whether mr cummings was fit to drive given his concerns about his eyesight the 1988 road traffic act says if a person drives a motor vehicle on a road while his eyesight is such whether through a defect which cannot be or one which is not for the time being sufficiently corrected that he cannot comply with any requirement as to eyesight prescribed under this part of this act for the purposes of tests of competence to drive he is guilty of an offence the highway code says you must report to the driver and vehicle licensing agency dvla any health condition likely to affect your driving sir peter fahy former chief constable of manchester police said the drive to barnard castle was potentially a criminal offence its not the way to test your eyesight and put potentially other people in danger on twitter john apter chair of the police federation for england and wales said if youre feeling unwell and your eyesight may be impaired do not drive your vehicle to test your ability to drive its not a wise move michael gove also referred to a reason that mr cummings did not during his press conference it was part of the national police chiefs council npcc guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well in the npcc guidance referred to by mr gove   which was publicised in mid april   driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise was deemed not likely to be reasonable mr cummings and his family walked a few yards and sat by a riverbank for a few minutes 13 april mr cummings and his family travel back to london 14 april mr cummings is seen in downing street for the first time since 27 march in his recent press conference mr cummings said he had written about the possible threat from coronaviruses last year but it transpired an old blog was edited on the evening of 14 april to add a short section on this 19 april five days after being in london the observer and mirror report that mr cummings is seen again in durham by an unnamed witness mr cummings says he did not return to durham and that evidence on his phone proves this mr cummings insisted he did not break the law saying i believe that in all the circumstances i behaved reasonably and legally balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in number 10 he said i dont regret what i did and added that the rules make clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and the situation i was in was exceptional circumstances"

        "text": "as the crisis has unfolded scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus while many people who become infected develop a cough fever and loss of taste and smell others have no symptoms at all and never realise theyre carrying covid 19 researchers say its vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether silent spreaders are fuelling the pandemic when people gathered at a church in singapore on 19 january no one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus it was a sunday and as usual one of the services was being conducted in mandarin among the congregation at the life church and missions on the ground floor of an office building was a couple both aged 56 whod arrived that morning from china as they took their seats they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus at that time a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of covid 19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it the couple left as soon as the service was over but shortly afterwards things took a turn for the worse and in a wholly confusing way the wife started to become ill on january 22 followed by her husband two days later because they had flown in from wuhan the epicentre of the outbreak that was no big surprise but over the following week three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason leading to one of singapores first and most baffling coronavirus cases working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims we were extremely perplexed says dr vernon lee head of communicable diseases at singapores ministry of health people who didnt know one another somehow infected each other while showing no sign of illness this new batch of cases simply did not make sense according to what was known about covid 19 back then so dr lee and his fellow scientists along with police officers and specialist disease trackers launched an investigation generating detailed maps showing who was where and when this involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing   a version of which is getting under way now in the uk its seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out and singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out amazingly within a few days investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that sunday they quickly established that two of the singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the chinese couple they could have spoken to each other greeted each other during the usual activities of a church service says dr lee that was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on apart from one key factor it did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease and on top of that was an even greater puzzle it was confirmed that the third singaporean to become infected a 52 year old woman had not been at the same service as the others instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day so how could she have picked up the virus investigators resorted to going through the cctv recordings made at the church that sunday to search for clues and they stumbled across something completely unexpected   the woman whod attended the later service after the chinese couple had left had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier somehow despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill the chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus maybe theyd had it on their hands and touched the seats maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface its not clear but the implications were huge for dr lee piecing everything together there was only one possible explanation   that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising this was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others but if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms silently and invisibly how could the disease be stopped he remembers the moment while working in his office when the reality dawned on him every time you make a scientific discovery it is like a eureka moment when you realise that this is something important that youve uncovered through the hard work of many individuals and teams what was revealed was whats known as pre symptomatic transmission where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin along with many others this study highlighted a critical period of 24 to 48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious perhaps even their most infectious being aware of that is potentially invaluable because as soon as you realise youre ill then everyone youve been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home that would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start but exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate one option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job if the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then its possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation anyone close enough especially indoors could easily pick it up and another potential form of transmission is by touch   the virus gets onto someones hands and they touch another person or a door handle   or a seat in a church whatever the route the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if theyre not aware that they might be infected this is an even more mysterious scenario and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to its one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it this is whats known as being asymptomatic because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself the most famous case is that of an irish woman who was working as a cook in new york at the beginning of the last century wherever mary mallon was employed in house after house people became ill with typhoid and at least three maybe many more died of it but she was completely unaffected eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease reporters dubbed her typhoid mary a label she always resented but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938 staff nurse amelia powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic she was at work on her hospital ward at addenbrookes hospital in cambridge in april when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test she had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with covid 19 but suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because to her horror she had tested positive it was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed it was surreal i thought this cant be right not me im absolutely fine says 23 year old amelia she had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home i was worried because ive seen the other side with patients deteriorating very quickly with it so i did wonder if this would happen to me but to her surprise at no point did she feel unwell i had nothing literally   i was exercising indoors eating normally sleeping normally at the moment its impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view the discovery that amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital it produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test an even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the diamond princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of japan earlier this year later branded a petri dish for infection it had around 700 cases researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms and at a care home in washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases that was the conclusion of an analysis by prof carl heneghan of the university of oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects the upshot they said was that there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics and they said that if the screening for covid 19 is only carried out on people with symptoms   which has been the main focus of uk testing policy   then cases will be missed perhaps a lot of cases the biggest concern of amelia the nurse was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help i dont think i passed it on because all the colleagues i work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long id been positive for she says but we still dont know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not   its very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal one study in china which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities as silent spreaders the scientists wrote asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control the team that studied that diamond princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so theyre estimated to have caused a significant number of cases to try to get an answer scientists in norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested asymptomatic cases may be the dark matter of the epidemic according to prof neil hall head of the earlham institute a life science research centre whos leading the initiative dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe and its yet to be identified prof hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic keeping it going despite public health measures if you have people who dont know theyre ill while using public transport and health care facilities inevitably thats going to increase transmission he says any intervention thats only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem a team of scientists in california believes that not knowing whos carrying the virus without symptoms is the achilles heel of the fight against the pandemic in their view the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out whos infected regardless of whether they think they are or not that was also the recommendation of mps on the commons science and technology committee in a letter to the prime minister boris johnson they wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic and they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people   such as health workers or care workers   should be given regular testing a similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the chinese city of wuhan where the pandemic is thought to have begun as many as 65 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease   including in those showing no symptoms as lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport return to work or go shopping getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever at the moment there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing thats why governments the world over say its essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self isolates they also advise that the best defence remains social distancing   to keep apart wherever you can but where that isnt possible the recommendation is to cover your face even with a mask thats homemade when the us government announced this policy it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in singapore back in january the logic is that this is not about protecting yourself its about protecting others from you in case youre infected but dont know it many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing or increase the risk of contamination if theyre clumsily handled but more and more governments most recently that of the uk have become convinced of the benefits not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own but because theres still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission almost anything is worth a try when you talk to intensive care doctors across the uk exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of covid 19 one phrase emerges time after time weve never seen anything like this before"
