        "text": "Thousands of people have joined anti-racism demonstrations across the UK. The protests, sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, were held in cities including London, Manchester, Cardiff, Leicester and Sheffield. In London, protesters knelt for a minute's silence before chanting \"no justice, no peace\" and \"black lives matter\". The majority of the day's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Police horses were used to regain control, but one horse galloped ahead and its rider fell to the ground after hitting her head on a traffic light. Her injuries are not life-threatening, the Metropolitan Police said. Fourteen people were arrested and 14 officers were injured after a smaller group became \"angry and intent on violence\", the force added. In a tweet, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told the protesters \"I stand with you and I share your anger and your pain\" and said the small minority of people who became violent \"let down this important cause\". The protests went ahead despite officials advising against mass gatherings due to coronavirus. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the social distancing advice was \"for the safety of all of us\", while Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the protests were \"unlawful\". Thousands of people gathered in the capital, the majority donning face coverings and many with gloves. Some held signs made reference to coronavirus, including one which read: \"There is a virus greater than Covid-19 and it's called racism\". Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland, police said they had issued \"a significant number\" of fines given the dangers of crowds in the pandemic and organisers would now be reported to the Public Prosecution Service with a view to prosecution. Protests began in the US after a video emerged of Mr Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, being arrested by four officers on 25 May in Minneapolis. Videos showed Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, dying after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The footage - seen all around the world - showed him gasping that he could not breathe. An officer has been charged with murder while three of his colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting the killing. At a protest in his hometown of Watford, Britain's world heavyweight champion boxer Anthony Joshua told the crowds: \"We can no longer sit back and remain silent on this senseless, unlawful killing and sly racism on another human being.\" In central London, protesters dropped to one knee and raised their fists in the air outside the US embassy amid chants of \"silence is violence\" and \"colour is not a crime\". Sarah Law, a 27-year-old train manager, said: \"I don't want my future children to experience what I have. It's time for us all to unite together regardless of our race and stand up for what is right.\" O'Neall Rawle, a 27-year-old teacher from Leicester, said he was protesting because he was \"exhausted of being treated as a second class citizen\" and \"to hopefully spark some change\". Meanwhile, in Glasgow, anti-racism campaigners renamed streets that have links to the slave trade, replacing street signs with the names of enslaved Africans, black activists and victims of police brutality. Demonstrations are scheduled in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen on Sunday. In Manchester about 15,000 protesters gathered at Piccadilly Gardens in the city centre, clapping in unison and holding placards bearing the initials BLM. Elsewhere, several hundred people marched in Newcastle, while many more took part in an online protest organised in the north-east of England. More protests took place across Europe on Saturday and huge rallies are taking place in major cities across the US. Coronavirus regulations for England don't specifically mention protests but do restrict \"public gatherings\" to no more than six people - that would make large protests illegal. Police officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices (starting at \u00a3100) to people who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence. Whether they do this in practice is another matter and policing large protests during the coronavirus pandemic presents a challenge. Dame Cressida has said officers will \"seek to uphold the law\" but will have to make a \"case-by-case\" decision on what to do. She told the London Assembly on 3 June that if they had tried to enforce a mass dispersal at last weekend's protests, \"we would probably have ended up with very serious disorder\".

        "text": "Huge peaceful rallies have taken place across the US against racism and police brutality on the 12th day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd. Tens of thousands of people marched in Washington DC, in the city's largest protest so far. Security forces blocked any approach to the White House. Crowds also demonstrated in New York, Chicago, LA and San Francisco. Meanwhile, people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in North Carolina, where he was born, before a memorial service. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May. Video showed a white police officer kneeling on his neck for almost nine minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Officer Derek Chauvin has been dismissed and charged with murder. Three other officers who were at the scene have also been sacked and charged with aiding and abetting. Large anti-racism protests also took place in a number of other countries. In the UK, Parliament Square in central London was filled with people despite calls by the government to avoid mass gatherings for fear of spreading the coronavirus. In Australia, there were major protests in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany and Spain. The largest appeared to be in Washington DC, where protesters - many of them carrying placards saying \"Black Lives Matter\" - gathered peacefully near the Capitol, the Lincoln Memorial and outside Lafayette Park, next to the White House, at the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza. Mayor Muriel Bowser welcomed people, saying the crowds had sent a message to President Donald Trump. On Monday, federal law enforcement officers fired tear gas to clear a protest in the area ahead of a visit to a church by the president. \"If he can take over Washington DC, he can come for any state, and none of us will be safe,\" she said. \"Our soldiers should not be treated that way, they should not be asked to move on American citizens.\" Ms Bowser has requested the withdrawal of all federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops from the city, saying their presence is \"unnecessary\". One 35-year-old protester, Eric Wood, told the BBC: \"I'm here because I really couldn't afford not to be here. Racism has long been a part of the US.\" Crystal Ballinger, 46, said she felt hopeful about the movement this time. \"I feel something different about this protest...  I'm hopeful that the message of solidarity and equality is getting out.\" Many of the city curfews imposed after initial unrest have now been lifted. With restrictions eased, arrests have plummeted. However, late on Saturday police in Portland, Oregon, declared an \"unlawful assembly and civil disturbance\" after projectiles were thrown at officers near the Justice Center. Fifty arrests had been made by the early hours. Seattle police also said projectiles had been thrown and several officers were hurt by \"improvised explosives\". Earlier in New York, crowds crossed the Brooklyn Bridge, while in San Francisco demonstrators briefly shut the Golden Gate Bridge. In Chicago, about 30,000 people rallied in Union Park, and a Hollywood intersection was blocked by protesters in Los Angeles. And in Richmond, Virginia, a statue of a Confederate general was pulled down from its pedestal. There were also protests in Atlanta and Philadelphia, where crowds chanted, \"We need justice, we need love\". Meanwhile, the top editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer resigned after publishing a headline that equated property damage to the deaths of black people, which prompted public condemnation from many of the newspaper's staff. Stan Wischnowski apologised for what he described as a \"horribly wrong\" decision to use the headline \"Buildings Matter Too\" on an article about civil unrest in the US. In Buffalo, two policemen were charged with second-degree assault after they were filmed pushing a 75-year old protester to the ground, seriously injuring him. In his overnight tweets, President Trump thanked the police, Secret Service and National Guard for doing a \"fantastic job\" and said that the Washington crowd was \"much smaller than anticipated. By Helier Cheung, BBC News, Washington DC The crowd was diverse - with people of different ethnicities, and families with children - and there was an upbeat, if determined, mood. Music was being played and food, water and hand sanitiser handed out, as protesters chanted \"George Floyd\", \"Breonna Taylor\" - who was shot by police in March - and \"No justice, no peace\". The protest's movements appeared quite spontaneous. At one point, demonstrators did an impromptu march, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue before looping back towards the White House. At another, the entire street of demonstrators dropped on one knee at the same time, in a mark of solidarity. Sisters Sarina Lecroy, 20, and Grace, 16, said they were protesting for the first time, and that they believed the extent of the public outrage and the nationwide nature of these protests could lead to police reforms. \"We're just getting started this time, but it [the movement] does feel much more collective than in the past,\" said Sarina. Many placards also reflected the growing debate about how white people should help the cause. One placard held by a demonstrator read: \"I may never understand, but I will stand with you.\" On social media and on the streets, those in support of the movement have called on elected officials to address longstanding systemic racism and inequalities, from police brutality to mass incarceration to healthcare. Black Americans are jailed at five times the rate of white Americans and sentenced for drug offences six times more, often despite equal rates of drug use, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Black mothers die in childbirth at over twice the rate of white mothers, according to national health data. Decades of government-sanctioned segregation have also seen inequalities across school systems, housing and other public resources. A 2019 Pew Research Center study found more than eight in 10 black adults say the legacy of slavery still affects black Americans' position today. Half say it is unlikely America will ever see true racial equality. Hundreds of people paid their respects to Mr Floyd in Raeford, North Carolina, laying flowers at a public viewing of his body in a church near where he was born. A private memorial service was then held for members of his family. Governor Roy Cooper ordered that flags be flown at half-mast from sunrise to sunset on Saturday in Mr Floyd's honour. Mr Floyd's funeral is due to take place on Tuesday in Houston, where he lived before moving to Minneapolis. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis&comma Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer&comma Derek Chauvin&comma kneeling on Mr Floyd\u2019s neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying \"I can\u2019t breathe\". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places&comma like Portland&comma Oregon&comma protesters lie in the road&comma chanting \"I can\u2019t breathe\". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floyd\u2019s arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. \u00a0He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning \"when the looting starts&comma the shooting starts\". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for \"glorifying violence\". 29 May A CNN reporter&comma Omar Jimenez&comma is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin&comma 44&comma is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4&comma400 people have been arrested. \u00a0Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and \"defend their residents\" he will deploy the army and \"quickly solve the problem for them\". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets.

        "text": "NHS trusts were not consulted before the government announced changes to the use of face coverings and visitor policy in English hospitals, the chief executive of NHS Providers has said. Chris Hopson said trust leaders felt \"completely in the dark\" about the \"significant and complex\" changes. From 15 June, hospital visitors and outpatients must wear face coverings and staff must use surgical masks. The Department of Health says masks can be provided by the hospital if needed. A spokeswoman said that, while the public were \"strongly urged\" to wear a face covering while inside hospitals, no-one would be denied care. Separately, NHS England has lifted the national suspension on hospital visiting with new guidance for NHS trusts. The guidance, which states visiting will be subject to the discretion of individual trusts and other NHS bodies, advises measures to support visiting, such as: The Department of Health said trusts had all of next week to implement the changes and that it had made NHS England aware of the announcement before it was made public. But Mr Hopson said the announcement by Health Secretary Matt Hancock on Friday was \"rushed out\" with \"absolutely no notice or consultation\" of NHS trust leaders. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It's the latest in a long line of announcements that have had a major impact on the way the NHS operates, in which frontline organisations feel they've been left completely in the dark, and they're then expected to make significant and complex operational changes either immediately or with very little notice.\" He said trust leaders were worried there was not enough strategy or planning and that it felt like \"last minute decisions are being made on the hoof that seem overly influenced by politics and that need to fill the space of the Downing Street press conferences\". The announcement had left many unanswered questions, such as when it was appropriate for staff to wear face masks, the numbers of masks needed and how they would be distributed, he added. Mr Hopson called for a \"proper, sensible forward plan and forward strategy of what we are trying to do, where trusts are given the time and space they need to do complex and difficult things\". Meanwhile, 40,465 people have now died with the virus, an increase of 204, according to the latest government figures. A further 10 people have died of coronavirus in Wales, while there were six deaths registered in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. Earlier, NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said trusts were also nervous about the imminent lifting of some patient visiting restrictions. She said they needed time to \"put in place processes and guidance to ensure that patients can receive visitors safely and while adhering to social distancing and infection control measures\". Mr Hopson's criticism was echoed by the British Medical Association (BMA), which warned there was \"little detail\" on how the policy would be implemented, where the masks would come from or how outpatients and visitors would be given them. Consultants committee chairman Dr Rob Harwood said: \"Given the lack of PPE supplies throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, it is absolutely crucial that the government ensures there are enough supplies of face masks for staff, and adequate provision of face coverings for outpatients and the public by the 15 June.\" It comes as the UK's death toll passed 40,000 on Friday according to government figures. The UK is only the second country - after the US with 108,000 deaths - to pass the milestone. Also at the Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock appealed to people not to attend large demonstrations with more than six people, saying he was \"appalled\" by the killing of George Floyd in the US but \"coronavirus remains a real threat\". Thousands ignored his plea to take part in the protests across the UK, with the majority of those at the London gathering wearing face coverings. The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn by the general public in situations where social distancing is difficult, eg on public transport, in shops - particularly for over 60s and those with underlying health conditions In other developments:"

        "text": "There have been warnings coronavirus may be starting to spread again in the north-west and the south-west of England. Some scientists say the R number is creeping up across the country and may have surpassed one - the point at which the epidemic takes off again - in these regions. Tameside Council has \"strongly\" advised schools not to reopen on Monday. The government insists the number is not above one anywhere in the country. So, what is going on? How worried should we be? And what does it mean for lifting lockdown? It is the number of people each infected person, on average, passes the virus onto. If the R is three, then 10 people would infect 30 others. But if R is 0.5, those 10 people would infect only five. An R of one is the crucial threshold. Anything lower and an epidemic is in decline, but if it goes higher then cases increase exponentially. That R is increasing across England. One team at Public Health England (PHE) and the University of Cambridge says this has been the clear pattern in their data since 11 May, when restrictions in England were eased. Their findings suggest we're now balanced on the edge of a knife. \"Both the north-west and south-west are just above one, but all regions are straddling one,\" said Dr Paul Birrell, one of the researchers. But this is just one mathematical model and there is huge uncertainty in the figures. The PHE data gives a figure between 0.72 and 1.2 for London. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine agrees the south-west may be above one, but paints a more optimistic view of the rest of England and their R number for the north-west is just 0.8. \"Overall, I would say we see R creeping up,\" Dr Sebastien Funk, from the London School, told the BBC. They also say the R number is 0.8 in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It would be easy to say yes, but the reality is confusing and it is important to understand what is driving any changes in R. \"It's complicated, the reasons are many and difficult to untangle,\" Dr Funk told me. The most straightforward explanation is that the virus is genuinely spreading more. As the PHE report says: \"We believe that this is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings.\" But due to a counter-intuitive quirk of maths, lockdown can be a success, cases fall and R still goes up. If cases collapse in the community - which appears to be happening - but come down more slowly in care homes and hospitals - which we also think is happening - then these areas will drag the R number back up, even though the situation is improving. And when you get to low levels of infection, all the estimates become more uncertain and that too can make R appear higher. \"It's a weird thing about R, it tells you the rate of change, and once all the way down, you can't have R at a low level,\" said Dr Funk. There is no perfect way of measuring R. The government takes advice from multiple modelling groups, including the two above, which all estimate the figure from different angles. Some give more positive, others more negative, views on R. It is the job of Sage, the government's group of science advisors, led by chief science advisor Sir Patrick Vallance, to come to an overall view. The official position is the R for the whole of the UK is between 0.7 and 0.9. Sage sources say, in their view, there is no region that has an R above one but some areas are \"very close\". Sir Patrick has consistently and publicly warned there is little room for manoeuvre in easing lockdown as R is on the cusp of one. John Edmunds, professor of infectious disease modelling at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, says it could take some time to identify a rising R number. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday the delay is \"really concerning\". \"Numbers are relatively small, our measures are quite crude, so it would take some time to detect an increase in say the reproduction number,\" he said. \"There are still quite a few infections in the community. I'd prefer to see fewer infections in the community. \"One in 600 is still quite a high rate. So I think it would be safer if we drove that rate right down before we ease things too much.\" The first point is the number of cases is vital too. A high R is more of a problem when there is a lot of virus around. \"R shouldn't be taken in isolation about the current level of threat,\" said Dr Birrell. The south-west has always had relatively few cases - currently 778 infections a day, according to PHE. However, Dr Birrell says the north-west - 4,170 infections a day - is \"more worrying\". Also, relaxing lockdown is putting pressure on the \"R number\" to increase. Some school children are back in the classroom, businesses are reopening and we can see more people while maintaining social distance. The full effect of this is expected to be seen in the official data in the coming weeks. Dr Funk said: \"We're pretty close to R equals one whichever way you look at it, we're lifting restrictions and if we see a sustained R greater than one then we need to do something about it. \"A day above one doesn't concern me, a couple of weeks does.\" The next stage of controlling coronavirus will depend on getting a detailed picture of what is happening up and down the country. The plan is to use \"local lockdowns\" that target clusters of cases that may be linked to a business or a care home. But this will require an even more precise picture of what is going on than in these models. PHE lumps the north-east and Yorkshire into one region. It is a tidy 190-mile drive from Sheffield to Berwick-upon-Tweed. Follow James on Twitter"

        "text": "Former Commons Speaker John Bercow has told the BBC he is \"sorry\" that he has not been granted a peerage. Previous outgoing Speakers have been given a seat in the House of Lords, but the government has not put forward Mr Bercow's name for consideration. The ex-Conservative MP has been accused of bullying by his former colleagues but denies the claims. He told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions he had \"made a lot of enemies\" during his 10-year stint in the Commons. Mr Bercow accepted he was \"periodically irascible\" and \"wouldn't take no for an answer\", but insisted: \"I don't think I bullied anyone, anywhere, in any way, at any time.\" He stepped down as Speaker in October after a decade in the post, during which time he faced accusations of bias over Brexit, as well as questions over his own behaviour towards colleagues. The Speaker is in charge of what goes on within the House of Commons. By tradition, the Speaker is above politics and is supposed to represent only the rules and conventions of Parliament. Once elected to the post, the Speaker no longer represents any political party. Mr Bercow told BBC political correspondent Chris Mason that serving as Speaker had been \"my enormous privilege\". \"I did my best - I had some successes, I had some failures. I endured controversies. I made friends, I incurred enemies as well,\" he added. He said, despite \"a long-standing convention\" of giving peerages to former Speakers, the matter was \"best decided by other people\". \"I am not going to sit awake at night worrying about it. \"There are people who have got grievances and agendas of their own who think I just don't fit.\" He would not comment on reports that he was under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over allegations of bullying, saying only \"in due course people will know what the truth is\". Mr Bercow has been proposed for a peerage by the former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, amid suggestions by the opposition that the ex-Speaker is being denied a seat for his hostility to the UK leaving the EU. During his time in the role, Mr Bercow gave unprecedented powers to backbenchers to hold ministers to account and made controversial and far-reaching procedural decisions at key stages of the Brexit process. In February, he told the BBC there was a \"conspiracy\" to keep him out of the House of Lords. He named no names, but said it was \"blindingly obvious\" that there was a \"concerted campaign\" to prevent him from being given a peerage. Cabinet minister Robert Jenrick said there was \"no obligation\" on the prime minister to give Mr Bercow a peerage and the allegations against him need to be investigated. Mr Bercow is facing at least one formal complaint regarding his behaviour in the Speaker's chair. He has dismissed claims there was a pattern of bullying towards his subordinates, and maintains that the \"vast majority\" of his relationships with colleagues both inside and outside Parliament were constructive. He told BBC Radio 4 he was upset not to have been given the opportunity to take a seat in the House of Lords. \"I am not going to pretend it doesn't matter,\" he said, adding that he would like \"to make a contribution\". Mr Bercow added: \"I am just going to go on doing what I think is right, standing up for good causes [and] celebrating important principles.\""

        "text": "Tens of thousands of people have protested across Australia in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Rallies were held despite warnings from officials over the coronavirus. A ban in Sydney was lifted only at the last minute and some organisers have been fined for breaking health rules. The marches were inspired by the death of African American George Floyd in police custody but also highlighted the mistreatment and marginalisation of Australia's Aboriginal people. Rallies were organised in Brisbane, Melbourne, Hobart, Adelaide and elsewhere. They were held in high spirits with no reports of major unrest. There were a few tense scenes later in the evening at Sydney's Central Station, with police using pepper spray, but there were only three arrests in the city overall, among a total of 20,000 protesters, police said. Although the rallies were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, many in Australia were also protesting against the treatment of its indigenous population by police. Banners reading \"I can't breathe\" remembered the words of Floyd before his death, while another said: \"Same story, different soil.\" The Sydney protest had been ruled unlawful on Friday by the New South Wales Supreme Court under coronavirus social distancing rules. NSW Police Minister David Elliott had said: \"Freedom of speech isn't as free as we would like it to be at the moment. Rules at the moment are clear.\" But organisers took the case to the state court of appeal and it overturned the ban on Saturday afternoon, just 15 minutes before the scheduled start. The protest was authorised for 5,000 people. Health ministry directions would normally prohibit public gatherings of more than 10 people. Frances Mao, BBC News, Sydney I've covered so many protests in my home city in the past decade. Outside of climate change rallies at the start of the year, I can't recall a larger turnout, particularly for a rally about race. They turned up even when it was initially illegal and despite the health fears. They were angry, they were passionate, they knew there were risks but they donned masks and carried signs anyway. This is a resounding success for indigenous Australia. Back in January people were struggling to breathe due to smoke from the bushfires. Today they were chanting \"I can't breathe\" - the choked words of George Floyd, but also David Dungay-  an Aboriginal man who was fatally pinned down by five police officers in 2015. For many Australians, the US protests have ignited fierce introspection of their country's own record of black deaths in custody. Aboriginal people remain the most incarcerated in the world by percentage of population - they make up just 3% of the nation's people but almost 30% of those in jail. This has been the rate for decades - in fact it's become worse - but only now does there appear to be a large demand in the mainstream for change. Organisers across Australia encouraged those attending rallies to use hand sanitisers and observe social distancing. Images showed that although the majority of demonstrators have been wearing face coverings, many of the protesters have been close together. The chief health official in the state of Victoria said it was \"not the time to be having large gatherings\". Victoria police said on Saturday they would be fining organisers A$1,652 ($1,150; \u00a3900) each for breaking health rules. It was unclear if Melbourne's attending protesters would be fined. Protesters chanted: \"Always was, always will be Aboriginal land\" and \"Too many coppers not enough justice\". Leon Saunders, 77, demonstrating in Sydney, said: \"The raw deal Aborigines have been getting in this country for my lifetime and many lifetimes before that is just not right. \"We can look at America and say what terrible things are happening over there but, right here on our home soil, there are just as bad things happening and they need to be improved.\" A 1991 inquiry reported on 99 deaths of Aboriginal people in police custody, but a Guardian study found that at least 432 had died in custody since then. Another protester in Sydney, Sarah Keating, said: \"I thought Australians were resting on their laurels - just because we're not as bad as America doesn't mean we're good enough... 432 Aboriginal deaths in custody is atrocious. That number should never have gotten that high. It should just be zero.\" No police officer has ever been held criminally responsible for an Aboriginal death in custody. Many of the demonstrators in Brisbane were wrapped in indigenous flags."

        "text": "The National Football League has said players should be allowed to protest during the national anthem as rallies against racial discrimination continue. \"We were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,\" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said. The NFL had previously banned players from dropping to one knee, a practice started by Colin Kaepernick in 2016. Meanwhile, a large protest is expected in Washington DC on Saturday. The demonstration is the latest in a series against police brutality and racism that have been held across the US following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May. Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man in handcuffs, died after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer has been charged with murder while three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. On Friday, Minneapolis officials said police would be banned from using neck restraints and California pledged to follow suit. In a video, Mr Goodell denounced racism in the US in comments that came shortly after a number of players urged the NFL to take a stronger stance on racism and police brutality in the country. \"We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter. Protests around the country are emblematic of the centuries of silence, inequality and oppression of black players, coaches, fans and staff,\" he said. \"I will be reaching out to players who have raised their voices and others on how we can improve.\" President Donald Trump has stridently opposed kneeling during the national anthem, and on Friday again voiced his opposition to such protests, saying on Twitter: \"We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart. There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!\" He criticised New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees for dropping his opposition to NFL kneeling protests. Brees responded on Saturday by saying: \"We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial & prison reform.\" The practice of kneeling during the customary pre-game playing of the national anthem was started by black player Colin Kaepernick in 2016 in protest against racial injustice. A number of other players soon joined Kaepernick, who was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers at the time. He became a free agent after the 2016 season and remains unsigned. Kaepernick filed a grievance against NFL owners in October 2017, believing they were conspiring not to hire him because of his kneeling protests. The two sides resolved the grievance in February under a confidentiality agreement. On Friday, the Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights agreed to ban police neck restraints and chokeholds. The new policy, which will be enforceable in court, requires any officer regardless of rank to verbally and physically intervene if they witness a colleague using such unauthorised force. Meanwhile, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said he would move to end state police training in the use of the \"carotid restraint\". San Diego police banned the technique this week. Officials in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles have all previously taken steps to ban or limit the use of chokeholds by members of their police departments. Meanwhile, a federal judge in Denver has ordered police to stop the use of tear gas, plastic bullets and other non-lethal force on peaceful protesters. The order came after four protesters filed a lawsuit against aggressive police action.

The clashes in the centre of the capital, Rome, started after a fight between demonstrators, reports say. Police responded with water cannon and tear gas, and made several arrests. Hundreds marched to call on the government to resign over its handling of the crisis and the damage wrought on the economy and jobs. With more than 33,800 fatalities and 234,000 cases since the coronavirus outbreak began, Italy has been one of the hardest-hit countries in the world. The protesters gathered in the ancient area around the Circus Maximus. Clashes broke out as one of their representatives began talking to the media, reports say. Some demonstrators threw bottles, stones and smoke bombs towards the police, journalists and photographers, and shouted \"journalists, terrorists\", the AFP news agency reports. One protester said those attending were people who wanted to restore \"legality and dignity in Italy\". \"We are here to make the whole world understand that today in Italy, every category of workers is devastated and destroyed by a government that in fact is not doing the interests of Italians,\" he told Reuters news agency. Italy has entered its final phase in easing lockdown restrictions, allowing domestic travel between regions and opening its international borders. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said the government was working to speed up social payments and pledged \"a serious tax reform\". Shops, cafes and restaurants had already opened their doors again, and tourist sites have begun welcoming tourists in recent days."

        "text": "The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. He has been volunteering at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Prince William said he had been answering messages after being trained by the mental health charity. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: \"I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering.\" Those texting the round-the-clock service would not know they are talking to a member of the Royal Family - like Shout's 2,000 volunteers, William would use a pseudonym on the platform. Kensington Palace announced the prince's involvement to mark Volunteers Week, which ends on Sunday. A new photograph of the duke with Prince George and Princess Charlotte volunteering on the Sandringham Estate, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, has also been released. The Queen has praised the work of volunteers in a special message, saying: \"As Volunteers' Week draws to a close, it is inspiring to reflect on the many thousands of people, who through their acts of generosity and kindness, have achieved so much for the greater good. \"I have been following with interest how men and women from around the world, including my own family, have been helping and recognising the vital role of the volunteer. \"I send my best wishes to all those who give themselves so freely and selflessly in the service of others.\" The Cambridges and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex helped to launch Shout 85258 last year - investing \u00a33m in the service via their Royal Foundation. In a little over a year since then, more than 300,000 text conversations have been had on the service. Around 65% of those texting are aged under 25, the charity said, with many messengers seeking mental health support. By BBC journalist and Shout volunteer Tony Smith Training as a crisis volunteer at Shout puts William in the frontline of services for young people in distress - and it's a tough role. CVs, as they're known, undertake special training to support those in crisis. On the Shout platform they'll encounter, and be tasked with helping, those in very real distress. Some texters are experiencing depression or panic attacks, others are self-harming. A large proportion say they feel suicidal. The job of the CV is to lead that texter to a cool, calm place where they may begin to establish solutions. Sometimes they'll just need to build resilience, with support from friends or family. In others, they'll be guided toward charities or NHS mental health support. It's not unusual for a texter to be about to take his or her own life. This can lead to what Shout call an 'Active Rescue' - the CV will continue gently talking to the texter while the emergency services are called in by a supervisor. Whether it be talking someone down from a bridge, or persuading them to put away that bottle of pills, these conversations can be gruelling and rewarding in equal measure. The fact that the second in line to the throne is now routinely helping people in such desperate situations is hugely significant - it gives Prince William a unique perspective on what young people in crisis may be going through. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester have been calling people who are self-isolating or vulnerable, as part of the Royal Voluntary Service's NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The Countess of Wessex has also been privately volunteering to support efforts in local communities, including once a week with Mealforce and Helpforce, helping to provide daily meals for NHS workers across London. More than 750,000 people signed up to be part of the scheme's \"volunteer army\" after it launched in April, but some later expressed frustration at not having been used. Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge thanked others who had signed up to help the scheme, calling them \"the backbone of our country\". She and Prince William marked Volunteers Week by holding video calls with those helping charities in England and Wales. Among them were those working at Conscious Youth, which helps young people from mainly black and other ethnic minority backgrounds in West Yorkshire. During the call, Prince William joked about home-schooling his six-year-old son Prince George, saying: \"I struggle with Year 2 maths.\" The royal couple also spoke to a group of neighbours in mid-Wales who have been offering help with shopping, cooking and deliveries during lockdown. The prince told the 120 volunteers they had offered \"a lifeline\" to people in their community."

        "text": "A top guitarist and his new band have aimed to play the blues away during the coronavirus pandemic after moving in together before lockdown. Todd Sharpville, who has opened for acts such as BB King and Pink, decided to find a country house in Norfolk to hole up in when restrictions came in. He found a group of musicians who have worked with everyone from Paul McCartney to Amy Winehouse to join him. Sharpville said he was so busy was only getting three hours sleep a night. \"We are playing one to two streamed live shows a week and a lot of private performances as well,\" he said. Hundreds of people have been viewing his live streams, while some of his songs on his Facebook page have had more than 50,000 views. He has been in talks with a number of musicians about possible collaborations, including renowned British grime artist Stormzy. \"It is pretty much work around the clock. More work than before lockdown,\" Sharpville said. Sharpville, who has been a key part of the UK blues scene since the 1990s, paid for the musicians to be tested for Covid-19 before moving into the early 20th Century house near Sheringham. \"We are the only professional live band that has been locking down together in the world. And when you look at the cumulative names on everyone's CVs, band members have played with three ex-Beatles, two Rolling Stones, Eric Clapton, Amy Winehouse, Ed Sheeran and Adele - a lot of professional experience. \"Music is a form of therapy for [fans] and a vital necessity to hear the chemistry that comes from musicians interacting together and jamming together in the same room.\" Sharpville, who is the younger son of the third Viscount St Davids, said he felt the \"weight of ancestors on my shoulder wanting me to do something to contribute positively to the situation\". He said he had created a partnership with a music studio in Islington in north London, providing a band for musicians. \"A lot of named acts are involved. It would be great to work with people like Stormzy, where the music is more interesting, mixing different types of music,\" he said.

        "text": "In 2015, an unassuming-looking Bill Gates came on stage at the TED conference in Vancouver to issue a dire warning. \"If anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, it is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war,\" he told the audience. His prescient words picked up some coverage at the time, including from the BBC - but largely went unheeded. But now, the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times - with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself. Some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites. Others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world. Still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory, or even attempting to implant microchips into people. \"There are myriad conspiracies surrounding Bill Gates,\" said Rory Smith, from fact-checkers First Draft News. \"He is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies. And it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll - because he has always been the face of public health.\" Theories falsely linking Bill Gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 1.2 million times on television or social media between February and April, according to a study by The New York Times and Zignal Labs. Much of the content is posted to public Facebook groups, from where it is shared millions of times. First Draft News has also found that Chinese viral video site TikTok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones. So how did the founder of Microsoft, who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife Melinda, become the bogeyman of Covid-19 conspiracy theorists? Prof Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and author of books on conspiracy theories, believes it is simply because he is rich and famous. \"Conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things,\" he told the BBC. \"The theories are basically the same, just the names change. \"Before Bill Gates, it was George Soros and the Koch brothers and the Rothchilds and the Rockefellers.\" And while the majority of conspiracy theories \"die on the vine\", the ones that endure are those that offer \"big villains and address issues that people care about\". \"It should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear,\" he said. \"This has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long, long time.\" While he thinks such conspiracies have \"no tether to the truth whatsoever\", people still seem to be falling for them. More than a quarter of all Americans and 44% of Republicans believe that Bill Gates wants to use a Covid-19 vaccine to implant microchips under people's skin, according to a survey from Yahoo News and YouGov. Mr Smith thinks that there is often a \"kernel of truth\" which is taken \"way out of context\". So, for example, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation did fund a study, conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last year, which looked at the possibility of storing a patient's vaccination history in a pattern of dye. It would be invisible to the naked eye, and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine. It is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories - but it's thought the internet is making them spread further. \"Before the internet, they were self-contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities, but the internet allows them to travel across political lines, between communities, so I think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet,\" said Mr Smith. And, he added, conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were \"psychologically vulnerable\". \"This crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published. There are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty,\" he said. To deal with it, individuals resort to something he calls collective sense-making. \"We grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts. Conspiracy theories - and notably Bill Gates conspiracy theories - fill these informational vacuums.\" The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has committed $300m (\u00a3240m) to combat Covid-19, has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims. In a statement to the BBC it said: \"We're concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health. \"At a time like this, when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis, it's distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives. Right now, one the best things we can do to stop the spread of Covid-19 is spread the facts.\" In an interview with the BBC, Bill Gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories. \"It is troubling that there is so much craziness. When we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we don't have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people.\" I'm kind of surprised some of it is focused on me. We are just giving money away, we write the cheque.. and yes we do think about let's protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff. You almost have to laugh sometimes.\""

        "text": "TV presenter Kate Garraway has said it is \"a miracle\" her husband is still alive after his \"extraordinary battle\" with the \"evil\" coronavirus. Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain, Garraway confirmed her partner Derek Draper was put into an induced coma with the virus, nearly 10 weeks ago. The broadcaster said it had felt more like 10 years, but that she was \"grateful that he's still here\". She confirmed he is now free of the virus but in a critical condition. \"The fight with the virus has been won, but it's wreaked extraordinary damage to his body and we don't know if he can recover from that,\" she said. \"It's affected him from the top of his head to the tip of his toes.\" Garraway is the co-anchor of ITV's Good Morning Britain, as well as a presenter on Smooth Radio, while Draper is an author and former Labour political aide. She told the ITV programme she was putting on a brave face for the sake of their two young children, Darcey and Billy, and still enjoyed \"moments of joy\" and silliness with them, as her husband would have wanted. But she suffered a big emotional crash two weeks ago, as \"you can't stay like that forever\". \"I just have to think, I need to make them feel safe, they've lost for the time being - let's pray - their dad and he's their world, so they need to see that their mum is OK,\" said Garraway. \"The problem is I have huge hope and massive positivity and will never give up on that because Derek is the core of our lives, but at the same time I have absolute uncertainty,\" she added. The TV personality, who has appeared on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here and Strictly Come Dancing, added: \"And it's not just me by the way, it's his mum and dad and his sisters and everybody who loves him - all his friends, we're all going through that.\" \"And the doctors don't know because they've never seen this before. One doctor said to me that he's the worst-affected person that he's had to treat, who's lived. \"They talk about an evil virus, and it is.\" Garraway stressed she \"didn't want to scare people\", as the damage her husband has sustained is \"incredibly rare\". However, she noted how doctors and nurses - who she described as being \"extraordinary \"- were now starting to see \"completely unforeseen circumstances\" and consequences connected to the virus. \"This is a war Derek is fighting and tens of thousands of others\", she went on. \"It's an absolute miracle that he's here. \"I keep saying I know I've had a miracle but if I could just have one more, and he could just make that next step - I know I'm pushing my luck.\" Back at the end of March, she said herself and Draper thought he might be suffering with sinusitis, not coronavirus, because he had no persistent cough or temperature - two of the main official symptoms of the disease. He has no underlying health conditions. He soon developed a splitting headache and numbness in his right hand and began struggling to breathe. After consulting ITV's Dr Hilary Jones, Garraway decided to phone for an ambulance. Once in hospital he was eventually placed in a coma, at his own request, to give his lungs a rest, as he felt he was suffocating. He was only supposed to be in the coma for three to five days. Garraway revealed before he went under, her husband said: \"'You've saved my life'. I think he thought I persuaded the doctors to put him in the coma. But obviously I hadn't. \"He said, 'you've saved my life, and I don't just mean now, I mean everything. Being married to you and the children'. \"Then I said, 'I love you, I love you,' and the doctors said, 'he's gone, he's under,' and that was it - that was the last time I spoke to him.\" At one stage the medics described him as being \"off the scale with infection\", she said. \"It's incredible what they've done with a disease that nobody knows how to cure,\" added Garraway. While the doctors are still unable to say whether Draper will recover or not - or how soon - the presenter is certain that her family's life must now begin to return to normality. Billy will return to Year 6 of school next week while Darcey will have some intensive home-schooling with her mother as teacher. \"It's about really trying to carry on with life when you don't know life is certain,\" Garraway said. \"And I know that's what a lot of people are going through.\" Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "text": "When 11-year-old Carl returned to his primary school in south-east London this week almost everything had changed. He spoke to the BBC after lessons every day to paint a picture of a school in lockdown. I hadn't put on my uniform in months, and it felt strange. I couldn't wear my tie - the school said it was to avoid any infection from ties dragging across different surfaces. I could only take a bottle of water in with me and no bag. When we arrived at the school gates we had to queue 2m apart. My mum shouted \"Hi\" and \"Are you all right?\" to some of the other parents, but there was no chatting. Before I entered the school building, I had to wash my hands for 20 seconds. We all had our own desks and were sitting apart from everyone else. Once you had chosen your desk, that was yours until the end of term, you couldn't sit anywhere else. There were nine children in my class today, the maximum we can have in our class bubble is 10, and it was made up of a variety of students from different Year 6 classes. I had a different teacher and teaching assistant. They didn't wear masks, but kept their distance and stayed at the front of the class. At times they would say, \"Time for hand sanitising!\" The teachers have put up some rules showing what you should do inside the school building. One is that we have to follow a one-way system when we are walking around the school. To make sure we keep our distance, the teachers say \"Stretch out your arms,\" and if you are almost touching someone, you have to back up or go forwards. If we are going somewhere, you can only start walking when the person in front of you has taken three steps. We had Maths and English today and we ate our lunch in the classroom. When it came to outdoor play, the playground had been divided up into squares and you could choose three or four friends from your class to be in a square with you, while still social distancing. Once you had chosen, you would stay with the same people for outdoor play until the end of term. I looked at two of my friends. It took just one glance and we knew the three of us would be in a square together. Four Year 6 children from schools in England explain their feelings on going back to school, including their worry about spreading the virus, the difficulty of not being able to hug a friend and \"getting back into happiness\". When we used to play basketball on the court, we could pass the ball to each other with our hands. I miss that. In the square I was in today we had tennis balls and I could bowl the ball, but I'd have to go and pick it up myself, no-one could catch it. If you were in the square with the footballs, you could kick the ball to someone, but not touch the ball with your hands or tackle anyone. Four of my close friends have not returned to school. We had PE today and so I wore my PE kit to school this morning. It was colder on the way to school and I had goosebumps. Our teacher says the virus can stay on clothing, so we cannot change into our sports kit at school like we normally would. We wore it there and stayed in it until we went home. We were outside more today. We had science and we walked in a single line around the school grounds, always staying three steps behind someone, looking at the habitats of insects. In our PE lesson we had a competition between different groups, you all had your own tennis ball and one of the things we had to do was bowl the ball, and if you hit the wicket your group got a point. We also practised our fast footwork by weaving in and out of cones. My favourite lesson is Maths. I would like to be a computer engineer in the future. I usually go to Maths club after school on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but all clubs have been cancelled. I preferred what school was like before the lockdown, but I'm getting more used to the feel of how it is now. Even though you have to keep your distance from your friends, you can still chat to them, and we have invented what we call invisible high fives - it's like a normal high five, but into the air. We did two new subjects today - History and Art. In History we learnt all about the history of London. In Art we came up with ideas based on artist Barbara Hepworth's sculpture. My design was a leaf and in the middle was a hole where the sunlight pointed through. One of my friends didn't come to school today, so there were only two of us in our square for outdoor play. We're really good friends and I missed him, but I still had my other friend there. We don't see anyone else from the other classes during the day as they do different activities at different times and they enter and leave the school at different times too. I used to go to school and come home by myself, but with the new routine, my mum takes and collects me. She says it's like it was when I was back in Year 1. School finishes 30 minutes earlier than it did before the lockdown and mum says it's quieter at the school gates when she takes me and picks me up. Every year in summer we would have sports day and it was good because we got to do different competitions in different groups, but we won't have sports day this year. This is my last year at primary school. There would usually be a huge party for us at the end of term and we'd take part in Year 6 productions. It's a shame I won't get to experience these. Even though it's been different this week, it's been nice being back at school. We had Design and Technology today and learnt about mechanics, and we wrote a description of the main character in a book we have been reading called Rooftoppers. In PSHCE (Personal Social Health and Citizens Education), we learnt about the riots that have been happening in the US after the death of George Floyd. It was my turn in the football square on the field today, in outdoor play. It was good to be back playing football. My friend wasn't in school again, but he says he'll be back next week. Mum says the school set-up is beginning to feel more normal. She is really impressed at how the teachers always make sure everyone sticks to the social distancing. She is looking forward to when everything can go back to how it used to be, and being able to chat at the school gates again, but she says she knows it's going to take a while. We had a half day at school today. The teachers have said the school will be shut on Friday afternoons for a deep clean. We went into school in our PE kit again, like we did on Tuesday, but we didn't have PE - it's to give everyone an extra day for our uniforms to be washed. I'm looking forward to going back to school again on Monday. I'm also looking forward to secondary school in September. Mum says she's excited for my \"new adventure in Year 7\" too. She says she's really proud of me. My mum has a message for any other students who are planning to go back to school again for the first time next week. \"I know it's a bit scary for some people but just be open-minded and just look on the bright side,\" she says, \"and try to be calm and try to be positive.\" As told to Lucy Wallis.

The prettier the picture the better, no matter what laws/rules had to be broken to create it. The few people who are willing to voice their critical feedback are usually ignored, told they are just being negative, or that they need to stop policing \u201cart\u201d. . If you think adults deserve to be coddled, to have their hands held, or should be ignored when they repeatedly lie and break the law, there are plenty of accounts you can follow that conform to the status quo and take that approach. @publiclandshateyou isn\u2019t one of those accounts. I call it like I see it. Is the approach here salty, sarcastic, and snarky? Yes. Is it effective? Yes, I think it is. I understand that no one is perfect. People screw up. I screw up. And that\u2019s ok. Life is a learning process, however when the response to a harmful mistake is excuses, ignorance, and lying rather than learning and growth, there needs to be a level of accountability. Unfortunately, IG & FB have decided that preservation of our environment is not a priority and have chosen not to provide a way to report illegal/harmful actions on our public lands. That leaves it up to us, the peers of people who post harmful actions, to voice our opinions and make it known that we don\u2019t support illegal and harmful actions on our public lands. The goal isn\u2019t to bully, insult, or make people feel bad, but to show with polite and educational dialogue that we don\u2019t support illegal and harmful behavior on our public lands. The goal is to change the social norms around what is acceptable on our public lands, and that change requires a lot of voices. Change never happens by following the status quo. People have to get out there and stick their heads out. Is that going to make some people uncomfortable? Yes. But our public lands don\u2019t have their own voice, so that means people like you and I need to step up and be that voice, speak out for what we believe in. No one is going to do it for you and our public lands are not going to protect themselves. A post shared by  OUR PUBLIC LANDS HATE YOU (@publiclandshateyou) on May 15, 2019 at 6:21pm PDT End of Instagram post  by publiclandshateyou One man has made it his mission to stop bad behaviour by social media stars in national parks and public spaces. But not everyone's happy with his methods. \"There's a picture of me just a few months old and in a backpack, with my parents taking me for a hike through a national forest where I grew up,\" says Steve. \"And as I've grown, my love of the outdoors has grown.\" But also growing is Steve's frustration with influencers trampling over his beloved open spaces to get that perfect photograph. \"I drew the conclusion between the rise of this disrespect and the rise of Instagram and social media,\" he says, speaking to the BBC from a mostly rural area in the western US. \"So I decided to start an Instagram account, to fight fire with fire.\" Steve - we've agreed not to use his real name because of threats he's received - started an account called Public Lands Hate You in 2018. It wasn't long before it went viral. In early 2019, heavy rains came to southern California, including Walker Canyon, a chunk of public land an hour's drive east of Los Angeles. \"It was a wet year for us,\" recalls Brian Tisdale, mayor of the nearby city of Lake Elsinore. \"And when you get rain, it creates the perfect conditions.\" Perfect conditions, that is, for an explosion of wildflowers. \"It was a sea of orange. Just every hill was covered with flowers. It was absolutely stunning,\" says Mayor Tisdale.  \"People started pulling off the road to come and look at the flowers. \"It started this social media frenzy,\" he says. Download the Trending podcast from the BBC World Service The hashtag was #Superbloom. Attracted by social media - and old-school media as well - Walker Canyon became a tourist attraction, causing queues on the nearby highway and gridlock in Lake Elsinore itself. Influencers - and some unfamous social media users as well - took photos while trampling the flowers, going off the trail and picking the blooming poppies, all of which are against the park's rules. At one point, authorities were even forced to temporarily close Walker Canyon. The crowds kept coming until the flowers faded away into summer. The superbloom sent Steve's account viral. His fans sent in dozens of photos of people in Walker Canyon breaking the rules. He now has more than 75,000 followers - ironically making him something of an influencer himself. He's not alone. Other accounts do similar work - they have names like InstaWrecked, National Parks Hate You and Keeping Iceland Beautiful. Steve emphasises that he always tries to work with people rather than against them. He says he first tries to approach Instagrammers privately, to get them to add educational captions to their photos or take down particularly egregious shots. He has won some converts. Jae Fusz is an Instagrammer who flocked to another California superbloom this year - in Antelope Valley, north of LA. \"I was like, 'This is amazing. It's so pretty, like it was the best time ever,'\" he says. He posted a few shots on Instagram, including this one: California gurl \ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1 A post shared by  jaefusz (@jaefusz) on Apr 28, 2020 at 9:29am PDT End of Instagram post  by jaefusz The backlash was immediate. Steve got in touch in the comments section, calling him up on picking and walking over the flowers. Jae thought about it - and posted an apology. \"Each year hundreds of people come and destroy these flowers,\" he wrote. \"I'm posting this in hopes of educating the next person who goes to take photos near them and not trample over the flowers like I did.\" Not everyone is so accommodating. If Steve is blocked or ignored, he reposts the photo, and contacts companies who sponsor the offending Instagrammer. \"The most efficient tool in our fast-paced and ever-evolving social media culture is calling out illegal and harmful behaviour,\" he argues. And, unsurprisingly, that's earned him a few opponents. Ania Bonyetska works with her husband to post stunning images from all across the globe. She has over 100,000 Instagram followers. \"A lot of our work revolves around travel and taking photos in beautiful places,\" she explains. Walker Canyon's 2019 superbloom was, she says, a \"must see\". She visited and shared three posts including this one: They got the attention of Steve's fans. While Ania says she never got a message from him, Steve says he did try to get in touch. Ania's photo went up on Public Lands Hate You. \"As soon as they posted,\" Ania recalls, \"we got a flood of incoming hate.\" She is adamant she didn't do anything wrong, and she filed a copyright complaint to Instagram to get her photo taken down from Public Lands Hate You. \"As much as I agree with the underlying message, I don't think that they are effective,\" she contends. \"I think that they create insane division of opinions.\" Steve says he discourages harassment and tells his followers to stay respectful. But when it comes to his core mission, he's not backing down. His latest project is a \"bad influencer list\" - a roll call of repeat offenders. \"The idea is for it to be a resource to companies, as well as a deterrent to influencers who use our public lands in illegal and harmful ways,\" he says. \"Word is getting around in influencer circles that there's this grassroots group\u2026 who are fed up with their behaviour,\" he notes. \"The tide is still headed in the wrong direction, but it is starting to turn.\" Additional reporting by Mike Wendling Is there a story we should be investigating?

        "text": "The man suspected by German police of murdering missing British girl Madeleine McCann is currently in a German jail and has many previous convictions. German media name him as Christian B, 43. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed for privacy reasons. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, three, disappeared while on holiday in Portugal in 2007. He is serving a jail term in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, for drug-dealing, having been extradited from Portugal in July 2017. But there is also an ongoing case against him for rape. In December 2019, he was sentenced to seven years by a court in Braunschweig for raping a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005. That took place in Praia da Luz, only one-and-a-half years before Madeleine went missing in the same resort in 2007. He allegedly tied the woman up and gagged her, raped her in her bedroom and forced her to hand over cash. The rape conviction is, however, currently under review in the German courts, German n-tv news reports. There was a legal challenge over extradition technicalities in the case. German police say the suspect lived in Portugal's Algarve holiday area between 1995 and 2007, doing odd jobs, including as a waiter, but also burgling hotel rooms and holiday flats. A senior judicial source in Portugal has told the BBC the joint police investigation into Christian B began after a tip-off in Germany in 2017. The source said German investigators informed their Portuguese counterparts and British officials that they received a tip-off from a friend of Christian B, after the suspect had made a \"disturbing comment\" in a bar in Germany, as they were watching TV news coverage of the 10th anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance. Since that time, the official said Portuguese police have been making house-to-house enquiries speaking to those who knew him between 1996 and 2007. Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. German media say Christian B has also been investigated over the disappearance of a five-year-old German girl - named only as Inga. She went missing from a family party in Saxony-Anhalt on 2 May 2015 and has never been found. According to German official records, Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for theft, forgery, drug-dealing, firearms offences, rape and sexual abuse of children, public broadcaster WDR says. Born in Bavaria in 1977, he grew up in a children's home. In 1994, WDR reports, a court in W\u00fcrzburg gave him a two-year suspended jail sentence for sexually abusing a child. Christian B was 17 at the time. But in 1995 he moved to Portugal with his then girlfriend and began doing odd jobs on the south coast. They moved into a house together on the edge of Praia da Luz. At the time Madeleine disappeared the suspect was, police believe, living in a white VW Westfalia camper van with yellow skirting. Police are seeking any witnesses who remember seeing the van. German prosecutors have described the suspect as \"a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls\" and was \"serving a long sentence\". Police have released photos of two vehicles - the VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. Christian B received a phone call in Praia da Luz at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be \"critical\". Police have also released photographs of houses with which the suspect is believed to have been linked. It remains a \"missing persons\" investigation in the UK because the police do not have \"definitive evidence\" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not."

        "text": "There has been so much footage of the George Floyd protests swirling around on social media it's been hard to separate the real from the fake. We've selected some of the most widely shared misleading posts, images and videos from the past week. A photo of the US presidential residence apparently with all its lights off has been shared widely on Twitter, including by Hillary Clinton. Some people shared it to criticise Donald Trump's leadership during a time of crisis. However, a reverse image search reveals that the photo is old - taken in 2014 - and it's been edited to make it look like all the lights are off. The doctored version appeared in an article on the spoof news site News Thump in 2017 about Donald Trump turning off the lights to hide from FBI agents. \"Obviously the purpose of our photoshop wasn't to mislead, but to complement a joke we were making,\" says Richard Smith, managing editor of News Thump. It wasn't just the White House's lighting being debated this week, its Twitter account was also under scrutiny. On Wednesday the official White House Twitter account shared a video montage showing piles of bricks on the streets in different cities, and protesters throwing projectiles. The accompanying Tweet accused an anti-fascist group, Antifa, and \"professional anarchists\" of domestic terror through \"staging bricks and weapons to instigate violence\". It didn't provide any evidence to support this claim. Earlier in the week, we investigated some of the videos in the montage, and found that the bricks had been there before the protests started, often at construction projects in different cities. One recent video from Dallas of this type has been watched more than seven million times on Twitter. It shows a masked protester in front of some bricks saying, \"This is a set-up\", and that there is \"no construction\" nearby. Images shared by a local resident showed recent construction works in the area. Dallas City Hall also confirmed this to the BBC. On Facebook and Instagram there have been more than one million interactions with posts mentioning bricks and speculation about a set-up, part of a surge in social media posts discussing the protests. There have been more than 33 million Tweets mentioning either \"Blacklivesmatter\" or \"blacklivesmatters\" since 25 May, along with a deluge of videos documenting the protests, and police brutality. As we saw with those brick videos, rumours the protests were staged or set up have thrived online and they've also implicated the police. A video with three million views claimed to show police in Boston smashing up their own car. The narrator says \"they're going to blame it on the protesters\". However, another video of the same vehicle shows people kicking in the windscreen and jumping on the roof. Boston Police told a local TV station the car was already damaged when the police got there and officers were removing part of the windscreen to drive it away safely. Meanwhile, widely shared posts on Twitter have accused police officers of looting. Photos and videos show an officer loading trainer boxes into the boot of a car in Chicago. But Chicago police say the rumours are \"false\" and explain that the officer was helping the victim of a burglary nearby, and the images show the detective helping to load goods into the shop owner's car. The shop has confirmed that the video shows police returning looted goods. We've seen lots of examples of old videos re-shared without clear labelling. A video of an African-American man pleading with people not to destroy his business has been widely shared on TikTok. The posts imply it's from the recent protests, but the video is actually from 1992. He says: \"It's not right, I came from the ghetto too. Same as all of you did.\" The initial post was captioned \"open yalls eyes it's not a protest no more\" without any reference to it being from an old protest. The clip has been viewed more than five million times, shared more than 160,000 times and has amassed more than 20,000 comments. The footage was actually taken at the LA riots in 1992, following the acquittal of police officers who beat Rodney King in 1991. There have been lots of genuine conversations about Black Lives Matter happening on social media this week. With so much activity online, though, come misleading claims, suspicious activity and conspiracies. Bad information in this setting can cause confusion, stoke tensions and distract from factually correct information. In many ways these protests, happening against the backdrop of a global pandemic, are the perfect breeding ground for misinformation.

        "text": "Ally. All lives matter. White privilege. These are just a few of the words and phrases you may have seen or heard in discussions about racial inequality after the death of George Floyd. Many of these terms about race and activism are controversial  - and people often have different ideas about what certain phrases mean. Their life experiences will also affect how they define them. So Radio 1 Newsbeat's been chatting with a couple of people for their interpretations and perspectives. Kehinde Andrews is professor of black studies at Birmingham City University, director of the Centre for Critical Social Research, founder of the Organisation of Black Unity, and co-chair of the Black Studies Association. JT Flowers is a 26-year-old American rapper, student and activist living in the UK. White privilege - a term some find upsetting and offensive - refers to the concept that people have basic rights and benefits simply because they are white. It doesn't mean they haven't suffered hardship or that they don't have a tough life - just that their colour hasn't made it harder. JT feels some people get defensive about this term because it's misunderstood. \"You might be a white person and still be poor with a lack of access to education or face a language barrier in the workplace. It doesn't mean you can't be disadvantaged in other ways,\" he tells Newsbeat. \"It just means with respect to that one particular thing - your race and skin colour - you do have the luxury of not being able to think about it. \"It means having the luxury of being able to step outside without fearing that you're going to be discriminated against or oppressed in any way because of the colour of your skin,\" he says. The most recent statistics from the Home Office and Ministry of Justice show: Kehinde believes the benefits of whiteness can be \"psychological\" and that \"there is a benefit to being white because you're not treated in the same way.\" \"There are different dimensions to it, some people have more privilege.\" Kehinde tells us the phrase \"white privilege\" was first written by the famous black civil rights activist William Du Bois in the 1930s to explain the way white workers in America benefited from segregation and the colour of their skin. Content is not available Many argue black people have to deal with an extra burden of worrying about how they will be treated because of how people perceive them. Speaking in a special show on BBC Radio 1Xtra, DJ Ace said as a \"huge black man with a beard\" people find him \"frightening\". \"I have to live with this all day, every day and in every scenario. \"I'm aware my aesthetic is scary to some white people. Sometimes I might 'tone it down' and that embarrasses me\". \"If I see a white woman coming down the street I might cross so she feels more comfortable.\" White saviour is usually used to describe somebody who appears to think certain communities '\"need saving\". \"It is a concept that's rooted in this idea that marginalised communities, particularly the black community, isn't empowered enough to liberate themselves,\" says JT. He says in online spaces and activism it's usually used to point out when someone \"takes it upon themselves to speak on behalf of black people or marginalised people,\" sometimes without understanding the circumstances. JT says ideally people should \"create space for black people to speak for themselves\". Last year, Stacey Dooley was criticised for making a film in Uganda for Comic Relief, and posting a picture on Instagram of her with a black child. At the time, MP David Lammy said: \"The world does not need any more white saviours\". Stacey Dooley insisted there was \"nothing sinister\" about what she did - and has since said she wouldn't change what she did. Following the row, Comic Relief's co-founder, the writer and director Richard Curtis, said the charity would use fewer celebrities in their films and be \"very careful to give voices to people\" who live in the areas being highlighted. At first glance, this seems a contradiction to \"white saviour\". JT describes an ally as \"a person who's willing to stick their neck out and stand up for what's right when they see something going wrong\". Often, this is someone who is outside of the community they are trying to help - so in this case, it might be white people who want to support the black community. \"It's what can white people do?\" says Kehinde. JT believes an ally needs to do more than act like a \"white saviour\" and \"take on some risk and bear the cost of actually standing up for justice\". \"What we're trying to do in the States is push the dialogue to a place where people begin to consider what it would look like to be an accomplice. He believes the best way to be an accomplice is to \"create space for black people to speak for themselves.\" All Lives Matter This is often used as a response to the phrase \"black lives matter' - the feeling from some people that all lives should be included in the conversation around race. JT believes people who say it may not understand what the \"black lives matter\" phrase means. \"Imagine your house is on fire and somebody comes up to you and says, 'Hey all houses matter.' \"Your response would be along the lines of, 'Yes but your house isn't on fire so if all houses matter and your house is fine, then why is it so much to ask you to care when my house is burning down?'\" JT believes we live in a society where - at present, \"black lives aren't valued in the same way that white lives are.\" Silence = Violence Again a controversial phrase which basically means the best way to address an issue is to speak about it - and staying quiet means you agree with what's going on. \"It's effectively just the idea that the status quo, our everyday reality at present, is a violent one for black people,\" claims JT. \"Refusing or failing to speak out on that is to be ok with things as they are. \"You don't have to post something on social media in order to act and live your life in an anti-racist way. If you see something going wrong on a street, you can speak up and do something.\" JT realises many people can feel uncomfortable on speaking out or may feel it's not their place. \"If you notice that you feel unequipped to have conversations with people about race, you can take the time to educate yourself. And speaking out doesn't have to mean posting on social media it can simply be about starting to talk honestly about race with those closest to you. \"You can have conversations with your friends and family members.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

        "text": "My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Alex Wright from Leicester takes us through a week in his life during the coronavirus pandemic. Alex, 29, is a venue manager of a gaming arcade and earns \u00a325,000 a year. However, he has been placed on furlough since March. His partner Rebekah is an NHS nurse and has recently started maternity leave following the birth of their twin daughters, Eden and Indie, last week. They have two older boys, Rory, five and Casper, four. Over to Alex.... The day starts at 7:00 with the newborn twins needing a feed. They came home yesterday after being at the hospital for the past few days and are on a feeding plan to help them gain weight as they were born nearly five weeks early, which means they will need formula in addition to breast milk. We never intended to use formula as breast milk is a lot cheaper! But when it comes to health, there is no discussion needed. We've had a new Tesco open close by so I take a walk to see if the formula is in stock and how much it costs, whilst also taking the opportunity to use their coffee machine! They have the formula but it's slightly more expensive than our usual shop so I do not purchase it. I do pick up a coffee, a Red Bull, a couple of croissants for our other two children and some bacon for \u00a37.85. 12:30. We have a visit from the community midwife to see the twins. Everything is ok and both gained some weight! Going to come back again in two days to make sure all ok. Rest of the day is spent tidying. Our house with six in has suddenly gotten a whole lot messier! The twins are settling in and getting used to the new noisier surroundings generated by their older brothers. I purchase the formula from Sainsbury's where it is \u00a310.50. Total spend: \u00a318.35 7:00. I check my bank account and see the direct debit for the gas and electricity has been taken today (\u00a342.84). We're using slightly less than this so the account is now \u00a35.86 in credit. Usually I would be at work now but being on furlough is a strange situation, I've never not been at work since turning 18. The time at home is great, even more so since the twins' arrival, but it does feel like something is missing, let alone \u00a3200 less in my pay. To help with this, we have taken the option of a mortgage holiday which is saving us \u00a3627 a month. 11:30. We take a walk to the park for a picnic with a detour to the shop for supplies (\u00a319.95). I always make sure I scan my Nectar card app as my points balance is worth over \u00a355. Hoping to have this close to \u00a3100 in time for Christmas. 16:00. I plan to laminate the hallway but when I start I realise I've lost my hammer. I rip out the old skirting board and clean up before going to buy a new one. It's Casper's birthday on Friday and Rebekah asks me to pick up some things for his party so with these, a new hammer, some other bits and a couple of new t-shirts, I've spent \u00a354.81. When I return I tell her to never send me shopping again on my own, I always seem to buy more than intended! Total spend: \u00a3117.60 11:00. The community midwife arrives and Indie has gained a lot of weight but Eden is still the same. We're advised to keep to the feeding plan and she will return to check again on Friday. 13:30. During lockdown, we decluttered and listed a few items on eBay. A Nintendo Wii sells for \u00a336, so Rory and I take a walk to the post o\ufb03ce. We nip into the shop \ufb01rst for a drink and a sneaky chocolate bar (\u00a32.10). I tell him that he's not to tell his brother or mum! Postage and packaging costs \u00a314.49 and it's on its way to its new owners. 17:00. I'm informed I will be returning to work on 8 June. This is a surprise as I wasn't expecting to be back till July but the arcade I manage is being classed as a non-essential shop. I have mixed emotions, probably more so because of the surprise at being allowed to open. I pass the message on to my team who, reassuringly, respond with excitement. 17:30. I don't usually drink alcohol at home but seeing friends having drinks tempts me. \u00a318.80 and a case of beers later and drinks for Rebekah and the boys, we're out in the garden. Total spend: \u00a335.39 Total made: \u00a336.00 10:00. I have a busy day planned today. I agreed to help my mum's partner by moving a load of mixed concrete for him from a wagon. When I finish, there's a KFC close by which doesn't look busy so I pop by and have a \ufb01llet stacker meal which is \u00a36.59. 16:00. On to the next job \ufb01nishing the laminate \ufb02ooring at home. Some di\ufb03cult cuts to do round the stairs, doorway and piping but the job is complete and I'm happy with how it has turned out. 18:00. Need to pick up party food for Casper's birthday tomorrow. I can't remember the last time I \ufb01lled the car up and it comes to \u00a358.14, usually this would cost close to \u00a370 every couple of weeks so love the low oil prices! Then to the supermarket where I spend \u00a3161.53 on food, tableware, party supplies and some tiny baby clothes as the girls are not \ufb01tting their up to one-month out\ufb01ts. I spend the rest of the evening building a go-kart whilst my partner wraps the presents we've been hiding in the wardrobe. Total spend: \u00a3226.26 It's party day! Casper is turning four today and what a strange time to be in! It would have been his \ufb01rst real party with pre-school friends but sadly, not going to be the case. To try and make the day special, we found a bouncy castle company still operating and ordered one for the garden. 7:00. No surprise with the early start, the birthday boy jumps on to our bed super excited. Whilst this blog is about money, there is nothing quite as valuable as seeing that excited smile on your child's face. 8:00. The bouncy castle arrives and is in\ufb02ated. They disinfect the castle prior to leaving and we pay them \u00a355 for the day. The boys waste no time in jumping on! 11:00. The community midwife arrives to weigh the twins again. Both have put on weight, enough for no further additional visits, with the next being at 21 days. 11:30. So throughout the day, lots of text messages and phone calls arranging times for visitors to bring presents for Casper whilst complying with social distancing measures. Certainly a different type of party than we're used to. However all is worth it, especially when the birthday boy says it's the best birthday ever. 20:00. After a tiring day, a Chinese has been ordered (21.80). No way either of us are cooking tonight. Total spend: \u00a376.80 More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: 12:15. As I am soon returning to work, I draft up some rotas ready for the reopening. It will be strange going back after so long and still so many questions. Will we be busy? How will customers react to the changes? And most importantly, will my team and myself stay safe? 13:30. A further DIY task, today the glamorous job of sealing a toilet base. Two young boys tend to \"miss\". However, all doesn't go to plan as one of the screws is damaged. After an hour of trying to remove, I begrudgingly order a screw extractor and some screws for click and collect which comes to \u00a311.57. Get home but still no luck. I clean as much of the area and scrub underneath as much as I can then seal the base. Disappointed at a job half done and wasted money. 18:30. The day is wrapped up with a conference call to discuss fundraising ideas for Lutterworth Town FC, who I am the club secretary for, and a night on the sofa in front of the telly. Total spend: \u00a311.57 A quick look at today's forecast, another hot day on the cards so we decide to have a barbecue. 12:30. Off to the supermarket to pick up some coal, drinks and food to cook and prepare. \u00a343.60 spent and plenty to enjoy. 14:00. The BBQ is going well, sun is shining and the boys are playing nicely together and the girls have been sleeping most of the time. 20:00. So after a relaxing chilled out day, me and Rebekah talk about the crazy week we've had. This coming week we need to decide what to do as we have the option of sending Rory back to school from 8 June. It seems like everything is going back to normal. Total spend: \u00a343.60 This week was by no means a normal week! Normally we would have done a weekly shop, maybe filled the car with fuel, made another couple of trips to the shop and spent around \u00a3150-\u00a3200. Being on furlough, and I'm sure others can relate, has left me a lot of newfound free time. I feel this has assisted in making the weekly spend creep up to help the days go by. I don't know how I would class myself with spending. On the one hand, I always look for the cheapest deals and have no problem in not buying something there and then because it's the easy option. But on the other hand, I do tend to put a few non-essential items in the basket. This My Money exercise has certainly opened my eyes to what I actually do spend. However, despite spending almost double on our usual week, this week has created memories to last a lifetime and you just can't put a price on that! We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you."

        "text": "As cases of Covid-19 start to fall across Europe, lockdowns are being relaxed and more travel is being permitted. That's a relief for alpine tourist resorts, which were forced to close down right in the middle of the ski season. This weekend Switzerland's mountain railways and cable cars can start running again. In Grindelwald, home of the Eiger and the world famous Jungfrau \"top of Europe\" railway - altitude 3,454m (11.332ft) - this is very good news. The Konzett family have been running the Kreuz and Post hotel in Grindelwald for four generations. When the Swiss government declared a state of emergency in March, ordering the closure of schools, restaurants, bars and all the ski slopes, their business melted away. \"It was a big shock,\" says hotel manager Benjamin Konzett. \"The bookings we had\u2026 we lost them within one day, basically.\" \"We've had this hotel since 1886, and to find a similar situation to now, we would have to go back to the Second World War, when everything was closed.\" Grindelwald's director of tourism, Bruno Hauswirth, believes the re-opening of the mountain railways is the key to bringing tourists back. After all, more than a million people took the train up to the Jungfrau last year alone. But how to ensure the visitors, eager to wonder at the north face of the Eiger, or get within touching distance of the glaciers, stay safe in the rack railways or cable cars taking them up there? The Swiss government's advice on maintaining a two-metre distance from others still stands. Kathrin Naegeli of Jungfrau Railways admits there are no plans to reduce occupancy. \"Everybody who wants to board a train can board a train,\" she explains. \"But, we say, if you can't keep the distance of two metres you should wear a mask. We hope people will take them with them but we will also sell them at the stations, and our people working in the trains will all wear masks as well.\" These are the same measures put in place across Swiss public transport with one slight difference. On Switzerland's high-speed intercity trains you cannot open the windows. On the mountain railways, and in the cable cars, you can. Nevertheless, the alpine communities know there will be questions about the safety of crowded cable cars. Popular ski resorts like Ischgl in Austria and Verbier in Switzerland are believed to have had high infection rates in February and March. As skiers returned home, they carried the virus across Europe. So alarmed were doctors in Verbier that they asked the government to quarantine the entire town. By that time, however, Switzerland was already locking down. No-one really knows yet how the normally crowded apr\u00e8s-ski bars and discos will function in winter. As for the ski lifts, Kathrin Naegeli says \"we will see in summer and autumn how things work in the trains and the cable cars, and perhaps we will adapt for winter\". When the Alps first became a popular holiday destination in the 19th Century, their natural beauty and clean environment were key attractions. UK tour operator Thomas Cook at the time marketed villages like Grindelwald as places where minds and bodies could recuperate. The Konzett family hotel opened in 1886 to cater for people wanting a healthy break away from the crowded, smoky cities. Now Benjamin Konzett is returning to that concept. The pandemic, he says, allowed him to spend more time appreciating the environment he grew up in. \"During the lockdown everything was fresh with spring, the mountain tops were still covered with snow, and we used the time to go back to nature a bit with the family.\" He has even, he explains, been preparing some alpine delicacies for the longed-for summer guests. \"I collected cowslips and elderflowers to make ice cream for the summer.\" Now he hopes tourists will forget about their winter pandemic worries and choose the Alps to recover from the stress and fear of the last three months. \"The whole world meditated during this lockdown and we found out that nature is stronger than mankind.\" But the Alps will face fierce competition from Greek islands and Spanish beaches. Tourist resorts across Europe are all trying to salvage at least something from the summer season. In Grindelwald, where over 30% of guests come from Asia, Bruno Hauswirth knows this summer won't be as good as the last few years. \"But that means nearly 70% come from Europe, so we are quite confident,\" he says. The three-month lockdown gave Grindelwald a chance to reflect on exactly where its strengths lay, he believes: real mountains like the Eiger along with \"very intact nature, perfect air and clean water\"."

        "text": "Solidarity protests against the death of George Floyd in the US are continuing to take place in the UK despite the Home Secretary Priti Patel and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to take to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about whether people can protest or not. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a \"gathering\" as a meeting involving \"social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity\". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the spread of the virus. \"There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen\", says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It \"risks spreading the virus and that risks lives\". Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before the death of Mr Floyd, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go to their own homes. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at \u00a3100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan, from London's Garden Court Chambers, explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and also to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. \"So it becomes a balancing exercise,\" she says. \"If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate. \"But, this is where the context of where we are right now becomes important. \"We are not on the first day of the lockdown. It's very clear that you are allowed outside, and to gather, although only in groups of six.\" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. \"You can see there are people in small groups in parks. It's very difficult to argue they are not all in the park for the same purpose. So if we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people, as well as those in the park.\" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. Chief constables today talk about their public duty to \"facilitate\" demonstrations - and that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they believe they are going to have to quell trouble. And it seems pretty clear that the police don't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. Speaking on LBC radio on 6 June she said that: \"Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you.\" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make \"a case-by-case decision\" as to what was the right thing to do. The National Police Chiefs Council have also issued a very strong and unusual statement in the hope of calming tensions. They said they are appalled by Mr Floyd's death in Minnesota and know people want to make their voices heard. \"The right to lawful protest is a key part of any democracy, which UK police uphold and facilitate,\" the statement added. It pointed out that with gatherings of more than six people outdoors still restricted, \"we ask that people continue to work with officers at this challenging time\"."

        "text": "People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with an easier one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. You should also: Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.

        "text": "There have been almost 290,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 40,000 people have lost their lives, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests deaths had reached more than 48,000 by 22 May. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number by this time of year, the toll rises to almost 62,000 by the same date. Some of these deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Coronavirus accounted for about 21% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 22 May, according to death registration data. In the week to 17 April, when deaths from the virus reached their peak, this figure was just under 40%.

Enter a UK postcode, English, Welsh or Northern Irish council name, or Scottish health board name to find out If you can't see the look-up click here. The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world. However, the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons. On Sunday, the government announced a further 77 deaths. Although there tend to be fewer deaths reported at weekends, this is the lowest number of daily deaths reported since lockdown began. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with more than 36,000 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. In Scotland, the official government figure for deaths is 2,415, but data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests it had reached nearly 4,000 by 31 May. In Wales, the death toll stands at 1,398 while there have been 537 deaths in Northern Ireland. There were no new deaths reported in Scotland or Northern Ireland on Sunday. This is the first time since the beginning of the pandemic that Scotland has recorded no new deaths and only the second time in Northern Ireland. Although officials have cautioned against reading too much into the figures, because of the lag in reporting deaths at weekends. This week's figures from the ONS show the overall death total in the UK for the week to 22 May had fallen, but was still above normal for the time of year. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has found that people from ethnic minorities have a disproportionately higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did not look at occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with NHS England figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. About 25% of all coronavirus related deaths have been among care home residents, according to the ONS, but the latest data suggests that has now stabilised. The \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. That estimate is the same for Scotland and Northern Ireland, while it is between 0.7 and 1.0 in England and Wales. However, new research produced by PHE and Cambridge University's MRC Biostatistics Unit suggests the R number has increased across England in recent weeks. The model found it is highly likely that R remains below 1 in most regions, but said it is at 1 in the South West and just above 1 in the North West. Dr Yvonne Doyle, Public Health England's medical director, said an increase was \"to be expected as we gradually move out of lockdown.\" Sage's estimate for the UK figure is based on several different models, including those produced by PHE and Cambridge. Each uses different methods and assumptions and gives a different set of regional values for R. The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. The number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in April, despite an increase in the number of tests being carried out, and the seven-day rolling average shows a clear downward trend. A further 1,326 cases were announced on Sunday. However, estimates by the ONS suggest there could be nearly 6,000 cases per day in England alone - not including cases in hospitals or care homes - where people either show no symptoms or have mild symptoms and are not tested for the virus. Cases were originally concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but Wales and parts of the North East have also had a high proportions of cases. Going forward, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the possibility that there could be \"local lockdowns\" to control the spread of the virus. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has been gradually declining since a peak over Easter. On Friday, the government said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus had fallen to 7,080 - down 15% from the same time last week. However, the picture is different across the UK's nations and regions, with numbers falling faster in some areas than others. The UK has exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May, the government has said. However, the UK Statistics Authority has criticised how the data has been presented, saying the aim appears to be to show \"the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Mr Hancock says he is looking at ways the information could be \"improved\". There were 141,123 tests in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Sunday, according to government figures."

        "text": "As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people. This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: \"Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. \"And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid.\" Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies. How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including: But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events. \"If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,\" Dr Kucharski says. \"If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission.\" Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: \"We found that many of the settings are what we expected. \"So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. \"And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases.\" But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms. All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time. But Dr Knight says there is another common thread. \"These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,\" she says. \"There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky. \"There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. \"So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example.\" Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: \"Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection. \"So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors. \"Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible. \"Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk.\" Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says. Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus. But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed, Dr Cevik says: \"We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. \"But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. \"And that's huge.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

        "text": "Face coverings are to become compulsory for people using public transport in England from Monday 15 June. Also, all hospital visitors and outpatients will have to wear face coverings and all staff will have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. Face coverings are already recommended in some enclosed spaces - like public transport and shops - when social distancing isn't possible. The move to compulsory face coverings on buses, trains, ferries and planes, and the new rules for hospitals, will coincide with a further easing of lockdown restrictions. From 15 June, ministers want more non-essential retailers to open and some secondary school pupils to return to classes. This could put more pressure on public transport, and make social distancing more difficult. The government has stressed that people should: Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said passengers should wear \"the kind of face covering you can easily make at home\". Surgical masks should be kept for medical uses. He told BBC News that while scientists aren't in full agreement about face coverings, \"we think it's worth doing absolutely everything possible\" to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Mr Shapps said it would be a \"condition of travel\" to wear a face covering and people could be refused travel - and even fined - if they didn't follow the rules. He said British Transport Police would enforce the regulation if necessary - but he hoped most travellers would comply. Details of the rules will be displayed at stations. Transport staff will also wear face coverings, and volunteer marshals, known as \"journey makers\", will give advice. Until now the government advice in England has said you should wear face coverings: It also stresses that personal face coverings: In Scotland, it is recommended that you consider using face coverings in limited circumstances - such as public transport - as a precautionary measure. In Northern Ireland, people should have face coverings in enclosed spaces for short periods of time, where social distancing is not possible. Currently, the Welsh government does not ask for people to wear non-clinical face coverings - saying it is a \"matter of personal choice\". The World Health Organization (WHO) has updated its guidelines on wearing face masks, previously only recommending them for people who are sick and showing symptoms and those caring for people suspected to have coronavirus. It now recommends that non-medical face coverings should be worn on public transport and in some enclosed work environments. It also advises that healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care. People over 60 and those with underlying health conditions, the WHO says, should wear medical masks when social distancing cannot be achieved. Homemade cloth face-coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances - they might help stop the spread of coronavirus by people who are contagious but have no symptoms (known as asymptomatic transmission). Scientists in Singapore suggest that risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease. Coronavirus is spread by droplets that can spray into the air when those infected talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. Although there is a risk of self-contamination from wearing face coverings, when taking them on and off, and that they may give a person a false sense of security. The most protective mask is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. NHS staff in lower-risk situations can wear a surgical mask. This includes healthcare workers within one metre of a patient with possible or confirmed Covid-19. These staff may be in hospitals, primary care, ambulance trusts, community care settings and care homes. From 15 June, all hospital staff in England will be required to wear surgical masks under all circumstances. Members of the public attending hospital will be strongly urged to wear a face covering (although no one will be denied care and face masks will be provided by the hospital if necessary) There is lots of advice online about how to make them. Suggestions include using common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding. The government has published advice on how to wear and make your own cloth face covering which says:"

        "text": "Lockdown restrictions are gradually being eased across the UK, but the rules are different in each of the four nations. So, what sports can you play and who can you meet? The overall advice remains \"stay at home\" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. However, small-sided or full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, if social distancing guidelines are followed, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. More than two people can now meet outside across the UK: In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. Children are included in the headcount for groups meeting in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales, two large families can meet - as long as each of them lives at a single address. And remember, social distancing guidelines - with people from different households remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - still apply across the whole of the UK. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible for many people who want to see their friends and family. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: \"It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet.\" Overnight stays are also still not permitted. Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, said: \"If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way.\" The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. The rules in Wales so far say you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not \"an invitation to go into a garden, have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people\". People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if you do go out, take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household. There is another group of about 2.5 million people, categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. These include people who have had organ transplants, cancer patients and those with severe respiratory conditions. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called \"shielding\". Now people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Despite the easing of lockdown restrictions across the UK, scientists stress the need for people from different households to remain 2m (6ft) apart. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. This coronavirus appears to thrive in crowded, indoor spaces which is why pubs, restaurants and many workplaces remain closed and the public has been advised against using public transport. But virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should stay at home and not leave it for any reason. This is known as self-isolation. You should not leave your property even to buy food or medicine, and instead order these online, or ask someone to drop them off at your home. If the NHS Test and Trace team in England gets in touch because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will have to self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but they must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

        "text": "Lockdown restrictions have started to be eased across the UK, but there are still limits on what we are able to do. BBC News answers some of your questions on what it all means. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you don\u2019t have to go into quarantine if you\u2019re returning to the UK from what\u2019s known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the \"Dublin dodge\") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you. However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands. Key workers are exempt from having to quarantine - as long as they are not displaying symptoms of coronavirus. The government has published an extensive list of who is exempt from quarantine. Among others, it includes people working in healthcare and seasonal agricultural workers. The list details what you\u2019ll need to show when you return to the UK, to prove your key worker status. This differs between categories but typically it would include proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work you\u2019ll be doing. Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford\u2019s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home. For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many \"silent spreaders\" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that \"there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics\". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, \"perhaps a lot of cases\". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many \"silent carriers\" there may be. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. All personal protective equipment (PPE) worn during the highest-risk situations - such as aprons, gloves and surgical masks - should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. However, guidelines now say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed in these \"exceptional circumstances\". But doctors and nurses are not happy with this situation. The Royal College of Nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if adequate PPE has not been provided. If you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. \"If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,\" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. \"Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.\" Starting a new relationship is difficult during the current crisis, but not impossible. It is possible now to meet someone from another household, alone or in the company of others, outdoors  - either in a public place, or in a back garden. On the other hand, intimacy and privacy may be more of a problem. People are still being advised to maintain a distance of 2m from anyone not in their household, and it is still not permitted under lockdown regulations to meet someone from another household indoors, either at your home or theirs. And taking the relationship to a more intimate level is not permitted either. The latest amendment to lockdown regulations states that \u201cno person may, without reasonable excuse, stay overnight at any place other than the place where they are living\u201d. There are exemptions to this rule, but none of them include romance. It\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK\u2019s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will \"remain unprecedented\" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to \"long waiters\", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre-Covid-19 levels\u201d. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that \"infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Primary schools in England are starting to reopen from 1 June, depending on the number - pupils in Reception and Years 1 and 6 are among the first to return. It's expected that about half of the children entitled to return will do so. At present, it is not compulsory for parents to send their children to school, and there will be no fines for non-attendance. However, the government says that eligible children are \"strongly encouraged\" to attend. It is expected that this temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - will continue for all parents of any year groups going back in England during the summer term. There are currently no plans for schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland to reopen before the end of the summer term. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are \"no restrictions\" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: \"Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes.\" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may \"vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe\", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. It depends on a number of factors. \"Typical\" business trips to Germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out \"essential functions\" such as healthcare. A certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case. With the introduction of quarantine restrictions at UK borders from 8 June, returning to the UK will not as straightforward. Anyone entering the UK from that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. There are a number of exemptions to this rule, including UK residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work. Legally, no, you are not. Being in a private car with someone from another household might not be classed as outdoors, and meeting someone from another household \u201cindoors\u201d is against the law. The law in England and Northern Ireland only allows more than two people from different households, up to a maximum of six, to meet outside. In Scotland, eight people can meet outside, but they can only be from two households. In Wales, two households of any number of people can meet outside. You also cannot get a taxi to bring your relative over to your home, as cabs may only be taken for \u201cessential\u201d purposes. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. If you\u2019re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of \u00a37,500. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months (\u00a36,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job \"absolutely cannot be done from home\". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. In the case of small and medium-sized employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days. Eligible employees are entitled to \u00a395.85 a week. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can\u2019t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth \u00a395.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it\u2019s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: \"We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,\" he said. \"So we are talking about really large numbers of people.\" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who\u2019s leading the Church\u2019s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. No.The Department of Health says the service will begin tracking those who tested positive in England on Wednesday and going forward. Anyone who tested positive before that should already be self-isolating for at least seven days, with other members of their household self-isolating for 14 days You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage. Yes, people who have previously tested positive will be asked to self-isolate again. That's because there are still a number of uncertainties about whether having coronavirus gives you immunity, or whether people with immunity can transmit the illness to others. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who tested positive for the virus in March, told LBC Radio that he would have to isolate if he was approached by a contact tracer. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. What questions do you have about coronavirus? Do you want to ask it on BBC News?

        "text": "People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. The NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. An app is also being developed, although its launch has been delayed. The hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead. Anyone in England with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No-one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Manual tracing was meant to be launched in mid-May, in tandem with an app that would automatically alert users if they have been in contact with another user with coronavirus. The manual element launched in England on 28 May.  The app is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight and hasn't been released more widely, although business minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested it would be in place by the end of June. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, with 700 contract tracers at the moment - increasing to 2,000 later. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop the danger of the virus spreading. You should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine and live alone, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. If you live with other people they won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. Not enough people with coronavirus symptoms are ordering a test, says Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading England's track and trace system. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England's tracing system would be \"world-beating\". But a report from Channel 4 News said in the first few days of operation only a small number of contacts had been traced. It's understood that between 28-30 May, just over 1,800 coronavirus sufferers had registered contacts online or by phone - and of the 4,600 people they'd been close to, only 1,750 were contacted by tracers. On 3 June, the government said it would be providing weekly updates ''shortly''. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says ''thousands of people are being contacted'' and that the government won't publish details until the statistics authority is happy about how they are measured. The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. It's currently voluntary, but the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply \"we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house\". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a395.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions. Some have expressed fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will keep working."

        "text": "Secondary school pupils are due to return on 15 June, following the partial reopening of primary schools in England at the start of the month. Meanwhile Wales has announced a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen for Years 10 and 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time. Students will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. Nursery and pre-school children plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 were the first to go back in England, from 1 June. Head teachers reported \"highly variable\" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%. Not all schools reopened and some local councils issued their own advice to head teachers. Schools have been open throughout lockdown for priority pupils - vulnerable children and those of critical workers - across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June to all age groups - but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Plans in England include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could be different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is \"very, very small, but not zero\", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools are not ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales and Scotland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England and Wales, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?

        "text": "The government has come under pressure from MPs and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing, to make it easier for people to return to work. But scientists continue to question whether that would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread. The simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization says that a distance of 1m is safe. Some countries have adopted this guidance, while others, including the UK, have gone further: Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. In a study published in the medical journal The Lancet, scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread. They conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission. But some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If that is the case, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Professor Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out at hospitals in China, which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But for the US Centers for Disease Control, the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is \"currently uncertain\". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. There is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19, following up the contacts of the people infected. They estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside. In many countries, including England and Scotland, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and \"enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible\". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions. It will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried, and how viable it remains, which will all take time."

        "text": "The NHS has listed three main symptoms of coronavirus, that people should be aware of and ready to act upon. If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus. Follow James on Twitter.

        "text": "The government says it can now test 200,000 people a day for coronavirus. It aims to process tests within 24 hours by the end of June. The tests are seen as vital to controlling Covid-19 as the lockdown eases. In England and Wales anyone with symptoms can get a swab test. In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff. Couriers collect samples and take them to laboratories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June, except where there were difficulties with the post. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of the Test and Trace service, has said 84% of drive-in centre tests come back within a day. No figure has been provided for home kits. Speed is important because delays give the virus more time to spread. Scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said false negative results range between \"two and 20-odd percent\". The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, has called NHS staff to be tested more than once. Testing is essential if contact-tracing systems now in place across the UK are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. Tests can also help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. They can also let the health service plan for extra demand and inform government decisions around social distancing. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On Sunday, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing \"the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test doesn't work. A government spokesperson said it was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to \"increase transparency\". There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

        "text": "A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK will be enforced from Monday. More than 200 travel companies have asked for the new rules to be scrapped and some MPs have also voiced concerns. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move would protect public health, now that imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined \u00a3100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to \u00a31,000 if they fail to self-isolate. Passengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. Once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Employers should agree future working arrangements with staff before they travel overseas. Employees who can't work from home are eligible for statutory sick pay if they meet the required conditions. Anyone arriving from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man does not have to enter quarantine. The government has also said it is looking into ''international travel corridors'' between the UK and countries with low infection rates and strong healthcare systems. It hopes this could avoid the need for quarantine for travellers between the two. Portugal's foreign minister told the BBC he hoped an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. However, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end. The measures will be reviewed in late June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''. There are a number of groups who are exempt, including: Travellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Fourteen-day quarantine rules apply in destinations including Italy, Greece, Canada, the UAE, Australia and New Zealand. Many have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. In Spain, only UK citizens with permanent resident status can enter. From 1 July, Spain will allow some travellers in without quarantining, but this doesn't include the UK. Airlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine \"would effectively kill off air travel\". The British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them \"overzealous\". Virgin Atlantic will restart a handful of routes from 20th July, with more to follow in August. EasyJet will restart a ''small number'' of flights on 15 June, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks. Ryanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports. British Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the new quarantine rules.

The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? Are you planning to travel to or from the UK?

        "text": "Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a \"dangerous moment\" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. \"It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,\" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at \"Level 4\" rather than \"Level 3\" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is \"not a lot of room\" for manoeuvre and the data \"urges caution\". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and \"we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate\". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those \"following the science\". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. \"Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,\" argued Prof Calum Semple. Major deja vu feeling to mid March. Scientists incredibly concerned, politicians ignoring this, public doesn't want life disturbed. End of Twitter post  by @devisridhar There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a \"second wave\". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. \"With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,\" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: \"I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. \"It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.\" Follow James on Twitter"

        "text": "The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are \"far from complete and comprehensible\". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had \"temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. \"People tested\" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with \"void\" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one \"person tested\" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a \"small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test\", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was \"just not happening\". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as \"smoke and mirrors\". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to \"show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the \"people tested\" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the \"people tested\" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as \"people tested\" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed \"to avoid confusion\". Follow Rachel on Twitter"

        "text": "Outdoor markets and car showrooms have been able to open again in England from Monday as the government eases its restrictions on some retail sites classed as \"non-essential\". So, what can customers expect and what is the timetable for the reopening of other types of outlets? Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. But now that list has grown in England. From Monday, open air markets and car showrooms have been allowed to reopen. The government says they must meet the Covid-19 secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. It says, as with garden centres (which reopened in England on 13 May), the risk of transmission of the virus \"is lower in these outdoor and more open spaces\". One car dealership is trusting customers to take test drives alone. The National Association of British Markets Authorities chief executive, David Preston, though expects a lot of older stallholders will not return because of virus fears. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland on Monday, prompting long queues. Hundreds of people starting queueing hours before the stores opened as Ikea asked them to come prepared with ready-made shopping lists and their own bags. From 15 June, non-essential stores in England will be able to reopen. This includes shops selling things like clothes, toys, books and electronics, as well as tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets. Among department stores, John Lewis will open 13 branches initially, while Next will only reopen 25 of its 500 stores on 15 June. Primark will keep its 190 shops closed until it is \"convinced that it is safe and right\" to open them. No dates have been set for the reopening of shops in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but each country has plans in place. Smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in Scotland in phase two of its lockdown easing plan. In Wales, non-essential shops and services could happen in the amber phase of its exit strategy. Non-food retail outlets can reopen in step two of Northern Ireland's plan. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone, if they can, and talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited and shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimates that the current lockdown is costing non-essential retailers \u00a31.8bn a week in lost sales, and it does not expect that to pick up immediately shops reopen. \"Evidence from other countries suggests that, despite an initial bounce in spending in the weeks after restrictions are lifted, discretionary spend is likely to remain subdued as the coronavirus pandemic wears on,\" said the BRC's Kyle Monk. The British Independent Retailers Association's chief executive, Andrew Goodacre, believes fewer people than before will go shopping and they may \"soon become weary of queuing\". He told the BBC: \"Social distancing also takes away the fun and positive experience of shopping. All these factors mean that it will be difficult at first, and for many months after.\" Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest, if they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection falls. Hospitality firms and some other small businesses may have to wait longer to reopen. And Mike Cherry, national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, wants the government to \"provide those firms some idea of when they'll be able to get back to work\". He added: \"High Streets up and down the country have been largely empty for months now, and while more businesses in England may be able to open up soon, there may well be not enough custom to justify the financial and health costs. \"Until people feel safe enough to spend, small businesses face a long struggle back to steady ground.\""

        "text": "The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone \"we're all going to wash our hands once an hour\". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says \"wash your hands\". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."

        "text": "The government has told schools to reopen for certain year groups from 1 June. But what does it mean in practical terms for schools - and how are they getting ready? We spoke to one head teacher to find out. \"It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are green.\" That is how Debbie Whiting, head teacher of North Denes Primary School in Norfolk, describes the task in front of her - remodelling her school during a pandemic so that three classes can return next month. \"The more you look at things, the more there is to think about,\" she says. Classrooms have been stripped out, new signage put up around the school and year groups divided into small \"bubbles\" to keep pupils away from each other and - it is hoped - minimise the risk of coronavirus spreading. The school in Great Yarmouth already knows it will not be ready to reopen for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes on 1 June, and is instead working to a deadline of 8 June. This summer the school should have been preparing to move into its new \u00a39m buildings, but construction delays mean all focus is now on making the existing school safe for returning pupils. \"The 1 June date might be convenient for being after half-term but it's not given us anything like the time we need to put things in place,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"It's really difficult. You just keep thinking, have we caught everything?\" Parents have been asked whether they will send their children back - but only half have responded, making planning difficult. So far, one-third of those who have replied say their children will return. Mrs Whiting estimates she can make her plans work if about 40% of the 180 children return. If they all came back, she would need an extra 12 classrooms at the school. The school hopes to make social distancing as natural as possible for children by breaking classes into smaller \"bubbles\" of about seven pupils and two teachers. But without knowing the intentions of the other families, the plans could be useless. Mrs Whiting has left the decision up to parents, but wrote to them recently to warn them \"school will be a very different place\". \"Until we have those numbers, planning to keep everyone safe in bubbles is really tricky,\" she said. \"My concern is that they've heard that schools are reopening and on 1 June they just arrive.\" For the rest of term, all school life will take place within the bubbles. In those groups pupils will learn, eat and play, with each bubble using a nominated classroom and set of toilets to prevent cross-infection. Children will not be allowed to take bags to school, and will work in a new exercise book and their teacher will not take them home to mark. Uniform policy will be scrapped as children will need to wear clean clothes every day \"and many will have outgrown it anyway\". \"If they've got different clothes on every day you'll know that they've actually changed,\" said Mrs Whiting. The school has gained experience from teaching the children of key workers over the past weeks, and the numbers have steadily risen from eight pupils to 20. \"Parents will expect us to social-distance their children, and we intend to do that,\" says Mrs Whiting. The school day will be re-organised, with staggered starts and a lunchtime finish once children have been given their food. In the morning, children in each bubble will arrive at 15-minute intervals, and line up in the playground two metres (6ft 6ins) apart before being led into their classrooms. Only one parent will be allowed to drop off and collect each child, with no gathering by the school gates, though Mrs Whiting acknowledges getting several children to school at different times is \"likely to cause problems\" in single-parent households. Bubbles will be kept separate at break times and when they are given lunch, with each being given their own area of the playground to use. Even before coronavirus, the school was without its kitchen because of building works, and could only use half of its main hall. Pupils' movements around the school will be restricted mainly to their bubbles, but the way they use the communal areas will change. Each year will have a separate entrance to the buildings, and school corridors will operate a one-way system so people can maintain their distance. Doors will be left propped open and handles cleaned regularly. \"It's about controlling all movement,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"We also started careful hand washing before the lockdown and the children have been pretty good at that.\" Hand dryers in the toilets have been switched off on official advice, and replaced with paper towels, while the school has ordered pedal bins for every classroom so that PPE - which will be used for first aid or personal care - can be disposed of safely and without contact. Classrooms will also look different, with the need for distancing reducing capacity to about eight desks. All rooms have now been decluttered and non-essential items removed, filling the school's storage spaces. In the younger age groups' classrooms, soft furnishings, rugs and toys have been removed - anything remaining will have to be washed at the end of each day. Cleaning routines have been stepped up and surfaces will be disinfected regularly. Pupils will be asked to bring their own stationery, and forbidden from sharing. In a letter to parents, Mrs Whiting had previously warned \"there is no such thing as social distancing in a school - we can try but we certainly cannot guarantee it\". The logistics of preparing the school come on top of the everyday challenges of leading a school in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country. \"The government line is to get children in school so that they don't fall behind, and in disadvantaged areas that is important,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"But a lot of those who want to return are not those who are in that group.\" The Department for Education says it wants children back in schools \"for their education and wellbeing\", and the phased return is based on scientific and medical advice. For head teachers, the last few weeks have been \"wearing\", says Mrs Whiting, as they juggle pressures from government, parents who want their children to be kept at home, and those who want them back at school. Underpinning all the preparations, her focus has been on keeping the children as safe as possible. \"This is something I've never ever had to deal with,\" she said. \"And you do wonder what happens if someone gets it and, heaven forbid, there's a fatality? \"But I can't hold myself responsible for that, because I'm not the one who is asking them to come back.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"

        "text": "Some children in England will be going back to school from Monday 1 June. Following a heated debate, the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus. Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus. Across the UK, 0.01% of deaths were people under 15, 1% were aged 15-44 and about 75% were over 75. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 as at 15 May, and half were younger, according to a research charity. But the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40. Children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases, according to Prof Adilia Warris, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Exeter. They often have \"milder disease than adults,\" she says, pointing out that deaths have been rare. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads. It is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is - at any age. To understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population, and work out how they might have caught it. A University College London review of the evidence, based on studies using contact tracing and population screening, suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the \"balance of evidence\" suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and, if they do catch it, less likely to pass it on. But the \"evidence remains inconclusive,\" it said. One study looking at cases in Shenzhen in China at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus, raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms. But research carried out since then has been more reassuring. Studies of clusters of infections in family groups across China have concluded - based on contact tracing - that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children. A study of a cluster of infections in the French Alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms. Community studies in Iceland, South Korea, the Netherlands and  Italy all found evidence children were less likely to have - or have had - the virus than adults. The Italian region studied tested 70% of its population. A review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded: \"The role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households.\" One theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells. But experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this. More children in schools means more teachers working, and more parents at the school gates, and it's not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection. As the Sage report says, \"It is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff, parents, and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school.\" The group of scientists modelled nine different \"return to school\" scenarios. On 16 May, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the R number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading - while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school. It was reported that in 22 European Union countries where schools were partially reopened, there hadn't been a significant increase in cases, including among staff. These countries all opened up schools to different extents. France did report a small uptick in cases after partially re-opening schools. But World Health Organization (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan agrees that children are \"less capable\" of spreading the virus, and are at \"very low risk\" of getting ill from the disease. \"What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.\" Government guidelines say it wants to start with Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children in England because: The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen to Year 10 and Year 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time The schools minister Nick Gibbs told MPs there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in England back before the summer break."

        "text": "Around 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home. This \"shielding\" is to protect lives. While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves. The guidance on shielding is being kept under review as the UK moves out of lockdown. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from Monday 1 June, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. Other parts of the UK have not yet recommended the same, but Northern Ireland may make the move on 8 June. Those most at risk, who include: While it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, over half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. Over 90,000 are children. Anyone in this highest risk category who has not yet received a letter from the NHS or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online. This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing. Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations. You could call your doctor to discuss this. It means staying at home and following the guidelines. You should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors. Visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water. They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you. They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing. They should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window. If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels. If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too. Keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails. Communities Minister Robert Jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs. The Treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is \"more tailored to individuals' needs\". In England, people have been asked to shield until the end of June and this date will be reviewed. In Wales, it's 16 August, in Scotland it's 18 June and in Northern Ireland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to. The ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. A vaccine could help towards this. These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading: Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible. Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online. Prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas. You can register for support with food, shopping and deliveries and additional care. Over two million food boxes have been delivered in England since the programme started."

        "text": "The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met? \"We will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day\" - Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 18 March Outcome: On the same day a press release from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) gave more details of the tests to diagnose coronavirus and said \"the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks\". But the government did not hit 25,000 tests a day by mid-April. Only 18,665 tests were conducted in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) on 15 April. In terms of testing capacity - the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day - that stood at more than 30,000 by mid-April. \"I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month\" - Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 2 April Outcome: On 1 May, the government said it had reached the target and announced 122,347 tests for the last day of the month (30 April). The testing figure had been averaging about 20,000 a day but increased significantly in the last days of April. When home testing kits were introduced in large numbers towards the end of the month, DHSC began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesn't mean the test was actually used by someone on that day. Previously, only instances in which the testing swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. The 122,347 figure included about 40,000 kits sent out to homes and test centres. In a letter to Mr Hancock on 2 June, Sir David Norgrove, chair of statistical watchdog the UK Statistics Authority, was critical of this methodology. \"The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding,\" he wrote. Prof John Newton, who leads the government's testing programme, said on 1 May: \"That's the way they are counted, have always been counted, and the way we were advised to count them by officials.\" In May, using that methodology, the government hit its target 18 times and missed it 13 times. The devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing. But Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5,000 tests a day by mid-April, blaming problems obtaining testing kits. Likewise, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 April that Scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10,000 tests per day by the end of April, saying \"we are working towards a capacity of 3,500 by the end of April\". The Scottish Government announced at the beginning of May that it had reached this reduced target. \"The ambition, clearly, is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month, and then to go even higher\" - Boris Johnson in Parliament 6 May There had been some confusion as to whether the target for testing by the end of May was 200,000 tests conducted or a capacity to do this many tests. Matt Hancock eventually clarified that it would be the capacity for tests, and that it would include antibody tests (which establish whether somebody previously had the virus) and tests being sent out to a random cross-section of society by statisticians, as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms. On 30 May, the DHSC announced that the UK had hit the target, with labs able to process 205,634 tests a day. This included capacity to do 40,000 antibody tests a day. On 31 May, they carried out 23,000 antibody tests. When it comes to number of people actually tested for coronavirus on a daily basis, the government has not released this figure since 22 May. The DHSC says the number has been \"temporarily paused.\" \"We are working with Boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of April\" - Matt Hancock statement, 4 April Outcome: DHSC told the BBC on 4 May that 49 regional test centres were operational across the country. Mr Hancock had previously said in a statement that there would be \"over 50\" by the end of April. The \"drive-through\" test centres are run by Boots and other commercial providers. DHSC also said that 96 mobile testing sites were in service by 4 May. \"By mid May, we'll have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place\" - Matt Hancock, 1 May Outcome: On 1 May, Mr Hancock said that the government's testing programme was the \"first element\" in the wider strategy to \"test, track and trace\". He added that an \"initial 18,000\" contact tracing staff would be in place \"by mid-May\". Their role is to identify individuals that have Covid-19 and then to \"track and trace\" anyone they've recently been in contact with. Those individuals can then get themselves tested. On 18 May, Mr Hancock told Parliament that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited in England, of whom 7,500 were healthcare professionals. And on 20 May, Mr Johnson told Parliament, \"already we have recruited 24,000 trackers - by 1 June we will have 25,000.\" \"I have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will help us very greatly to defeat this disease.\" On 1 June, Matt Hancock said that the contact tracers had been working since Thursday 28 May, but would not give figures for how many people they had contacted. \"On the personal protective equipment, the answer is by the end of this week.\" - Boris Johnson, 25 March Outcome: On 25 March, Mr Johnson was asked in parliament when \"every single person\" working in care homes around the country would receive the personal protective equipment (PPE) they needed. He said it would happen by the end of that week. However, that didn't appear to happen. In early April, Nadra Ahmed, from the National Care Association, said, \"The issue we hear most is, 'I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.' Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\" According to those working in the care home sector, the situation improved later in April but was not resolved. Martin Green from Care England said on 20 April that \"access to PPE remains problematic\" and that care homes still need \"a consistent supply\". The DHSC says that from 25 February to 27 May over 1.51 billion items of PPE have been delivered across the health and social care system in England (it hasn't given a figure for care homes). This includes: It has been counting gloves individually so this last figure would be over 451m if counted as pairs. Concerns about the availability of PPE in care homes have also been raised in Scotland and Wales. \"Making sure that the NHS always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical\" - Matt Hancock, 17 April Outcome: The government has met its objective. By 18 May, the last day the figures were published, the proportion of critical care beds occupied by Covid-19 patients had fallen to 20% in England, 17% in Wales, 10% in Scotland and 15% in Northern Ireland. The spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for the virus. The government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment. \"Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks\" - Matt Hancock, 5 April Outcome: The DHSC told the BBC that, by 5 May, the government had managed to make 10,900 mechanical ventilators available to the NHS across the UK. Mr Hancock's 18,000 target was for this type of ventilator, according to the DHSC. The original UK target had been higher but was reduced, Mr Hancock said, because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for the DHSC said: \"Every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one. We continue to keep capacity ahead of demand.\" This article was updated to reflect the latest figures on testing and contact tracers. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "text": "About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated \u00a310bn to the economy. Ceremonies this year have been devastated by coronavirus, but Northern Ireland will allow small outdoors weddings from Monday. There is no official word yet about the rest of the UK. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to take place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland has allowed weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have been granted emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment\", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act\", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to \u00a330,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."

        "text": "Lockdown measures are starting to be eased after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England, you can now meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households - for example in parks or private gardens - as long as you follow the guidance and remain 2m (6ft) apart. In Scotland, eight people from two different households can now meet up outdoors if you maintain social distancing. Groups cannot be bigger than eight, and people are \"strongly recommended\" not to meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors. Each household should follow social distancing rules. Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although outdoor weddings with 10 people present may be allowed from 8 June. In all four nations the headcount regarding permitted numbers of people includes children. The overall advice remains \"stay at home\" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. There is no longer any limit to the amount of time you can spend outside doing exercise in England. People can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Permitted individual sports vary by country. Tennis, can be played in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, where the rules are different. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. Wales and Scotland are encouraging households to stay local and not travel more than five miles if possible. But 11 Conservative MPs have called on Welsh ministers to explain the \"scientific basis\" behind the decision to remain close to home. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed that hotels and tourist accommodation can reopen on 20 July. Most people will, yes. As of 8 June, most people entering the UK - including British citizens - will have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so \"for the foreseeable future\". But the government says those who can't, should travel to their workplace if it is open - and walk, cycle or drive if at all possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport. Read the government advice in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Those who do use buses or trains are being told to expect social-distance queuing wile wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now spend some time outdoors again. It means those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can go outdoors from Monday 8 June. In Scotland, \"adjustments\" are anticipated in the coming weeks to the shielding guidelines. House moves and viewings can resume again in England. Potential buyers and renters will be able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. During lockdown, registered childminders were either closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. From 15 June in England, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their \"continued remote, home learning\". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. The university watchdog says new students must be told with \"absolute clarity\" how they will be taught before accepting a place. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are \"Covid-secure\". Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. In England, places of worship can reopen for private prayer from June 15, the government is set to announce - although not for services or events. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

        "text": "Bosses who have furloughed staff during the coronavirus crisis will have to start paying a share of the government scheme from August. The furlough scheme is designed to help people put on leave due to the coronavirus outbreak, and to prevent employers having to make mass redundancies. So how does it work and who is eligible? The government is currently paying the wages of more than a quarter of UK jobs through its furlough programme - the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It puts workers on leave and allows them to stay on the payroll. About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed since March, with the government paying 80% of their salaries up to \u00a32,500 a month. Companies can top up this pay if they choose and must let employees know they have been furloughed. The scheme - backdated to 1 March - opened to applications on 20 April. By the end of May \u00a315bn of claims had been made. It will run until the end of October and is expected to end up costing about \u00a380bn. On 29 May, Mr Sunak announced two changes. From 1 July, businesses can bring furloughed employees back to workplaces part-time, a month earlier than previously announced. It will be down to individual firms to decide what part-time means and pay the wages for that time. They will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work. For example, Mr Sunak said an employer could bring someone back to work two days a week. In that situation, the employer would pay for those days, while the furlough scheme would cover the employee for the other three working days. From 1 August, employers will have to pay national insurance and pension contributions. Furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay. In September, employers will then pay 10% of employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at \u00a32,500 per employee per month before tax, or \u00a3576.92 a week. If employees are not paid set amounts each month - for example if they have returned from maternity leave, or receive top-up pay - you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built in to an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. All the money claimed must be paid to your workers, or to cover their national insurance and pension payments, even if a firm is in administration. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank account, if you are eligible. Claims take about six working days to process. Potentially yes, if your company can't give you work to do because of the coronavirus outbreak. The scheme covers those who were on an employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. This includes full-time and part-time workers, and employees on flexible, zero-hour or agency contracts. You must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and you can be furloughed more than once. If you have been made redundant since 19 March, your former employer can re-hire you under the scheme. But newly hired employees are not eligible. Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than \u00a350,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500. Anyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding for health reasons or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage. If you are placed on furlough you can't do any work for your employer. This will change from July onwards when the government says furloughed workers can return on a part-time basis. You can volunteer in the community or even for your company as long as you aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. From July to October, you may be able to work part time, and be furloughed for the remainder of your hours. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to \u00a32,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. Companies don't have to keep on any employees when furlough ends, and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages. The hope is that by the time the scheme ends, restrictions will have lifted and businesses can start paying full salaries again."

        "text": "The self-employed are receiving government support to cover some of the losses they face as businesses struggle in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Ultimately, it may not be as generous as the scheme for furloughed workers, but it will now extend into the summer, following the latest announcement from Chancellor Rishi Sunak. If they have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant is being paid to the self-employed or partnerships, worth 80% of their profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month. It is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year but who confirm business has been hit by coronavirus. Initially, this was for three months in one lump-sum payment. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment, the chancellor has said, which will cover 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months, so \u00a36,570 in total. This will again be made as a lump sum direct into bank accounts. More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The scheme has been open to those with a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Those who are recently self-employed, having set up since April 2019, will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because they will not have filed a tax return and therefore HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will not know of their self-employed status. Self-employed people can apply for the first grant until 13 July, and the second from August - at a date to be set. They do not need to have received the first to apply for the second. The government's help comes on top of a six-month delay for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Those with the lowest incomes are in line to receive more generous benefits payments, announced previously. The chancellor said those applying for universal credit should be paid within a few days. The chancellor said this will cover 95% of the self-employed who make most of their money from self-employment. This is how it works: Those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will have 80% of their salary covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if operating through PAYE. There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of \u00a3781 a month. The number has risen fast since the financial crash of a decade ago. About 3.8 million of them may be covered by this scheme. So far, 2.3 million self-employed have signed up to grants totalling \u00a36.8bn. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education. The chancellor also suggested tax breaks for the self-employed, such as lower national insurance may end in the future. These were in place because, for example, the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay, and to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of the self-employed with employees. A plan had already been announced for those who are employed. The government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). These was backdated to March and the scheme has been extended to October. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment. Employers will have to make a contribution to these payments from the summer. The self-employment support package is slightly less generous, but the Treasury says this is because, unlike salaried worker, self-employed people are still free to operate if work is available."

        "text": "A professional rugby union team that set off for an away match on 23 February have still not made it home. Manuma Samoa left their Pacific island for an away match in Perth, Australia, more than 100 days ago. But on their way home they were forced to quarantine in New Zealand - and were then stuck when their home country closed its borders entirely. In Auckland, the squad lived in a church compound for three months, with 20 players sharing one room. Although they are now back in Samoa, they are halfway through a two-week quarantine - and players still haven't seen their families. \"When we arrived in New Zealand it was summer,\" the team's video analyst Hari Junior Narayan tells the BBC. \"When we left it was winter.\" Manuma Samoa's first game of the Global Rapid Rugby season was on 14 March, so the team left Samoa on 23 February. They had a two-week training camp in Auckland, played the game in Perth, then planned to fly home via Auckland, in time to prepare for a home match in Apia on 21 March. But while the team were playing in Perth, the Samoan government made an announcement. From 08:00 on 15 March, the government said, anyone travelling to Samoa from one of 33 countries must spend two weeks in self-quarantine before setting off. Australia was country 33 on the list. The squad were allowed to enter New Zealand, and the Auckland compound where they held their pre-match training camp was still available. But that's where their good luck ended. On 24 March, the Samoan government announced that, from 26 March, \"all international travel to and from Samoa by plane is ceased\". The team could not leave quarantine until 30 March. They were stuck. At the compound, 20 players stayed in single beds in one large room, while the management stayed in smaller rooms. \"We had no privacy or anything like that,\" says Theodore McFarland, who stands six feet six inches tall. \"There were a few guys snoring.\" But despite the snoring, he says, spirits stayed high. The squad played bingo most evenings - with stakes of 50 cents or $1 - cooked outside in Samoan \"umus\" (stone ovens), and kept fit. They turned their living room into a gym, and, thanks to a quirk in the rules, were allowed to train outside - even after New Zealand went into Level 4 lockdown on 25 March. \"After lockdown, the police came to break up our game of touch [rugby],\" says video analyst Narayan. \"It wasn't a great look from the outside - but we were within our bubble.\" New Zealand's Level 4 rules said exercise had to be \"solitary - or with those you live with\". The officers, standing outside the locked gates, let the housemates play on. Despite living cheek by jowl, Narayan insists there were no arguments between the players. \"Probably the biggest disagreement was at bingo,\" he says, laughing. \"Money was involved so no-one wanted to lose.\" And - in what may be surprising news to British rugby players - the squad stayed off the beer, despite being locked down for so long. \"We're not allowed drinks, or any of that,\" says McFarland. \"It's part of our rugby culture - especially as we were staying in a church compound.\" After New Zealand's lockdown eased in late April, a handful of the squad who lived locally were allowed to leave, but the Samoan-based players remained stuck. The bingo and the umus continued, yet the day-to-day monotony wasn't easy on the squad's mental health. \"We were in a compound, you see the same people every day,\" says team manager Tuala Pat Leota. \"I imagine this is what a prisoner feels like.\" To make this worse, glimmers of hope would arrive, only to be snuffed out. \"They [the authorities] kept pushing it back,\" says Leota. \"At the start, they said maybe April [for a flight home], then they pushed it back to 19 May, then 22 May, then to 29 May.\" Finally, a week ago, the players were able to leave the Papatoetoe compound. But the waiting wasn't over - Samoa is one of the few countries without a virus case, and they are not taking chances. So, after the players landed on home soil, they were put in quarantine for two weeks. The players and management are staying in separate, isolated locations. Leota and Narayan are together in a hotel, for example, but McFarland is on his own. Suddenly, the compound in Auckland doesn't seem so bad. \"We were like a family there,\" says McFarland. \"I think that made it easier for us, but now I've got no-one! Now I wake up and\u2026it feels crazy, it's just me.\" So he's missing the 50 cent bingo? \"Definitely,\" he replies. Leota also says there were positives to emerge from their epic journey home. \"To me,\" he says, \"the friendship and companionship with the players and management is something very positive to come out of this not ideal situation.\" Thankfully, a journey that began 104 days ago is almost over. In a week's time, the squad will taste freedom, and see their families for the first time since February. \"My daughter is four months old,\" says Narayan. \"The last time I saw her, she was one month, so I've missed a lot.\" That game in Perth on 14 March - which the Samoans lost - must seem like a long time ago? \"Sometimes,\" he replies, \"we forget we even played a game.\""

        "text": "For many of us, our homes have become our workplaces over the past few months, and a full return to the office still appears a remote prospect. Major tech companies say they are open to their staff working from home permanently. Employees are coming to realise remote working is not only possible but, in some cases, preferable. A shift to a new way of working might already be under way. Such a shift could have profound implications on our home life, and by extension on the life of our towns and cities: almost a quarter of all office space in England and Wales is in central London alone. To understand those implications, we brought together four experts on city life, all of whom were working from home. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography, London School of Economics: I do think we'll go back to offices but not in the same way. People are more productive when they are closer together with face-to-face contact. There's 20 years of really good persuasive research demonstrating how important that is. There are lots of things you cannot do except with other people - people are innately social animals. Les Back, professor of sociology, Goldsmiths: I do think we are at a tipping point. There's a reorientation, a recalibration of the relationship between place and time and social life that we're on the cusp of. We may see profound changes. Some things may not come back. Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research, Royal Town Planning Institute: It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever. Twitter said it. Facebook said it. The CEO of Barclays said that putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past. The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways. Les Back: The hollowing-out of city life has been coming for a long time. It may be that what will happen is that some businesses won't come back to the centre of the city and think it's too risky - or there may be other economic drivers where people will just take the opportunity to ask: \"Why are we investing so much of our capital in these large office spaces?\" I think there are possibly huge effects [of more working from home]. There's the pressure on the domestic sphere. There's the pressure on gendered relationships at home, on the blurring and overlaying of parenting and work and the pressures that would cause. Aude Bicquelet-Lock: I think what we will see is that local centres may see more diversification - more dining, more social activities as people may want to meet each other. Also working from home may mean getting access to workplaces in local towns for some days. Growth is to be expected in these areas. The contrary could apply to bigger cities, which of course raises the question of how the office space could be reused: there are several options, like turning offices into residential spaces, which hasn't always been done with absolute success. I also wonder whether we will need conference halls and other meeting spaces as we did in the past. Paul Cheshire: You will get more people working from home, which will mean there will be more demand for large houses. You have to have a workspace, which will push you out. You may need to move to commute maybe once a week, twice a week to your headquarters, wherever that is, for meetings. Therefore you'll accept a longer commute for cheaper space. You'll tend to move further away from the city centre. On the other hand, there will be people who have to stay in the offices, stay in the concentration, the social interaction, who will become even more strongly attracted to the city centre. But you will probably also get localised desk-sharing, specialised areas where people can go if you're a homeworker, where you can occasionally get better IT or better facilities or get away from your children. There will be an opening-up in smaller towns of hot-desking spaces. We will need more space. What you would be doing is opening land close to stations with good access to city centres. You could build a million houses on green belt land within 45 minutes of central London because there's so much green belt land. The fastest-growing places for people commuting to London are incredibly far away - Peterborough, York, Somerset. People are living miles out in order to get affordable land and more space. That will be accelerated. And it will be particularly accelerated unless we are willing to release land close to transport nodes that will give access to jobs. Margaret Bell, professor of transport and the environment, University of Newcastle: Our research has shown that in a study of commuting to Newcastle the 7% of trips over 50km were responsible for 60% of the carbon emissions. The further you travel, the more detrimental effect with emissions. Paul Cheshire: That's one of the ironies of the green belt: forcing people to commute further. Margaret Bell: My worry is people buying more cars and those who have cars will use them more. What we do need is incentives to use bicycles more and to get people to shift towards living closer to their work or workplaces, or arranging for people to go to work more locally. We need a bottom-up approach to understand people's needs and try and tailor the transport accordingly. Paul Cheshire: Housing, particularly in England, is very energy inefficient. There's quite a big carbon footprint with more time spent in the home because home heating and home insulation is far, far worse than modern commercial premises are. Margaret Bell: Some work we did in Leicester showed that if you work from home, on average you use 75% more energy than you save by not going into work. And that corresponds to a 75% increase in carbon dioxide - purely and simply because if you need heating and gas, electricity at home, that's more than what you save by not going into work by car. And so, coupled with the isolation effect, it's sensible for local businesses to open up their hot-desking offices, or even have reciprocal arrangements with companies where consultants working more out of town could reciprocate hot-desking in offices. Les Back: We are predominantly talking about people who work in finance service sectors, white-collar jobs and white-collar workers. That isn't the workforce of cities. What about hospital, school and other public sector jobs? Also, cities are important because they're places of encounter. Places of difference. That difference and the negotiations that happen across racial and cultural difference take on particular qualities in the centre of cities that are not the same in the outskirts and in the suburbs. Aude Bicquelet-Lock: Everyone will have gone through the lockdown and will have gone through the changes and had new habits and will have strong views about what it is they want, what works for them and what doesn't. And I think one of the first things we will have to do as urban planners and policymakers is listen to what they want. But there will be financial constraints. Paul Cheshire: The other issue is people's fear: how long will it take people to recover from the experience of being worried about being in crowds, being vulnerable. I think people will recover from that if there is a vaccine, if the virus subsides. If that happens, offices will reassert themselves and all those things we liked doing in city centres will also reassert themselves. That may take quite a long time. Office life for many has changed significantly. Some will choose to continue working from home, while for others shielding, they have no choice in the matter. But when space is at a premium and bedrooms have been turned into work spaces, we want to know what life hacks you've come up with to make the most of tiny areas you are now living and working in.

Concerned rail workers spotted a pair of feet but \"no signs of life\" on the grounds of Chafford Hundred railway station, British Transport Police said. In a tweet, BTP said: \"Rushing to the scene, officers found a man in his late 30s enjoying some nude sunbathing.\" It happened as temperatures reached 25C (77F) on Monday. BTP added: \"Please don't sunbathe nude on the railway.\" Chafford Hundred station sits on a single-line railway between London and Southend. The man was spotted by track workers from Network Rail, who called police. A spokeswoman for Network Rail said: \"Let me lay it bare, the railway is not a place to sunbathe. Please keep away from the tracks.\" A spokeswoman for rail operator C2C, which runs a number of services in Essex, declined to comment but said there had been similar episodes of nude sunbathers in the past. \"It is not as uncommon as you might think,\" she said. A BTP spokesman said the report was made at about 13:00 BST on Monday in the London Road of West Thurrock and \"words of advice were given about the dangers of the railway\"."

        "text": "One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months, with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year. Some airlines have grounded their entire fleets, while others have been focusing on cargo flights, in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can. Now, however, many carriers are making plans to get back in the air. Ryanair, for example, says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from July, EasyJet is starting a limited service this month and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of August, while Air France KLM and Lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of June. Hungarian carrier Wizz Air has already resumed flights. In the UK, the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 June - which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country. But can passengers fly safely, or will they be at risk of infection? The Covid-19 coronavirus is still relatively new, so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply. But previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections. A 2018 study by researchers from Emory University in Atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft, and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases. \"A droplet-mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger. Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger,\" the researchers concluded. But contrary to this, earlier research - led by the same academics - had shown that in real life cases passengers with Sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area. Their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport, while embarking or disembarking from the plane, or from touching contaminated surfaces, rather than by breathing in infected droplets. The simulations also indicated that, because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers, they could generate several new infections, and concluded \"it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill\". Meanwhile, public health officials in Canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from Guangzhou to Toronto were found to have Covid-19. The flight had 350 people on board, and lasted for 15 hours. Although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections, the chief engineer at aerospace giant Airbus insists that is not the case. Jean-Brice Dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean. \"Every two to three minutes, mathematically, all the air is renewed,\" he says. \"That means 20 to 30 times per hour, the air around you is completely renewed.\" Put simply, air is collected from outside the aircraft, normally through the engine, and mixed with recycled air from the cabin. The recycled air, which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels, is passed through HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters that are similar to those used in hospitals. The Covid-19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter (a nanometre is a billionth of a metre) and is within the particle-size range that HEPA filters capture - 10 nanometres and above. Mr Dumont says: \"HEPA filters have standards, and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards. They filter out 99.97% of particulates (small particles) of the size of Covid-19.\" The flow of the air itself, he explains, is also designed to minimise infection risks. \"The air flows vertically. It is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet. That makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited. So a passenger from row one, for example, cannot contaminate someone in row 20.\" But is this enough? This regular flow of air, from top to bottom, can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles, thus altering the path of any airborne particles. And crucially, while HEPA filters do work, they can't capture all Covid-19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in, says Dr Julian Tang, consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and associate professor at Leicester University. He is also one of the team behind a study, published this month, looking at minimising the airborne transmission of Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. \"Filtration only works on mass airflows, most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short-range face-to-face conversations. Close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane, train or a bus - this is the biggest risk.\" And even if you are further away, the risk is not eliminated, says Dr Tang. \"How long Covid-19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors. It varies between different people, it varies depending on the state of your infection, and you can't say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres. \"Some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres - and they all could be carrying the virus.\" Dr Tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as Covid-19 or Mers, Sars and influenza, something which they argue has been overlooked. But Mr Dumont believes that simple precautions, such as wearing masks, and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks. \"I want to be precise on that. We want people to wear masks,\" he says. This, he claims, combined with the rapid replacement of air, should minimise exposure. So, would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft, for example by blocking out middle seats - a move contemplated by some airlines, but described by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary as \"idiotic\"? \"We don't think so,\" says Mr Dumont. \"It doesn't add to the risk reduction, we believe.\" Virologist Dr Tang disagrees: \"The problem is that if you're sitting next to somebody - 0.6 metres in economy, say - who's coughing and sneezing in that immediate area, that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system, get filtered and come back down again.\" Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents airlines, has set out a detailed \"biosecurity roadmap\", which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry. Much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself, but on the time spent in the airport - where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another. It wants that time to be minimised as much as possible. As a result, it is calling for: The actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk - and according to Iata vice president Nick Careem, \"physical distancing on board is not necessary\". The emphasis, he says, should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin, as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas. That could include banning queues for the washrooms. The key message, Mr Careem says is that \"there is no silver bullet, no single measure that can prevent infection\". Dr Tang, meanwhile, says he would fly with precautions. \"If I get on a plane, I'll be wearing a mask. It's not 100% but at least I'll have some protection.\""

        "text": "Cartoonist Priya Kuriyan has drawn a series of pictures showing how masks became the new normal across India -  even before a stringent lockdown was put in place on 25 March. Ms Kuriyan says her art was inspired by her neighbours, as well as people she saw at the airport when she took a flight from the southern city of Bangalore to visit her friend in the eastern city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). This was before masks were made mandatory and flights grounded. However, the threat of Covid-19 had just begun to emerge so some people had already begun wearing face coverings as protection. \"At that point, we had no idea of the disarray the next few months would bring,\" she says. Her cartoons are humorous snapshots of people, trying to live their normal lives amid the backdrop of the looming pandemic - like the honeymooning couple in the first picture, who Ms Kuriyan says seemed \"determined to get their honeymoon to a flying start\". The next image - of \"Batman\" landing at the Kolkata airport was during a time she says that bats were being discussed in great detail within the context of the coronavirus' origins. \"Information about bats were just flying around,\" she says. The next cartoon is inspired by a scene Ms Kuriyan witnessed at the Bangalore airport. At the baggage claim belt, a group of sales girls were returning from an offsite trip, in identical sarees and masks. \"Something had clearly gone viral,\" says Ms Kuriyan. But the masks were not only being restricted to airports. People had started wearing them every time they left their homes. \"Back in my home in Bangalore, the only people to be spotted were those from my neighbourhood who I saw during my fortnightly visits to the grocers - many of them wearing some form of homemade mask,\" she says. But there was some creativity to be had as well. In Kolkata, these young men seemed to be the only ones with some premonition of the chaos that was to come - and they accessorised accordingly. But mask or no mask, some habits die hard. Like for instance, this group of people who were still posing - and smiling - for the mandatory \"airport selfie\". The idea of social distancing is also one that is hard to stomach for many Indians, and Ms Kuriyan says she saw many examples of \"social distancing fail\". \"On other days of social isolation, spying out from my kitchen window, to the street across my apartment, I was witness to some social distancing fail. It was a metaphor of how ironic the idea of social distancing was in a country where not even the real estate on a scooter is spared,\" she says. All images copyright"

        "text": "There is widespread outrage in Nigeria following the murder of a 22-year-old university student in a church where she was studying in the southern city of Benin. The family of Uwavera Omozuwa, known as Uwa, say she was brutally raped and bludgeoned to death. It is one of several shocking cases in the past week which have led to street protests, an online petition signed by thousands and a Twitter hashtag #WeAreTired. Many Nigerians point to a legal system they say makes it hard to convict suspected rapists and blames women when they are victims of sexual assault. Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing The first time 36-year-old Wanda Ebe was sexually molested, she was under six years of age. She says her nanny, a middle-aged woman, forced her to repeatedly perform oral sex on her when they were alone. At the age of six, an attempt by Ms Ebe to stop the abuse by threatening to report the nanny to her parents almost cost her her life. \"She [the nanny] poured a bucket full of hot water on me that left me in excruciating pain. I had to be taken to the hospital and I missed a year of school,\" Ms Ebe told the BBC. Ms Ebe said the nanny told her parents it was an accident and so, fearing for her safety, she did not say anything more at the time. The second time Ms Ebe was sexually abused, she was a 21-year-old student in her second year at university who was recovering from a recent surgery. She recalls being raped by a doctor, who made an excuse to take her to his house for an appointment instead of a medical centre. \"He tore off my clothes, and raped me,\" she said. \"I was weak from the surgery and could do little to resist him.\" \"I did not go to the police or anyone for that matter. I did not even know that rape cases were to be reported to the police.\" In Nigeria, it is not uncommon for rape to go unreported. Some victims and their families, fearing stigmatisation, police extortion and a lack of trust in the judicial process, choose not to report cases to the authorities. There have also been instances where those brave enough to report are targeted with derogatory comments at the police station.  2,279reported cases of rape and indecent assault 1,164reported cases of \"unnatural offences\" (ie anal sex) 0convictions reported by police 1state (out of 36) reported no cases of indecent assault \"They are either vilified for their dressing, being at the wrong place at the wrong time or accused of making up claims of rape,\" said Ms Ebe, who is now a social worker and runs a charity helping street children, people with disabilities and survivors of sexual abuse. She often talks about her experiences in order to help other rape survivors. She says victims often find brick walls at the hospitals, police stations and courts where they are supposed to get justice. \"The penalty for rape in Nigeria is up to 14 years in prison, but I have seen a judge sentence someone to just four years, with two years suspended, because he was young and had a life in front of him,\" she said. \"What about the victim whose life he adversely affected?\" In 2019 in the capital Abuja, some women who were arrested during a police raid accused officers of raping them. They said the police accused them of being sex workers and while they were at the police station, they were repeatedly raped by officers. The police denied the accusations and the matter is currently in court. \"Such incidents don't reassure victims that the police station is where they can get help,\" their representative, Dorothy Njemanze, told the BBC. No one knows exactly how many rapes take place in the West African state annually. The official Nigeria Bureau of Statistics said more than 2,200 cases of rape and indecent assault were reported in 2017. But experts say the true number of rapes is likely to be much higher. \"We get at least six people coming in for cases of domestic violence per week,\" Ms Njemanze said. \"During the coronavirus lockdown, we started receiving four to seven cases per day and 70% of them were related to rape.\" The results of a survey published by NOIPolls in July 2019 suggested that up to one in every three girls living in Nigeria could have experienced at least one form of sexual assault by the time they reach 25. Recent laws have broadened the scope under which sexual offences can be penalised in Nigeria, making it easier to try suspects. \"Before now the part of the Nigerian constitution that deals with rape was in the criminal code and meant that cases had to be tried within two months or they would be statute barred [ineligible to be heard in a court], but that is no longer the case,\" Stephanie Ekpebulu, from a coalition of lawyers that does pro bono work with rape victims, told the BBC. However, many states across Nigeria have not implemented the new laws. \"Most states in northern Nigeria practise the sharia system of justice that would run at variance with the Violence Against Persons Prohibition Act [one of the new laws],\" lawyer Okani Emmanuel said. \"In the north it's the religion, in the south it is down to the cultural impediments where they have some widowhood practices that run contrary to the law,\" he said. The shortcomings in Nigeria's legal system, where any case is likely to take years to prosecute and a police force accused of not being thorough in its investigations, also discourages victims from approaching the courts for justice. Ms Njemanze advises anyone who has been raped to try and preserve evidence, like clothing, that can be used in court. \"Most times hospitals want to see a police report before treating and that's very unfair because it's a time-bound crime,\" she said. \"The first thing is to preserve all the evidence that we can get and treat for sexually transmitted infections.\" You may also be interested in: Prosecutorial agencies like the police have also been accused of hampering the chances of victims getting a fair hearing in court. \"Most times the police take the victims to private hospitals where there are bills to be paid and expect traumatised victims to foot them. In extreme cases, the suspects are asked to foot the bills,\" asked Mr Emmanuel. \"How can such a system guarantee justice?\" Following the outburst of national outrage, police announced they had made an arrest in the case of Uwa, whose body was found in a church. They said a fire extinguisher used in her murder was examined by forensic experts and fingerprints of the suspect identified. Nigeria's police chief also announced special investigators would be deployed to gender desks at police stations across the country to respond to increasing challenges of sexual assaults and gender-based violence. However, Uwa's case has not been without its own controversy. Her family accused the police of making snide comments and demanding bribes before investigating the case. \"They asked my father if he was the first person [whose] daughter would be raped,\" the victim's sister told journalists. This is the video of Uwa\u2019s sister talking about the police and their reaction to her sister\u2019s death. pic.twitter.com/Lo5dgqGAKJ End of Twitter post  by @BadmanSophss Police have not responded to the allegations. Some of the recent campaigning has also been against a culture of \"victim blaming\" in Nigerian society. Stop the Rape!!Stop victim shaming and blaming!!!We are tired of being afraid in our own skin... #WeAreTired #JusticeForUwa #SayNoToRape pic.twitter.com/QDgLQ3qd48 End of Twitter post  by @EdoFirstLady While another suggested that wearing a hijab was no protection. \"Dress properly\"\"Thank God Islam gave us hijab\"Don't be stupid!I had my hijab on all through when I was raped. End of Twitter post  by @hauwa_ojeifo The online anger has also been directed at official systems campaigners say focuses too much on educating girls about sex but ignores the boys who become men. \"It's time to teach the boys what consent is and that No is No,\" Ms Ekpebulu told the BBC.

        "text": "\"There's a big black sky over my town.\" That line from Dancing On My Own is Robyn's love letter to the weather in her home city of Stockholm, Sweden. It's one of her two favourite lyrics from the track, which has just turned ten years old. It also happens to be my favourite song of all time. That means I've spent a decade of dancing and singing to it at clubs, festivals and in friends' kitchens. It's soundtracked some of the most personal moments in my life. Under recent lockdown, it's been viewed in another new light with an accompanying TikTok challenge from Robyn herself. Like many other people, I love the bittersweet combination of hearing something so uplifting yet so heartbreaking. There are so many highlights but Robyn tells me her other favourite line is: \"I just wanna dance all night.\" At that point in the song, she's already taken us to the club where we're watching her ex kiss a new partner. We've all been there, right? She says it represents the precise moment on the dancefloor when you have to get your \"desperation, frustration and sadness out\". It's been described as the \"ultimate sad banger\". End of Youtube post  by RobynVEVO With its multiple cover versions and the number of films and TV shows it's popped up in, the song is considered a classic with outlets like Rolling Stone, NME and Stereogum all ranking it as the best song of the last decade. By 2010, Robyn had transformed from mid-1990s major label pop star into a fiercely independent artist with her own record label, Konichiwa Records. With Every Heartbeat had also given her a UK number one single in 2007. Dancing On My Own was her first new music in years and the lead single from the first of her three Body Talk albums, which she released over six months. \"I knew I wanted to make a song called Dancing On My Own,\" Robyn tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, from her apartment in Stockholm. \"I just didn't know what it was going to be about.\" With an idea of a chorus in her mind, Robyn started working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger, who she'd collaborated with on her previous album. At the beginning, Patrik remembers the song having an acoustic vibe. The chorus came first and \"everything else fell into place and it felt like it was writing itself\". Patrik admits they were \"super picky\" about every aspect of the song and he recently found a notebook with hundreds of lyrics that were written and scrapped along the way. \"Every single word needed to feel right,\" he tells Newsbeat. His favourite lyric is \"I know where you're at, I bet she's around\" which he feels represents the \"self-destructive part of you, when we know we shouldn't go there. It's like scratching a wound.\" Robyn also remembers Patrik spending a lot of time on the individual components of the song: the drums, the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with. \"We kept building and it kept getting better and better and better,\" she says. \"It was an exciting session. I remember sending the demo to the record label and telling them I thought we had a good single.\" Robyn says she's proud of Dancing On My Own because it features elements of \"many different worlds\" she loves including: \"Prince songs, 80s rock ballads and queer electronica\". The song was a hit. Dancing On My Own made number eight in the UK Singles Chart. It went on to top year-end critics' polls, Robyn performed it on TV shows around the world and it was nominated for a Grammy. Then came the first of Robyn's two defining moments in the life of her song. We'll get to the second later. In 2012, it was used in the first season of HBO's Girls, the TV comedy drama created by Lena Dunham. Robyn says the use of the song was \"genius\" while Lena Dunham tells Newsbeat it was \"magical\". In the episode, Lena's character Hannah finds out her ex-boyfriend is gay. She's sat in her flat and Dancing On My Own starts up on her laptop. Her best friend Marnie (Alison Williams) comes home and they dance in Hannah's bedroom to the track, which then plays over the end credits. \"That moment on set was meant to be so brief and so light,\" says Lena. \"But it took on so much importance because it marked the first time myself and Alison felt comfortable in our characters.\" Off camera she says the whole crew was dancing and people were crying. \"You could feel the power and love that went into the song.\" When Lena accepted her Golden Globe for best actress in 2013, Dancing On My Own was playing as she walked to the stage collect it. \"It was like having a companion in that very public moment.\" Dancing On My Own has also been featured in Gossip Girl, Orange Is The New Black, RuPaul's Drag Race, movies Teen Spirit and Long Shot, and the Masked Singer USA. It's also been covered multiple times by artists including Kings Of Leon and Kelly Clarkson. \"I really like Kelly's version,\" says Robyn. \"She has a really powerful voice. She recorded one of my favourite Max Martin songs, Since U Been Gone, which I covered in the Radio 1 Live Lounge. So that's funny.\" But its most famous cover is by Calum Scott, who gave the song a second lease of life. In 2015, the British singer auditioned for Britain's Got Talent with a stripped-back version of the track, the video of which has now been viewed  288 million times. \"I fell in love with the song instantly,\" he says. \"I was about 21 when it was originally released and it came at the height of me figuring out my personality.\" He points to the lyric \"I'm right over here, why can't you see me?\" as the precise moment he connected to the song. Calum struggled with his sexuality growing up. He says Dancing On My Own became his anthem. \"I didn't really know who I was, so when I sang it all those emotions from my past spilled over into the song.\" End of Youtube post  by CalumScottVEVO Calum's version was released commercially in 2016 and performed better than Robyn's original, reaching number two in the UK singles chart. \"I owe my career to Robyn,\" he says. He also describes the \"surreal moment\" when the two of them met - by chance - at the BBC. \"She walked past and I just froze. She came up to me and said it was nice to finally meet me. You never expect to meet the person who had the original song\". NO WORDS. \u2764\ufe0f @robynkonichiwa A post shared by  Calum Scott (@calumscott) on Dec 4, 2018 at 4:41am PST End of Instagram post  by calumscott Robyn says Calum and his voice interpreted it in a way that \"made the song came alive again\". \"I'm super happy for him to have the success and am pleased people got to know the song a little bit more\". She says there have been so many covers because \"it's a great song\". But as Calum was bringing the song to a far wider audience in the mid-2010s, Robyn was taking a step back from what she'd created. \"Dancing On My Own sometimes felt like a teenage version of me that I was happy to let go of,\" she says. The song came from a break-up in her own life and she became \"tired of the broken heart\". \"I went through a lot of therapy, worked on myself and healed myself. \"Now I'm back loving it. I don't feel conflicted and I love performing it and playing it live.\" End of Youtube post  by Robyn When Robyn toured in 2019, she cut the song just before the chorus, leaving thousands of fans to sing her track back at her. I was at her gig at London's Alexandra Palace. It was such a goosebump moment to join everyone else singing \"I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her\" at the tops of our voices. At the time, I remember Robyn seemed to be genuinely overwhelmed by it. \"It's like the song was talking back to me,\" she says. By that point, she felt the song had moved on from its beginnings and \"became something that took on meaning for a lot of people in different ways\". For someone that often writes about heartbreak and emotions, Robyn says she finds nostalgia and sentimentality \"difficult\". \"Those emotions don't always feel true to me and I think Dancing On My Own has those qualities. \"It's maybe a part of the song I had to struggle with. But maybe that's why it connects to so many people too.\" In February, Robyn was named Songwriter of the Decade at the NME Awards, an accolade handed to her by Christine & The Queens and Charli XCX. Charli says Robyn \"continuously evolved\" in her career but \"has always stayed true to who she is\". H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier of Christine & The Queens described her songwriting as \"pop perfection\". \"As a songwriter I can only marvel at a song like Dancing On My Own,\" says Letissier. \"It's a gem of pop. I watched her gig in Oslo last year and it was the most cathartic thing I ever saw.\" As we mentioned earlier, Robyn has a second defining moment of the track. It involves her friend and collaborator Max Martin, who himself has co-written 22 Billboard Hot 100 number ones and played an early part in her career on songs like Show Me Love. According to Robyn, she was told by his manager that Max thinks \"it's one of the best pop songs ever made\". \"And that makes me very happy and proud.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

They allow users to tip a bucket of water using a foot pedal to avoid touching surfaces to reduce infections. Stephen came up with the idea after learning on TV about ways to prevent catching the virus. Kenya has reported more than 2,000 cases of Covid-19 and 69 deaths. Stephen and his family live in Mukwa village, in Bungoma country, western Kenyan, which has not reported a single case of the virus. His father, James Wamukota, however, worries that it could still come to his area. \"I had bought some pieces of wood to make a window frame, but I when I came back home after work one day I found that Stephen had made the machine,\" Mr Wamukota told the BBC. \"The concept was his and I helped tighten the machine. I'm very proud,\" he said. Mr Wamukota, who repairs electronic goods for a living, said that his son has always been keen to learn his trade. He posted his son's invention on Facebook and was surprised how quickly it was shared, he said. Stephen was among 68 Kenyans given the Presidential Order of Service, Uzalendo (Patriotic) Award on Monday. Stephen said that he wants to be an engineer when he grows up and the county governor has promised to give him a scholarship, Mr Wamukota said."

        "text": "After a police officer shot and killed Greg Crockett's best friend, he left Minnesota for good. Then in the aftermath of George Floyd's killing, he decided he couldn't stay away. How everything and nothing changed after the death of Philando Castile. Greg Crockett was sitting in the passenger seat of his grandfather's van when he saw that - in the midst of rapidly escalating protests over the death of an unarmed black man named George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer - an auto parts store near his old neighbourhood was on fire. Although he moved away from Minnesota almost two years ago, Crockett told his grandfather he needed to go. In response, his grandfather, a retired Marine, quoted Che Guevara. \"The revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe. You have to make it fall.\" As Crockett's flight descended over the Minneapolis-St Paul International Airport, an older white woman peered out the window, wondering if she'd be able to see the fires from the plane. That night, from nearly the moment his feet hit the pavement, Crockett - a thin, acerbic 37-year-old who works at the Phoenix international airport - witnessed a rolling carnival of chaos. For over two hours, until his phone died, he captured scene after scene of casual destruction, at turns horrifying and darkly comedic. A boy who looked no older than 15 or 16 lobbed a Molotov cocktail into a grocery store, only to have the lit rag fall out and singe his legs. A group of 30 people worked furiously to break open a drive-through ATM, until an older man sauntered up at a theatrically slow pace with an enormous sledgehammer over one shoulder. A young woman wilted in the street. Her friends tried to carry her into a car that offered a ride to the hospital, but then drove off at the last second without them. There was not a police officer in sight. The red and blue lights of squad cars glinted blocks away. \"It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood,\" Crockett sang through his medical mask. He ducked through a looted bank, a liquor store, a probation office, and a Mexican restaurant, where he found five masked men making themselves burritos, like college kids at the end of long night of partying. He helped himself to some beers, knocked over a beverage dispenser that stained his jeans. Occasionally he took a swig from a fifth of Courvoisier that a looter handed him on the street. \"We out here, Minnesota. The revolution is starting right here,\" he said into the camera. \"We shoulda did this four years ago when they killed Philando. We shoulda been out here.\" In 2016, back when Crockett still lived in Minnesota, a police officer named Jeronimo Yanez shot and killed Crockett's best friend, Philando Castile. When Crockett met Castile, he was a quiet, braces-wearing video game fanatic. The teeth braces came off but by all accounts little else about Castile changed. He became a well-regarded employee of St Paul Public School's food services division, known to students as \"Mr Phil\". To friends, he was \"Chedda\" because he always had a job and always made money. Yanez pulled Castile over in a neighbourhood roughly 15 minutes away from the street where George Floyd would die in 2020. After Castile informed Yanez he had a firearm, for which he was properly licensed, Yanez seemingly panicked, firing into the car and hitting Castile seven times. Castile's girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, turned on her Facebook Live seconds later, and captured her dying boyfriend's final moments while her four-year-old daughter watched from the backseat. What happened next has become a routine in the US. The broadcast went viral. Castile's name became a hashtag. Protesters hit the streets all over the country. Crockett and the rest of the pallbearers donned white suits that matched the one Castile wore inside his casket at a funeral that was carried on national television and attended by the governor of Minnesota. Crockett remembers wanting to be angry, to be angry the way George Floyd protesters are angry now. But Castile's mother, whom Crockett calls his \"auntie\", told them to be peaceful. To let the criminal justice system do its work. \"She asked us to be cool,\" said Crockett. \"We held it in. We held in our anger. We held in our emotions. We asked politely.\" Manslaughter charges were brought against the officer, in which the prosecutor called Castile \"compliant\" and \"respectful\". But less than a year after the killing, a jury acquitted Yanez. The day of the acquittal was at the forefront of Crockett's mind as he moved down Lake Street, past decapitated coin-operated parking metres and storefronts curtained with flames. If there had been an uprising in Minneapolis after #PhilandoCastile, would there have been a #GeorgeFloyd? \"RIP George - none of us knew you,\" Crockett said into the camera. \"We shoulda did this four years ago. You shouldn't even be dead. \"They won't stop killing us. We want you to stop killing us.\" Two days later, Crockett sat in a friend's backyard smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer. Brian McIntosh, the home's owner, wheeled an old, black office chair to the door of the garage and pointed at it. This is where Castile sat, he said, two weeks before he died. They'd played a game of chess. \"Minding his own business,\" McIntosh said. Response to Crockett's Facebook Live was mixed. Some cheered him on. Some scolded him for being a part of a night that left an iconic corridor of South Minneapolis gutted by fire, water damage and looting. Challenged about his behaviour, Crockett was unfazed. \"A lot of people are really quiet folks. Everything that happens to them, they hold it in [until] they get drunk. That's when they let it out,\" he said. \"This is the result. This is what y'all get. You can't keep pushing a person and thinking they're gonna keep letting you push them. No, one day they're going to push back. Now we pushing back. Now we're drunk.\" A string of bad luck convinced Crockett to leave Minnesota two years ago. He got mugged at gunpoint. He got fired. He lost his apartment. His car got towed with all his belongings. Not long after that, he got on a flight to Arizona and vowed not to come back. The Midwest, Crockett said, is not the same place that his great-grandfather moved to in 1947, in the second wave of the Great Migration. Their family left West Helena, Arkansas, to escape Jim Crow laws, to seek better jobs, a better education for their children, to achieve homeownership. The same type of reasons that the Castile family came to Minnesota from Missouri. The same reasons George Floyd moved up from Houston, Texas. But the Midwest changed. The factories shut and the schools got more segregated and the quality of life gap between black and white Midwesterners got wider and wider. Crockett's parents fled Gary, Indiana, a troubled town that cratered when the steel industry left. They bounced around from Indiana to Wisconsin to Minnesota. He attended nine elementary schools and four middle schools before they settled in St Paul. Castile wasn't even the first person Crockett knew who was killed by police - his uncle Darryl Burns was killed by an Indianapolis police officer in 1992 at a traffic stop. Crockett was 10. He has flashes of it in his memory. The phone call his mother took in the kitchen. A trip to Indianapolis to find out what happened. His uncle's Monte Carlo strafed with bullet holes. At this point, Crockett's views have grown bleak. He no longer believes that a life sentence for his friend's killer would have prevented another death like George Floyd's. He's no longer sure he believes that peaceful integration is even possible. He feels that black people in America are essentially stateless. \"People talk about, 'We gonna fight back.' We can't fight back when we're on enemy land,\" he said. Talking about it is overwhelming. \"I'm tired,\" he said, his eyes welling up. \"I'm so [expletive] tired.\" After Philando died, Crockett said all he did was work. He made good money but stopped paying his credit card bills. He coped by drinking. He moved through life as if in a metaphorical \"blackout\". But now, for the first time in four years, at the intersection of Lake Street and Chicago with flames leaping from the buildings on all sides, Crockett felt something different. Something he knows others will find offensive. \"I feel great,\" he said. \"I feel alive.\" With his airport job on an indefinite hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic, Crockett is buying up super-cheap plane tickets. From Minneapolis he flies to Nashville, Tennessee. From there he'll go to Atlanta, Georgia. Then it's on to Cleveland, Ohio, and the nation's capitol, Washington, DC. \"I'm gonna talk everywhere I go,\" he said. \"I'm going to represent Philando everywhere I go.\" He said he wants to see the revolution first-hand. \"All it takes is one little spark to light everything the [expletive] up and that's what happened. Minneapolis - this little bitty ass place,\" he said. \"It's so beautiful. It's so beautiful. It's absolutely beautiful.\""
