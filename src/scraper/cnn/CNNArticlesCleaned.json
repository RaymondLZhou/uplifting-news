        "text": "theres a growing group of dissenters who believe americans can survive without law enforcement as we know it and americans those dissenters believe may even be better off without it the solution to police brutality and racial inequalities in policing is simple supporters say just defund police its as straightforward as it sounds instead of funding a police department a sizable chunk of a citys budget is invested in communities especially marginalized ones where much of the policing occurs the concepts been a murmur for years particularly following the protests against police brutality in ferguson missouri though it seemed improbable in 2014 but its becoming a shout with the deaths of george floyd and breonna taylor at the hands of police and nationwide protests demanding reform at least one city is considering dissolving its police force altogether does defunding the police mean disbanding the police that depends on who you ask said philip mcharris a doctoral candidate in sociology at yale university and lead research and policy associate at the community resource hub for safety and accountability some supporters of divestment want to reallocate some but not all funds away from police departments to social services some want to strip all police funding and dissolve departments the concept exists on a spectrum but both interpretations center on reimagining what public safety looks like he said it also means dismantling the idea that police are public stewards meant to protect communities many black americans and other people of color dont feel protected by police mcharris said why defund police mcharris says divesting funds ends the culture of punishment in the criminal justice system and its one of the only options local governments havent tried in their attempts to end deaths in police custody trainings and body cameras havent brought about the change supporters want mcharris grew up in a neighborhood where there were real discernible threats of gun violence and he said he never thought to call the police    that was for his own safety instead he relied on neighbors who helped him navigate threats of danger what if he said those people could provide the same support they showed him on a full time basis to explain why he supports the idea isaac bryan the director of uclas black policy center points to history law enforcement in the south began as slave patrol a team of vigilantes hired to recapture escaped slaves then when slavery was abolished police enforced jim crow laws    even the most minor infractions and today police disproportionately use force against black people and black people are more likely to be arrested and sentenced that history is engrained in our law enforcement bryan said where would those funds go patrisse cullors co founder of the black lives matter movement said defunding the police means reallocating those funds to support people and services in marginalized communities defunding law enforcement means that we are reducing the ability for law enforcement to have resources that harm our communities cullors said in an interview with wbur bostons public radio station its about reinvesting those dollars into black communities communities that have been deeply divested from those dollars can be put back into social services for mental health domestic violence and homelessness among others police are often the first responders to all three she said those dollars can be used to fund schools hospitals housing and food in those communities too    all of the things we know increase safety mcharris said why disband police disbanding police altogether falls on the more radical end of the police divestment spectrum but its gaining traction mpd150 a community advocacy organization in minneapolis focuses on abolishing local police its work has been spotlighted since the death of george floyd in minneapolis police custody the people who respond to crises in our community should be the people who are best equipped to deal with those crises the organization says rather than strangers armed with guns the organization says first responders should be mental health providers social workers victim advocates and other community members in less visible roles it argues law and order isnt abetted by law enforcement but through education jobs and mental health services that low income communities are often denied mpd150 and other police abolition organizations want wider access to all three would defunding police lead to an uptick in violent crimes defunding police on a large scale hasnt been done before so its tough to say but theres evidence that less policing can lead to less crime a 2017 report which focused on several weeks in 2014 through 2015 when the new york police department purposely pulled back on proactive policing found that there were 2100 fewer crime complaints during that time the study defines proactive policing as the systematic and aggressive enforcement of low level violations and heightened police presence in areas where crime is anticipated thats exactly the kind of activity that police divestment supporters want to end will defunding the police come to pass its radical for an american city to operate without law enforcement but its already being discussed in minneapolis city council member steve fletcher in a twitter thread said council members are discussing what it would take to disband the minneapolis police department and start fresh with a community oriented non violent public safety and outreach capacity we can totally reimagine what public safety means what skills were recruiting for what tools we do and dont need he wrote we can invest in cultural competency and mental health training de escalation and conflict resolution defunding is simpler than disbanding though and at least one mayors already taken that step after californians decried a proposal to increase the los angeles police department budget to $186 billion los angeles mayor eric garcetti agreed to slash between $100 million to $150 million from the proposed funding its not a significant dent in the budget but its proof that officials are listening bryan said a week ago defunding the police in any capacity would sound like pie in the sky he said now were talking about it defunding police in its entirety still might sound like pie in the sky but next week might be different "

        "text": "mukhtar ibrahim didnt imagine the communities he covers would be at the epicenter of protests sweeping the nation when he founded a startup news website in minnesota last year but in the aftermath of george floyds death ibrahim and his small staff at the sahan journal have been on the front lines the nonprofit news site is dedicated to covering immigrants and refugees in minnesota and ibrahim says in recent days theyve been pushing to cover important angles many national media stories have missed like why a growing number of young somalis are joining the protests in minneapolis and what happened after the citys only spanish language radio station burned down the 32 year old editor and executive director spoke with cnn this week about what his team is seeing on the streets of minneapolis the interview has been edited for length and clarity q minnesota is known for having a large somali immigrant community how have they been impacted by george floyds death and by the protests and how have you seen somali immigrants responding a the somalis are also black and theyve been disproportionately affected by the police activities and if you go to the protests they are more highly visible than before the younger generation clearly came out this time probably they have more interactions with the police than their parents or they can relate more with the african american experience than their parents i used to cover protests before and this is completely different i saw a lot of young somalis participating especially young females wearing the hijab and all that we talked to a lot of people who say they are afraid of the police when they see a police officer they tense up and those experiences show the lack of trust between the black community and the police and it doesnt matter whether you are a new immigrant or whether you were born here or whether your parents fled from civil war its almost the same experience as the african american community q and you mentioned that there can be kind of a generation gap between older somalis and younger somalis why is that a the older generation some of them fled civil war they went through traumatizing events they came here to have a better life and to raise a family and all that so they are probably more grateful to be here and you know while their kids who were born here dont have all that baggage they see whats going on these kids they went through the educational system they have more history under their belt they learned about inequalities and they experience them themselves on the streets and that kind of creates a gap q i have seen some stories quoting somalis talking about how they survived war and they came to this country as refugees in search of safety and now theyre finding themselves in the midst of this situation is that something youve been seeing what is it like for them and what is it like for you as someone who came to the us from somalia years ago to see violence erupting in this country a i mean the dynamics are different but you know at the end of the day its violence and you know buildings burned down and looting and all of that some people get flashbacks because this reminds them of what they have fled but we know whats causing this and that makes a difference in somalia people were fighting against each other it was a civil war here its completely different its a system against people and you cannot compare those two here there are protests if something is burned down you can always rebuild a building thats been damaged but the killing of george floyd really shows how the system affects people q theres also a geographic connection right between the somali community and the part of minneapolis where mr floyd was killed a yeah that area is actually one of the most diverse places in minneapolis there are a lot of immigrant owned businesses and community centers and mosques and its a vibrant corridor and its the heart of a lot of latino owned and somali owned businesses if you look at the stores damaged or businesses being affected its predominately immigrant owned q what do you want the world to know about the situation youre seeing unfolding in your community right now when you see national coverage of george floyds death and the protests in minneapolis what are the stories you think arent being told that should be a i think the human toll of this is something that i havent seen really being covered the coverage tends to be a little bit disconnected from what people are feeling their experiences how they have been through this multiple times how its affecting them the trauma that this causes    the generational trauma these kids their parents their grandparents its something that has been going on for centuries i think that hasnt been explored enough and you know the media tend to carry the official narrative and give more weight to that than the human voices and the community voices i hope they will shift the focus a little bit and make it more human centric more community centric than just you know quoting talking heads or quoting officials you see young people being really frustrated and you wonder why why is everyone frustrated why do they hate the police why the cursing at the police whats causing that im always more curious to learn about that than just covering the latest developments q and in conversations that you and your colleagues have been having with people how have they been answering that question why are they feeling this way a theyre saying the police harass them they intimidate them even if they dont do anything they stop them when theyre even walking down the street and that way of policing is something that really frustrates people  you know when youre interacting with the young black person really upset and crying and afraid of the police it breaks your heart and thats not what probably the white community experiences and you just ask why q what has it been like for your site to be covering this moment in minnesotas history and in the united states history a we are a small staff we have been trying to really tackle this from unique angles because its something affecting a lot of people so if you look at our coverage we have written about the young somalis we have written about how the asian community is being targeted one of the officers is hmong and some people target people who have similar last names as the police officer we have been covering how the immigrant businesses have been damaged during the protests q what has stood out or surprised you as someone who is an expert in covering these communities and has been doing it for a while a the diversity of the protesters its really a lot of different communities ethnic backgrounds this case really hit a nerve and you can see that on the street  ive lived here for almost 16 years i have never seen anything like this "

military officials who have strongly criticized the presidents response to the nationwide protests surrounding the police killing of george floyd we have a constitution and we have to follow that constitution and the president has drifted away from it powell a retired general who served under president george w bush told cnns jake tapper on state of the union the comments from powell the first african american secretary of state and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff add to a growing list of rebukes made in recent days by former top officials who have expressed discontent with trumps strongman approach to the protests sparked by the death of floyd a black man who was killed in late may by a white police officer in minneapolis powell said hes proud of what a number of former generals admirals and diplomats have said about trumps response last week to the widespread protests adding that he hadnt released a public statement denouncing trumps response because he felt he had demonstrated his displeasure with trump in 2016 when he voted against him i think what were seeing now is the most massive protest movement i have ever seen in my life i think it suggests the country is getting wise to this and were not going to put up with it anymore the retired general told tapper in contrast he called out republican lawmakers for largely staying silent on trumps response last week to the national unrest i watched the senators heading into the chamber the other day after all this broke with the reporters saying what do you have to say what do they you to say he said they had nothing to say they would not react powell throws his support behind biden the former republican official also said he is he is planning to vote for democrat joe biden for president in november again voting against trump as he had done in 2016 im very close to joe biden on a social matter and on a political matter i worked with him for 35 40 years and he is now the candidate and i will be voting for him powell said asked why it was so important to him that trump not be reelected powell said that he thinks trump has not been an effective president and that he lies all the time what we have to do now is reach out to the whole people watch these demonstrations watch these protests and rather than curse them embrace them to see what it is we have to do to get out of the situation that we find ourselves in now he told tapper were america were americans we can do this we have the ability to do it and we ought to do it make america not just great but strong and great for all americans not just a couple trump attacked powell on twitter shortly after his interview sunday blasting the former bush official as a real stiff and biden as another stiff the president also lashed out at the former secretary of state for his role in presenting the us case against iraq to the united nations in 2003 nations moral standing demonized under trump the former secretary of state told tapper he thinks the united states moral standing on the world stage has been demonized under trumps leadership theyre looking at these demonstrations they see that these are demonstrations that are justified and not to be criticized they see that george as the president called him was murdered and the president comes out and says well george is looking down from heaven and blessing what im doing how can you expect anybody to believe things like that powell asked the former secretary of state and son of immigrants became emotional as he told tapper that americas allies as well as some of its adversaries are looking at how the nation is caring for its citizens and not understanding what they are witnessing are we insulting everybody are we going after immigrants they dont understand this powell said im the son of immigrants i wouldnt be here if my parents couldnt come here in banana boats in the 1920s this is america this is who we are and the world doesnt understand the international community has in recent days condemned the killing of floyd expressing shock and horror at his death though few leaders have criticized trump by name in the wake of the unrest spanish prime minister pedro sanchez said last week that we are all very concerned about the authoritarian debate and those authoritarian ways that we are seeing as a response to some demonstrations and at home in the us trumps former defense secretary james mattis said in a blistering statement last week that trump does not even pretend to try to unite the country and is instead engaged in a deliberate effort to divide the country while lacking mature leadership and former white house chief of staff john kelly said friday that he agreed with mattis assessment and that he thinks theres an awful big concern that the partisanship has gotten out of hand the tribal thing has gotten out of hand asked by tapper if he agreed specifically with mattis comments powell doubled down on his criticism of trump you have to agree with it i mean look at what he has done to divide us he said i agree with all of my former colleagues im proud of what theyre doing im proud that they were willing to take the risk of speaking honesty and speaking truth to those who are not speaking truth powell said this story has been updated with additional developments sunday cnns alison main contributed to this story"

lincoln a determined look it was widely distributed and credited with helping him win the nomination and the presidency since then presidents have enlisted the aid of photographers to put themselves in the best light against the most compelling possible backdrop a press aide in richard nixons administration popularized the term photo op and in the age of internet video the tactic is more relevant than ever but there has never been a photo op quite like the one president donald trump staged on monday when noxious gas flashbangs and rubber bullets were used to force protesters from lafayette park to clear the way before trump strode to st johns church and posed holding up a bible and perhaps there has never been a photo op that has gone so spectacularly wrong as demonstrations spread throughout the us over the killing of george floyd in police custody    and a few protests turned violent   trump warned governors they were being weak in rose garden comments before the church photo op he pronounced himself the president of law and order retired generals faith leaders and even a few republican elected officials excoriated trump for his response to the protests as an episcopalian i was mortified by the use of one of my denominations churches as a backdrop for president trumps call for a military crackdown wrote author diana butler bass as a christian i was shocked when he brandished a book of love to sanction violence against american citizens as a person of faith i was offended as he made god as a prop seeking to further divide the nation into tribes of righteous followers versus heathen protesters and as a human being i was appalled to watch trump    with his history of bigotry and racism    cloak himself in a mantle of faith white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany likened the trump walk to winston churchills visits to bomb damaged neighborhoods of the uk during world war ii  but thats wrong on every level wrote michael dantonio churchill was a leader who sought to unite he argued trump is a divider who seems more inclined to perform than to lead the real purpose of the photo op the world knew that when protesters gathered near the white house last week trump had briefly been taken to shelter in a bunker said dantonio he had looked weak and this would not do encouraged by  his daughter ivanka he decided to demonstrate he was in command by leaving fortress white house and striding to a nearby episcopal church    historic st johns    where a small fire set by protesters had done damage to the basement the moment rattled a

george floyd police officer derek chauvin kept his knee on george floyds neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds thats how long mourners stood in silence at his memorial service this week in minneapolis on thursday it was the floyd family showing us amazing grace through their sorrow wrapping their loving arms around us making us forget our problems and our pain wrote roxanne jones they allowed us to breathe for a moment and get to know george floyd the man as he was in life    instead of knowing him only by the horrifying circumstances of his death another unarmed black person dead after an encounter with police dr erica farrand a pulmonologist and critical care physician in the bay area wrote that she has wrestled with racism and discovered that in an effort to work harder and be better to fit the mold and gain a platform i had unconsciously or consciously stopped bringing my whole self to work three days after george floyds plea i cant breathe was met with apathy and violence farrand added i stood at the bedside of another black man his bed in the icu was surrounded by machines and monitors the tubing for three different masks snaked toward his face i leaned in close and introduced myself im dr farrand im a pulmonologist and i am here to help he pulled his oxygen mask down and replied i cant breathe so triggering are those three words for me that when this patient whispered them my immediate response was i promise you are safe justice gets a step closer the charges against derek chauvin were upgraded to second degree murder wednesday and prosecutors also charged three of his fellow police officers legal analyst elie honig called it an important step toward justice but minnesota attorney general keith ellison warned that winning convictions will be hard hes right honig noted rest assured each defendant will have capable counsel fighting every inch of the way trial juries are inherently unpredictable anybody who tells you any trial is a sure thing has never tried a case holding police officers and their departments responsible for wrongdoing requires surmounting high hurdles when justice fails in the criminal courts theres no guarantee it will succeed in civil lawsuits the supreme courts longstanding qualified immunity doctrine makes it extremely difficult to hold police liable for misdeeds wrote sina kian a former clerk to chief justice john roberts but that could change since the court is weighing whether to hear multiple challenges to the immunity doctrine the court cant fix all of the countrys problems and it certainly cant solve racism kian wrote but it can remove the judge made impediment to accountability that has fueled the problems being protested nows a good time during the obama administration cedric l alexander was asked to serve on a task force on policing which came up with 59 recommendations for improvements under trumps former attorney general jeff sessions the work of the task force and its recommendations were essentially discarded wrote alexander the former public safety director for dekalb county georgia today if a young person of color asks me what they should do if a police officer stops them alexander noted i answer put your hands on the steering wheel where they can be seen cooperate and comply and should they answer me back as they likely would today    even if i did all that we are still getting murdered    i would have nothing to tell him or her with my decades of experience i would have nothing to say the problems we face at this moment are part of our long history but the complete absence of leadership    political moral policy strategic    strikes me as genuinely unprecedented whats the plan now america kevin k mcaleenan served as commissioner of us customs and border protection and acting secretary of the department of homeland security before resigning in 2019 the rage in black communities across the nation he wrote is real and well founded the question is not whether racism in law enforcement exists but how to combat it  there must be commitment to real and sustained reform from within police organizations significant progress has been made over the last two decades in a number of departments all across the country but much much more work remains speaking out on tuesday former president george w bush wrote that he and his wife laura are anguished by the brutal suffocation of george floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country the tragedy he wrote raises a long overdue question how do we end systemic racism in our society that was the moment that law professor dorothy brown said she became convinced that 2020 would be the year serious police reform would become possible bush widely blamed during his presidency for a failure to respond effectively to hurricane katrina in which many african americans died has decided to be on the right side of history  george w bush made the right choice when former defense secretary james mattis published his memoir last year he said im old fashioned i dont write about sitting presidents peter bergen recalled the widely respected retired general threw out that rule this week when he flamed trump in a powerful statement that accused him of spending the past three years dividing america trump has now been on the receiving end of multiple blistering critiques by many of the top retired us military generals and admirals bergen observed as we head closer to november wrote john avlon more center right politicians may start to show spine out of a desire to not get taken down with the rapidly derailing trump train others will come down with cases of convenient amnesia but the military voices already speaking out remind us that protecting our country is a much bigger deal than phony tough fealty to hyper partisan politics conservative commentator scott jennings wrote that the president cannot govern this situation by photo op i was not sure what to make of his march to st johns church across lafayette square as i watched it unfold live on monday i wish he could have taken one step further and stepped into the church and opened the bible he held i wish he had invited faith and civil rights leaders to go there with him and i wish he would have sat in the front row for a church service aimed at praying for peace calm and unity still he wrote when the

images from around the country as thousands protest the brutal killing of george floyd an unarmed black man by a police officer the national fabric is unraveling before our eyes wrote bhagavan and rosenberg americans have looked to our presidents to provide protection meaning and comfort especially in moments of crisis observed david gergen but president trump has gone awol at a time when the us is mourning the covid 19 victims along with the killing of george floyd trumps flight from responsibility is yet another sadness among this weeks tragic losses trump is trailing in the national polls with less than five months to the election his rival former vice president joe biden drew praise for his speech monday from jill filipovic whatever you think of biden    and he wasnt my pick for the democratic nomination    it was almost startling to hear from an empathetic rational adult who understands hes asking to be the publics most prominent servant not its petty disciplinarian she wrote biden promises to listen lead and to try to do right by the whole country not just the angry few who don red hats and shout the loudest at political rallies if this is 1968 all over again wrote joshua zeitz in politico the person who trumps plight summons up is president lyndon b johnson like johnson before him trumps is the party in power    the party that has failed to provide peace prosperity and social order republicans control the executive branch the senate and the supreme court they alone own the chaos rancor and instability that many voters have come to abhor and dread trump campaigns like richard nixon and george wallace but in reality he is lyndon b johnson a man who has lost control of the machine dont miss john sutter reimagining the world after covid karen l

medications he takes to fight cancer also kill his white blood cells which are needed to fight infection and thus he is at special risk from covid 19 so she has a request for people wear a mask in public and observe social distancing wearing a mask isnt political it isnt an encroachment on your freedom it is the most humane decent and selfless act we can do to save humanity from this deadly pandemic not wearing a mask says every man for himself not wearing a mask is the equivalent of a drunk drivers mentality  not wearing a mask says you dont care about my sons life or the lives of the

shelf space to black owned businesses black people make up nearly 15% of the population of the united states according to the most recent census bureau estimates the initiative and online petition were launched last week amid massive demonstrations over the death of george floyd and a national conversation about police brutality and other injustices and inequalities faced by black people in america among those issues are challenges faced by black business owners including a lack of access to capital and a lack of representation at big box retailers it also comes in the wake of the economic crisis caused by coronavirus which disproportionately impacted black workers and business owners the pledge was created by aurora james founder of brooklyn based sustainable fashion brand brother vellies so many of your businesses are built on black spending power james said in a may 29 instagram post so many of your stores are set up in black communities so many of your sponsored posts are seen on black feeds this is the least you can do for us dozens of major us corporations released statements and made donations last week in light of the protests but many say that these one time moves are not enough to address the structural inequality that exists in corporate america oftentimes theres a lot of motion but very little action from companies in response to calls for racial justice said john harmon a member of the us chamber of commerce committee tasked with correcting the inequality of opportunity in an interview with cnn last week harmon has proposed a corporate scorecard on racial inequality the 15% pledge website specifically calls on sephora target tgt whole foods and clothing retailer shopbop to take the pledge the four companies did not return requests for comment on how much of their shelf space is currently dedicated to black owned businesses and whether they would consider taking the pledge in a statement posted to instagram last week shopbop said the inequitable and brutal treatment of black people must stop shopbop stands in solidarity with the black community \u2014 our employees our customers and our partners \u2014 in the fight against systemic racism and injustice in an open letter sephora ceo jean andr\u00e9 rougeot outlined steps the company is taking to challenge prejudice and bias including creating an employee training program focused on mitigating bias and driving positive behavioral change in all stores the company also said it raised more than $1 million for the national black justice coalition through its corporate giving program and by allowing customers to turn rewards points into donations target on friday announced several steps it is taking which include making a $10 million donation to organizations including the national urban league and the african american leadership forum it is also providing 10000 hours of pro bono consulting to twin cities businesses owned by people of color to help with rebuilding efforts amazon which owns whole foods pledged $10 million to organizations promoting justice and equity including black lives matter and the naacp while such donation numbers may look large from a consumers perspective the 15% pledge points out that the commitment in many cases is a small fraction of companies total income and executives total pay target for example posted nearly $33 billion in net income last year and the companys $10 million donation is less than half of the $216 million target ceo brian cornell made during the 2019 fiscal year much of which came from previously issued restricted stock awards and beyond corporate donations the 15% pledge could put money directly into the hands of black business owners and help build generational wealth in black communities whole foods if you were to sign on to this pledge it could immediately drive support to black farmers james said in an instagram post banks will be forced to take them seriously because they will be walking in with major purchase orders from whole foods investors for the very first time will start actively seeking them out  real investment will start happening in black businesses which will subsequently be paid forward into our black communities the pledge asks companies to take stock of how much business they currently give to black owned businesses and suppliers to share that information publicly and then to increase that number to 15% the world is now asking you to question the barriers to entry support systems hiring practices assumptions and fundamental prejudices that got you to the numbers that we are asking you to share and change an instagram post from the initiative reads thoughtful and deliberate transparency with your customers and employees is the first and biggest signifier that you are ready to embark on the path of meaningful change   cnns cristina alesci contributed to this report "

investors the point of venture capital is to make bets on the future said dan wang associate professor of management at columbia business school and there are some obvious industries that have attracted more venture capital during the pandemic e commerce is one of those industries pandemic shopping includes more pajama purchases lots of online orders for alcohol and of course groceries its also worth looking at how people are spending their time online not just their money while golf basketball hockey and other sports all suspended their seasons esports kept operating some gaming companies including the electronic sports league the worlds largest esports organizer told cnn business in march they were seeing continued or increased interest from broadcasters and advertisers the conversations that might have been hot but not yet closed are getting closed quicker craig levine global chief strategy officer of the electronic sports league known as esl told cnn business in march people that we havent spoken to in a while our phones are starting to ring a little bit from them as theyre getting intrigued by what were able to offer them in april esl announced a three year deal with amazon owned livestreaming giant twitch to exclusively stream competitions on the platform gaming has emerged as a winner from weddings and graduation ceremonies to classes people have taken the extra time they have indoors to meet up online the gig economy as the nation starts to recover from massive unemployment rates the new normal may usher in a shift away from full time jobs to side hustles and multiple gigs experts predict a lot of small businesses even if they are squarely situated in the physical world are going to see the digital channel as a source of resilience said arun sundararajan a business professor at new york university and author of the sharing economy for asian americans who have faced higher rates of unemployment than any other group the road to recovery appears troubling during the 2008 recession asian americans had the highest long term unemployment of any group according to a 2012 study from marlene kim a professor of economics at the university of massachusetts boston who predicts it now will happen again im going to predict that this is going to happen again kim told cnn business i think it was part discrimination but also part other people dropped out of the labor market they didnt even look for jobs but asians kept looking for jobs and being counted as unemployed the creative ways people have found could change which businesses are left in the future and how they operate nail salons are mailing fake nails to customers and some unemployed individuals are turning to online gigs like coaching video games one result may be that even though we will undoubtedly lose many in person businesses we may have a more robust on  and off line landscape of experiences and businesses available after the pandemic said jane desmond professor of anthropology and gender and womens studies at the university of illinois at urbana champaign a lasting culture of hustling kala yoga studio in brooklyn new york is struggling after shutting its doors three weeks after its opening day in february since the owner kate sullivan began offering online classes on march 17 sullivan said they the studio has had revenue of $11500 but has lost about $26000 for expenses that include rent utilities and software services just today i wrote to my landlord to just basically beg for a rent concession for the next five months because we have an impossibility of performance right now sullivan told cnn business in late may she said other yoga studios have noticed a drop off in attendance too i think people are just getting depressed and less motivated and i think people are also on zoom for work and theyre just like i cant be on another computer screen right now as people keep hustling they might find themselves taking clients away from the very businesses they work for sullivan said some of her employees are doing just that i dont begrudge my teachers for it because i mean everybody has to do what they have to do to survive she said "

as good condoleezza rice and her path to power and white bucks and black eyed peas coming of age black in white america the views in this commentary are his own view more opinion columns at cnn remember when black lives matter was still considered a controversial thing to say on friday roger goodell the commissioner of the national football league responded to the demands of black nfl players and spoke out against racism we the national football league admit we were wrong for not listening to nfl players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest goodell said we the nfl believe black lives matter it may be mind boggling to think that that was once a controversial phrase but it was just two weeks ago what changed thats what one of my 10 year olds asked when i explained what all the press coverage was about in the two weeks since george floyd died at the hands of the minneapolis police white people have joined swelling protests across the country demanding an end to systemic racism former president george w bush issued a statement acknowledging that white supremacy is alive and well in america and we need to kill it the doctrine and habits of racial superiority which once nearly split our country still threaten our union symbols that have been the source of racial pain for generations and of intense debate for decades are suddenly being removed confederate statues confederate flags and sambos restaurant i told my son that i thought technology made a difference now that there are cell phone videos of african americans being senselessly killed by the police more white people seem to believe it happens people around the world have watched the graphic video that showed a white police officer kneeling on floyds neck as floyd said i cant breathe millions witnessed his body going limp as bystanders urged the police to stop pinning floyd to the ground floyds death was also just one in a string of several others ahmaud arbery was killed while jogging in what his lawyer says is being investigated as a federal hate crime breonna taylor who would have been 27 on friday was an emergency medical technician killed in her own apartment in louisville kentucky by police officers executing a no knock search warrant these devastating losses came off the back of a global pandemic which disproportionally took black lives african americans and other marginalized communities suffer disproportionately from the health conditions that can make a covid 19 diagnosis fatal and from longtime inequities in healthcare george floyd was also one of millions of people who lost their jobs in the economic upheaval caused by the virus still innocent black people have died at the hands of police before and countless other videos have gone viral even my 10 year old son who knew these facts seemed baffled by the white world suddenly awakening to his reality and that is the debate among african americans is this a paroxysm of outrage that will fade like so many social trends before it or is it really possible that we could be living through a moment of fundamental societal change as both former president barack obama and rev al sharpton have noted things feel different this time around why white people now seem less inclined to debate whether there is racism in america as the majority have for most of my life they are demanding that it end white people now seem less likely to question whether there is police brutality as most have my entire life they are simply demanding it end im reminded of south africa in the years leading up to nelson mandelas release from prison in 1990 after serving 27 years i also see glimmers of the american civil rights movement  in the 1960s the abuse of african americans in the south and the outrage over it led to real change including the end of jim crow and the disenfranchisement of black people along with the extension of the rule of law to include all americans but the mistreatment and murder of black people had been going on for nearly 200 years of american democracy and centuries before independence what changed during the civil rights movement was white peoples tolerance of this mistreatment it was white outrage that led to change in the past week every company that i have a relationship with has sent emails affirming their commitment to the fight against racism that includes banks software companies childrens camps and appliance stores everyone from homemakers to former presidents are saying white supremacy must end people are marching in the great cities of the united states as well as the tiny towns and protesters have shown their support from sydney to bratislava the changes in south africa and the american south required a change of heart in white people this new fight against racism will require the support of white people too if our eyes and ears are to be believed many are now stepping up to the plate and demanding it of themselves and their neighbors will that demand for change be enduring will it sweep away inequities from the classroom to the boardroom to the newsroom the first time i told my twins the story of how the united states became a nation they were five years old as the three of us sat in a new york playground i cried as i told them about a rabble of farmers and workers who took on the greatest empire in the world and against all odds won years later i told them the story of slavery later still i told them about jim crow they know all that now the son i was talking to about george floyd had just finished a fifth grade paper on the rule of law through us history he had chosen as his topic sentence the rule of law or equality before the law is a part of our society however it is a lie  he handed in his final draft on may 28 three days after george floyd had died its understandable that african americans    some as young as 10    are skeptical that our nation will live up to its promise of equality these are not systems and institutions that are easily changed and the trauma of 400 years of soul destroying racism is not easily forgotten    some researchers believe it is imprinted in our very dna and were all too cognizant  of the dashed promises of the past from liberation to reconstruction to the civil rights movement but change does come history teaches us that it came to south africa it came to the american south is this our moment dare we believe it "

hearty mexican egg dish machaca con huevos kept families satisfied all morning long by adding dried shredded beef to a mixture of eggs onions tomatoes and chile peppers it was a traditional breakfast in nuevo le\u00f3n and chihuahua in northern mexico    cattle country    and a way to use the beef jerky farmers made to preserve meat before the days of refrigeration today machaca can be found in

passover when jews abstain from eating leavened baked goods matzo brei is made from crumbled matzo unleavened flatbread soaked in water and then beaten with eggs this mixture is then fried and served

be some fable embedded into the origin of the dish and the name said to mean hunger killer but its appearance alone makes it stand out in a sea of brunch staples in short matambre is thin flank steak rolled with vegetables and hard boiled eggs then grilled or braised the final step of slicing this meat roll gives it a photogenic cross section appearance onsen tamago japan imagine sinking into a

chinese and italian versions on this list its a thicker concoction of chicken broth rice or orzo egg and lemon and while its best known today as a greek dish it has both iberian and jewish roots and

served on president barack obamas national security council from 2009 to 2013 and at the treasury department under president george w bush follow her @sam_vinograd the views expressed in this commentary are her own view more opinion articles on cnn in washington dc alone there has been a dizzying array of security personnel deployed in the last few days from members of the military to dc police to the us bureau of prisons the streets have become an alphabet soup of acronyms when it comes to law enforcement and security personnel all designated    by various levels of government    to seemingly promote safety but as americans countrywide exercise their constitutional right to protest peacefully unnecessary assaults on democratic freedoms and civil liberties have proliferated amid the tear gas and rubber bullets a dangerous trump trend has arisen while dc police are required by law to wear badges unidentified federal law enforcement officials have been caught on camera with no badges no identifying information and with large firearms some refused to identify themselves or reportedly gave ambiguous answers after being called out publicly for their unattributable presence federal bureau of prisons director michael carvajal has said that while bureau of prisons staffers dont typically need to identify themselves because they operate within the confines of our institution he probably should have had those in dc wearing some identification  if this happened anywhere but here the us would be issuing strongly worded white house and state department statements and reviewing other policy options to deter and punish this behavior going forward  unmarked officers and secret police have been used in authoritarian crackdowns throughout history we used to refer to russian president vladimir putins unidentified proxies during his annexation of crimea as little green men for wearing unmarked green uniforms unattributable shows of force just shouldnt happen in american democracy theyre dangerous on many levels both in the near and longer term  from a safety perspective the videos and images of unidentified federal law enforcement personnel standing    heavily armed    in the nations capital could have led to immediate security problems it was    and is    counterproductive to have unidentified law enforcement personnel standing in the streets without accreditation or badges of any kind it is hard for anyone to know whether they have authority to conduct law enforcement missions how would protesters or anyone these personnel may seek to question search or even arrest be aware they have the power to take such action  the failure to clearly and credibly identify all federal law enforcement personnel also creates a heightened security risk with armed americans showing up at protests the lack of identification makes it far too easy for vigilantes either to blend in with the law enforcement officers or spuriously claim authority they dont have its confusing and potentially dangerous for americans exercising their constitutional rights and for other military and law enforcement officers trying to distinguish private citizens from security personnel a heavily armed officer in tactical gear with no clearly identifying insignia is nearly indistinguishable from a militia member trying to terrorize peaceful protestors  plus while attorney general william barr defended the fact that some federal personnel may not have identified themselves the failure to identify federal law enforcement personnel endangers accountability if there need to be investigations into their actions it is much easier to act with impunity if theres no fear of attribution a law enforcement officers shield or badge connotes authority but also helps to ensure responsible behavior  recognizing the risks associated with this trump trend house speaker nancy pelosi has sent a letter to the president asking for an accounting of the full list of agencies involved and clarification on their roles and responsibilities democratic sen chris murphy and senate minority leader chuck schumer have introduced draft legislation that would require federal law enforcement personnel and members of the military to identify themselves as such  but so far the law and order president    and the attorney general    seem satisfied with unattributable law enforcement personnel roaming our streets despite the fact that such actions threaten to undermine our law and order so far the law and order president is ok with bureau of prisons personnel positioning themselves with no identifiable information in close proximity to americans exercising their constitutional rights    or the fact that ag barr authorized them to make arrests  instead the president seems to be focused on using all law enforcement and security personnel    no matter their specific training rules of engagement jurisdiction or the time they were given to get themselves safely ready to deploy to dc    in a brute show of force this doesnt advance law and order it undermines it how ironic    and hypocritical    that a president who has tried to depict himself as a victim of out of control law enforcement would now appear to champion agents of the state acting with impunity it is unfortunately just the latest reminder that this president wants law and order on his terms and his terms only "

director of the monroe media group a washington dc based media strategy crisis communication and personal branding firm the views expressed in this commentary are his own view more opinion at cnn we cant jog and be black we cant barbecue and be black we cant bird watch and be black we cant sleep in our bed and be black we cant even sit in our own car and be black not safely anyway as a black man as the son and grandson and great grandson of black men as a father of a black teenager ive known the fear i can trigger among white people i know that for many when they see my skin they can see a loaded cocked weapon for black people our melanin is probable cause this is our truth and theres not a thing we can do about that but white people can for most white people the violence that happens to blacks in america has too often been a headline on facebook to scroll past a twitter video to watch a morning show news clip sandwiched between a cooking segment and the weather it is something they know exists but rarely affects their day to day lives until minneapolis watching the white police officer in that city press his knee against the neck of george floyd for 8 minutes and 46 seconds until he died was just too much for many white americans to handle and seeing the three other cops stand by during the killing    that was just too much to handle white people across america and around the world were disgusted as they should have been but just a short while earlier we had learned about ahmaud arbery allegedly hunted down by three white men \u2014 one a former law enforcement officer he was first hit with a truck and then shot dead as he was jogging in georgia according to a georgia bureau of investigation agent testifying thursday at a preliminary hearing prosecutors say he was executed there was also the case of breonna taylor a 26 year old medical worker \u2014 a black woman \u2014 shot at least eight times and killed in an attempted drug sting by plainclothes officers who burst in while she was asleep in her bed in kentucky and christian cooper a harvard trained biomedical editor had the new york city police called on him while bird watching by a frightened white woman in central park after he asked her to follow the law and put her dog on a leash black people have lived with this kind of treatment every day for years for centuries but now more white people are paying attention as will smith said racism is not getting worse its getting filmed white people this one is on yall between the coronavirus pandemic and the lethal police violence this has been a rough few weeks for black america it has set in stark relief how little of this is within our control we mostly are not the cops on the street we mostly are not the ceos in the board rooms we mostly arent the voters electing the prosecutors and judges were not sitting at the dinner tables with the mildly racist cousins and uncles and in laws who are snickered at or just tolerated this week has shown how much of what has been happening    and how many of the things that must change    are on the white majority you have the real power you are in the positions of authority if this has really affected you at your core you can actually change white culture from the inside we cant i hope this moment is a real wake up call for white people for our allies and that they stay awake because thats where the only real change can come from theres just not much more we    black and brown people    can do except try not to get shot each day and hope i had to tell my then 15 year old son as a white female maryland national capital park police officer was pulling us over when we took our exit off the 495 beltway to keep his hands in plain sight and his mouth shut while i tried to figure out why we were being stopped oh no you werent speeding the officer told me while shining her flashlight in my face with her left hand as her right hand hovered over her holster you just looked out of place so i ran your plates and your smog certificate just expired youd better get that fixed smog certificate really turns out our only crime was that we were two black men driving in a mercedes benz s430 in suburban dc and that was not worth getting shot over but i am hopeful millions and millions of white people in america were    at their core    disgusted and embarrassed by the george floyd murder they knew in their gut that it was wrong and not the america they want to live in many also know at least intellectually that these kinds of episodes happen frequently to people of color even if most are not shown tv and social media and some have taken to the streets this week to join    and in some cases lead    the protests they are there on the front lines doing something about it that gives me hope but its not enough this is the time for white people to actively challenge their uncles their co workers their drinking buddies    those they know who are either actively racist or passively indifferent to what happens in their communities and often on their behalf every day it is time to make them uncomfortable they need to accept that there are thousands of george floyd episodes that happen all the time across this country that dont get captured on someones cell phone episodes that end up as an afterthought on a doctored police report the suspect resisted arrest or responding officers believed the suspect was reaching for a weapon the good cops    and yes many are good cops    need to actively check call out and turn in their colleagues in the precinct or the locker room and they know exactly who they are who they know should never be allowed to use deadly force to satisfy their power trips and the police unions need to take a leadership role in purging their ranks of those officers and they know exactly who they are they know have no business wielding a gun and a badge in todays society we have seen scores of public companies \u2014 from uber to peloton to postmates \u2014 release statements of support proclaiming they too believe black lives matter while that support is appreciated the next question is what else are you going to do about it if you look at companies top management their senior leadership their boards of directors do you see many people of color no well what are you going to do about it when you look at who your top vendors are who you hire as outside counsel as your accountants as your consultants are you doing business with black and brown owned companies so right now what can you do about it as a start you can open yourself up to our daily reality listen \u2014 with your mouths closed and your hearts open \u2014 as your black friends talk about what they deal with every day yes we can help you become aware but we cant help you understand read great works like white fragility why its so hard for white people to talk about racism by anti racist educator robin diangelo or dr martin luther kings letter from a birmingham jail or just do a twitter search for the hashtag #whitepeopleshomework white people this one is on you you are in the positions of power you are the ones who can be the change dont let this opportunity slip by america needs you to step up "

        "text": "james c moore is a political analyst communications consultant and author he has been living in texas and writing on the states politics and history since 1975 the views expressed in this commentary are his own view more opinion on cnn of all the institutions the trump presidency is harming its likely no one suspected the republican national convention might be one of them but president donald trumps refusal to fully acknowledge the risks associated with the pandemic is creating a new political threat to his own candidacy the republican national convention was slated to take place in charlotte north carolina in august but the pandemic struck and the governor has insisted on a scaled down event with safety precautions that include social distancing and face masks the president who wants his huddled masses shoulder to shoulder as they shout their acclimations is now looking to deliver his convention speech in another city more formal portions of the convention may still be held in charlotte in order to honor the rncs contractual agreement with the city if trump insists on a bifurcated convention he might fatally wound his reelection campaign north carolina is a critical swing state and voters there may resent being overlooked the change could also leave an impression that the campaign is disorganized and indecisive at a time when the electorate is already faced with critical questions about the presidents ability to lead the rnc has a plan though sort of getting a political party and a city ready to host a convention is a long and tedious process for republicans especially the convention has in recent years been held in swing states which may help influence voters with a boost to the local economy given the millions that go into hotels restaurants and venues conventions can generate the kind of exposure and tourism that marketing dollars cannot buy but what exactly does a split city republican convention look like even the platform and policy wonk gatherings in charlotte might be endangered because the rnc communications director has indicated his party will only convene should the governor allow more than 10 people in a room since the president is planning on delivering his speech to an adoring crowd in another city the attendant publicity for charlotte will likely be about the scaled back event and what the gop lost by having to adapt to the coronavirus as well as trumps demands for the queen city this means not all publicity will be good publicity and now another gop site selection committee is crossing the country considering new locations that include dallas nashville phoenix orlando jacksonville and las vegas so where should the rnc go arizona usually a red state may not be this election cycle the partys us senate candidate martha mcsally has seen her campaign against former astronaut mark kelly almost sink beneath the earth a recent fox news poll found she trailed the democrat by 13 points while joe biden is leading trump by four points in the grand canyon state hosting a convention in 105 degree weather in phoenix is not likely to change those numbers while las vegas and nashville have adequate facilities nevada and tennessee dont carry all that many electoral votes orlando or jacksonville could host the speech and florida is a must win but being in the geographic center of the country might help trump get the crowd he wants texas location allows for shorter travel distances which increase the likelihood of attendance and dallas is probably the best strategic choice for trump polling shows texas emerging as a swing state with the president leading his democratic opponent by only one point according to a quinnipiac poll conventional thinking refuses to acknowledge the lone star state can be won by democrats in 2020 latino voters historically have had the lowest turnout of any demographic group in the state and until they vote in greater numbers winning texas will be difficult for democrats but the gop is scared    and losing texas will put the white house out of reach this loss could have lasting ramifications and the gop could take an entire generation to learn how to win the support of an increasingly diverse electorate but texas still has big money and trump backers like arch conservative gov greg abbott who has never publicly criticized the president dollars and sycophancy will be in great supply if the rnc holds the nominating vote and speech in dallas texas is almost a trump petri dish to grow political absurdities abbott has the states indicted attorney general fighting legal battles to prevent voting by mail and to end obamacare tax collections have cratered with the price of oil and tourism has plummeted during the pandemic but a big moment in dallas might give state politicians a chance to claim were back even if its not the whole truth no matter where the rnc goes next there is a looming question will trump damage his support in north carolina after charlottes leadership spent two years planning the convention and the estimated $120 million dollar windfall it offers it is not a minor historical irony that the last time a presidential nominating convention was split between two cities the decision was informed by race southern democrats in 1860 walked out of their convention in charleston south carolina in a dispute over the partys platform on slavery when the party reconvened in baltimore northern and southern democrats split and republican abraham lincoln went on to win the election before eventually signing the emancipation proclamation issues of race 160 years later will also influence the coming election along with the pandemic and a flagging economy trump and the gop may have made their chances of success considerably more challenging by adding uncertainty to their plans with an unorthodox split convention history might be hinting it plans on repeating itself but trump is not the type to listen

        "text": "timothy denevi is the author of freak kingdom hunter s thompsons manic ten year crusade against american fascism and a professor of creative writing at george mason university the views expressed here are solely the authors view more opinion articles on cnn fifty two years ago this weekend robert f kennedy then the junior senator from new york and a leading candidate for the democratic presidential nomination died in los angeles the victim of a political assassination ive been looking again at the final months of his life which were largely shaped by the murder of martin luther king jr the words he spoke the night of april 4 1968 when king was assassinated and in the days following feel tailor made for own moment in 2020 and his efforts at guidance as a presidential candidate during those weeks leading up to his own death on june 6 bring into stark relief the stunning dereliction of leadership shown in 2020 by president donald trump if theres one thing kennedy couldnt stand it was the sort of person who spoke to the basest instincts in the human condition those bullies willing to play up our divisions for personal gain it could be a small town sheriff or the president of the united states such narrow mindedness as he said the week before kings assassination ran contrary to the deepest and most dominant impulses of the american character the only way to fight them off was to use what they lacked integrity truth and honorgenerosity and compassion the traits that he believed could bring even the most disparate of us together on the night of kings death kennedy broke the news to a large crowd of predominantly black supporters in downtown indianapolis martin luther king dedicated his life to love and to justice for his fellow human beings he said for those of you who are black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and distrust at the injustice of such an act against all white people i can only say that i feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling then for the first and only time in his life he opened up publicly about his own brothers murder in dallas four years earlier i had a member of my family killed but he was killed by a white man but we have to make an effort in the united states we have to make an effort to understand to go beyond these difficult times he quoted aeschyluss the oresteia a passage from the greek tragedy about the acceptance and wisdom that can only be gained over time through the awful grace of god in surrender what we need in the united states is not division he was speaking extemporaneously without notes his voice low and halting what we need in the united states is not division what we need is not hatred what we need in the united states is not violence or lawlessness but love and wisdom and compassion toward one another and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country whether they be white or they be black he talked just under five minutes so i shall ask you tonight to return home he concluded to say a prayer for the family of martin luther king but more importantly to say a prayer for our country which all of us love and that was exactly what happened in indianapolis when he was finished the thousands in the crowd headed home riots were breaking out in washington dc and chicago but in indianapolis there wouldnt be violence it was in retrospect one of the most astonishing performances in american history and over the next two weeks as fires and looting swept through more than a hundred american cities hed continue in his role as the countrys impromptu voice of reconciliation the closest thing to what we so clearly seem to lack today a leader with the capacity to clarify our pain in all its uncomfortable dimensions he was terrified of what might happen to this country if such raw and deeply felt pain was left to fester it would open the door of the american system to a leader who embodied the worst in us someone willing to go so far as to openly call upon what kennedy described that spring as the darker impulses of the american spirit its a haunting description one that after what happened this week in lafayette square in washington dc where hundreds of unarmed protesters were gassed and beaten in clashes with federal law enforcement as they cleared the space on the explicit orders of president trumps attorney general william barr \u2014 feels more urgent than ever punishment is not prevention as he continued to campaign for the presidency after kings assassination kennedy asked his audiences to stop and consider why a young man would feel compelled to burn down his own neighborhood which he characterized as a destructive and self defeating attempt to assert his worth and dignity as a human being he questioned the police and national guards brutality asserting that punishment is not prevention and at almost every stop from one campaign event to the next he turned the conversation to the complicity that white americans by ignoring their own roles in the perpetuation of the systemic injustice tearing the country apart bore for the recent violence there is another kind of violence he explained the violence of institutions indifference and inaction and slow decay at the heart of his perspective was a stark if simple premise when vulnerable americans suffer we all do whenever any americans life is taken by another american unnecessarily he said the morning after martin luther kings death the whole nation is degraded it certainly feels that way today more than half a century later how could the recent killing of george floyd \u2014 a black man who died under the knee of a white police officer in minneapolis after begging for his life \u2014 be characterized as anything other than a degradation an enduring unforgivable shame burning in the countrys soul a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong but as kennedy also reminded us in the weeks after kings assassination anger and fury no matter how righteous means nothing without accountability violence breeds violence he said repression brings retaliation he asked from us what he believed we should all be demanding to see in him the question is whether we can find in our midst and in our hearts that leadership of humane purpose that will recognize the terrible truths of our existence on this note he had no patience for liars it was why hed thrown his hat into the ring for the presidency in the first place he couldnt stand by while more and more americans continued to die in vietnam while lyndon johnson lied about victory being just around the corner and refused to cut his losses a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong and repairs the evils he said that march the only sin is pride this was rfk in 1968 he hadnt always talked this way of course since the start of the decade hed come a long way especially on racial and economic justice he was shaped \u2014 painfully against his will \u2014 by tragedy the loss of his beloved older brother and everything theyd spend their adult lives creating afterward it unearthed in him a sensitivity that might otherwise have remained dormant and the final ingredient it seems was martin luther king jrs horrific assassination from here on jules witcover would write in 85 days the private robert kennedy that his closest friends professed him to be \u2014 not the strident not the bombastic but the low keyed and sensitive \u2014 increasingly emerged in his public life as a campaigner at last he was the person hed spent his life becoming \u2014 the most fully realized version of himself there wouldnt be the chance to become another after 52 years more injustice two months after kings murder on the night he won the all important california primary kennedy was shot at point blank range with a 22 caliber revolver by sirhan bishara sirhan a 24 year old pasadena resident of palestinian descent who for weeks had been writing in his notebook rfk must die it was ostensibly for supporting israel the fatal bullet struck him just below his right ear still for 15 astonishing minutes he somehow remained alert is everybody okay he asked when his wife ethel arrived he caught her glance gazing back at last a pair of medical attendants arrived lifting him without warning onto their stretcher oh no no no he whispered please dont move me then he lost consciousness the next day \u2014 june 6 1968 \u2014 he was dead this week despite my best efforts i keep thinking about bobby kennedy and george floyd    by looking without sentimentality at the final moments in their equally abbreviated lives both were in agonizing pain both were terrified both were conscious of what was happening to them and at the same time helpless to stop it in their final horrific moments the only thing left for them to understand was suffering its all consuming degradation no one deserves to die violently in america the injustice is that 52 years later it takes so much to remind us of exactly that "

        "text": "an end to copycat buildings and a ban on skyscrapers taller than 500 meters 1640 feet are among the chinese governments new guidelines for architects property developers and urban planners outlining what it calls a new era for chinas cities a circular issued by the countrys housing ministry and the national development and reform commission earlier this year also proposes other sweeping measures to ensure buildings embody the spirit of their surroundings and highlight chinese characteristics with height restrictions already being implemented in places like beijing and a 2016 government directive calling for the end to oversized xenocentric weird buildings the guidelines appear to formalize changes that were already underway but according to chinese architecture experts some of the less eye catching suggestions    such as an appeal for heritage protection a credit system for designers and the appointment of chief architects    may signal a subtler evolution in the way chinas cities are planned the document is really not just about height said li shiqiao a professor of asian architecture at the university of virginia in a phone interview its about chinese culture the urban context the spirit of the city and the appearance of modernity this has been in the academic discussion a lot but somehow not in a government document until now cut down to size of the 10 completed buildings measuring above 500 meters around the world half are found in mainland china among them are the planets second tallest skyscraper the twisting shanghai tower at 632 meters 2073 feet tall and shenzhens ping an finance center which is 599 meters 1965 feet from base to tip in the last two years theyve been joined by beijings citic tower and the tianjin ctf finance center the worlds seventh and ninth tallest buildings respectively but the tide against soaring skyscrapers has been turning for some time the number of new buildings measuring 200 meters 656 feet or above in china fell by almost 40% last year according to construction data from the council on tall buildings and urban habitat ctbuh in beijings downtown central business district a height restriction was already being applied to new proposals    a cap of just 180 meters 591 feet according to a 2018 report by property firm jones lang lasalle elsewhere in the country the wuhan greenland center had its projected height cut from 636 meters 2087 feet to under 500    a decision made in 2018 after construction began necessitating a significant redesign    with local media citing airspace regulations the suzhou hungnam center has since had its planned height cut from 729 meters 2392 feet to 499 meters 1637 feet with upcoming skyscrapers in the cities of chengdu and shenyang also suffering the same fate according to state run tabloid global times fei chen a senior architecture professor at the uks liverpool university described the 500 meter limit as quite arbitrary adding that skyscrapers measuring 499 meters are still very very tall buildings but the new document confirms growing intolerance for buildings that are out of scale or out of context she said chen also pointed to official concern around the reckless use of tall buildings whereby expensive and unprofitable towers are used by real estate firms to brand their developments    or by local governments to put their cities on the map the guidelines respond to the identity crisis that weve all noticed since the 1980s when cities started to borrow standards and building types from international contexts she said in a phone interview and since the 1990s cities have been promoted as being competitive in the market through the construction of landmarks and large public buildings as such the new restrictions are as much about economics as design above a certain height the cost of constructing skyscrapers increases exponentially with each additional floor chinas skylines are now littered with unfinished towers as economic growth slows and developers face a squeeze on credit according to ctbuh data around 70 chinese buildings that were meant to stand above 200 meters are currently on hold having already started construction three of them were expected to measure over 500 meters including tianjins soaring goldin finance 117 which broke ground over a decade ago wuhans aforementioned greenland center has stood unfinished and largely untouched since 2017 despite having its planned height reduced in lis view the governments new measures epitomize a new paradigm for chinese cities    one less reliant on marketable skyscrapers and speculative financing to illustrate the shift he compares shanghais pudong district the soaring financial quarter that rose from almost nothing in the last two decades to xiongan a brand new city being built 100 kilometers southwest of beijing unlike pudong the new 25 million person satellite city will be relatively low rise with its property market subjected to tight state controls if you take pudong as the paradigm for chinese urbanization from 2000 to today then you look at xiongan    which is not dominated by real estate speculation or iconic buildings    as the new paradigm  then thats quite an amazing change were witnessing a new framework yet li maintains that the 500 meter height restriction is from an academic standpoint probably the least interesting part of the new government guidelines elsewhere the circular contains a range of other measures including the prohibition of plagiarism imitation and copycat behavior chinas very own eiffel tower and a london inspired thames town outside shanghai are two of the more extreme    and ridiculed    examples of how imitation architecture thrived in the 2000s this official shift again may simply reflect the changing design culture in china but an explicit ban on plagiarism could nonetheless prove useful in a country where the degree of quality is so diverse chen said theres already an acknowledgment in the architecture industry that copying is not welcome she said but china is huge and some cities are doing better than others in east coast cities or more developed areas architects have better design skills so they produce better buildings but in inland cities you still see buildings that copy others styles or architectural languages and that doesnt result in very good design the government document also proposes a credit system    and conversely a blacklist    for architects to encourage compliance with planning laws and regulations it warns against demolishing historical buildings traditional architecture or even old trees to make way for new developments a move in keeping with the growing emphasis placed on heritage preservation in china two shanghai art museums created from disused industrial oil tanks and an old power station are among the recent high profile renovation projects in a country once known for indiscriminately razing old structures but one of the governments new suggestions proposes something entirely new in china chief architects for each city moscow and barcelona are among cities that already appoint an individual to approve or veto new proposals li welcomed the idea as a way to ensure designs fit the overall urban context the hesitation is whether ensuring uniformity means that a city becomes predictable and uninteresting or whether you actually sustain some degree of creativity he added but we have a new generation of chinese designers that is great at both maintaining the urban fabric and creating very interesting architecture the key is instituting a system that guarantees that process how    or even whether    the governments more exploratory suggestions come to fruition remains to be seen the new guidelines provide a broad framework for cities but finer details must be resolved at a local level said chen whose research focuses on urban governance in china characterizing the circular as a series of red lines not to be crossed more donts than dos she also suggested that work is still required to positively articulate what constitutes good design there are policies and documents talking about what you shouldnt do which is a good thing but theyve never said what you should do she explained architects and urban designers may benefit from quite specific guidance on what good design is but this needs to be related to the local context so i wouldnt expect the national government to produce guidance like this what works in one context may not work in another"

        "text": "when news broke months ago about the countrys first coronavirus outbreak at a nursing home linda mayberry immediately recognized the homes corporate logo as it flashed across her television screen it was the same one emblazoned throughout the long term care facility where she lived her nursing home she realized was owned by the same company struggling to curtail a rising death toll in kirkland washington mayberry began to dread what would happen if coronavirus swept through her building soon after this discovery her facility in bellflower california instituted a lockdown in march barring all visitors to try to keep the disease out mayberry spent her days alone in her room before the pandemic she passed the time watching hours of classic movies but now as the black and white films played in the background she scoured the internet for news about what was happening in the outside world at first few local governments released information about how covid 19 was ravaging the vulnerable populations residing in nursing homes but as data started coming out mayberry saw that the deaths in other facilities were skyrocketing and then in mid april she said she learned from staff that a resident somewhere in the building had tested positive for the disease since the early days of the pandemic nursing homes have been hit particularly hard    grappling with supply shortages and accounting for tens of thousands of deaths but it is difficult to know what is actually happening inside these facilities as measures aimed at protecting residents from the spread of the disease have left them even more vulnerable and closed off from the public they have been locked away from friends and family routine government inspections have been severely limited due to the virus and some employees fear retaliation for raising concerns it is even more rare to hear from the residents themselves    since many suffer from dementia and other debilitating conditions or dont have an outlet to share their stories mayberry now 66 said she felt that local government officials werent doing enough to protect residents in nursing homes she knew many of her fellow residents didnt have the ability to speak out but she had an ipad and a twitter account so she began sending dispatches from the inside of her room and hoped that someone would see them as a nursing home resident i feel as though i am in #deathcamp2020 and we just got our first #covid19 case 2 days ago she wrote on april 12 no testing for staff or patients please help us *** mayberry never envisioned spending the early years of her retirement in a nursing home she had a nearly 40 year career at a local school district working as a computer technician and retired in 2015 only to develop a dangerous skin infection she said then she said she suffered a broken leg and shattered ankle from a fall during her recovery the injuries ultimately left her bedridden as she attempted to find a way to pay for the surgery she would need she was single with no kids and her brother lived hundreds of miles away in oregon because she needed full time care mayberry resorted to becoming a paying patient at the nursing home bel tooren villa convalescent hospital owned by the national chain life care centers of america she had a surgery scheduled for the end of march that she hoped would finally enable her to move back into the home she owns in long beach only around 15 minutes from her facility but then coronavirus hit mayberry has always been outspoken in earlier years she wrote letters to the editor of her local newspaper opposing the renaming of her childhood park and criticizing the stock obituary of a local woman and classic film actress saying she deserved much better and she was already active on twitter before the pandemic criticizing president donald trump and sharing her love of old cinema with her modest list of 200 something followers which includes a small stable of movie buffs the official twitter account for the los angeles city attorney became a follower more recently after mayberry saw a tweet about a price gouging investigation and responded with a photo of the same bottle of hand sanitizer being sold for $80 that still had its $199 price tag now as she learned from several of the nurses taking care of her that a growing number of employees and fellow residents were also testing positive for the virus she said she made it her mission to draw attention to people like her who are stuck in nursing homes where the coronavirus is spreading related covid 19 is ravaging nursing homes government records show why in some cases she replied directly to tweets from government officials and journalists in others she simply offered dispatches of what her life was like detailing the outrage and frustration she was feeling she didnt know if anyone was seeing them but it made her feel like she was doing something i could scream to the four walls here but they dont listen very well she said mayberry tweeted about how she spent weeks asking to be tested    and how it finally happened last month a nurse showed up in her room in protective gear several days after her 66th birthday to deliver the news she was positive for the virus and needed to be moved to the isolation unit    which mayberry described as starting with a hallway of the facility blocked off by a thick layer of plastic that hung from the ceiling to floor but growing to take over a large part of the building keeping the sick here and not testing the staff was a recipe for disaster she told cnn in late may i am really pissed off this didnt have to happen when staff at her nursing home discovered that she had been publicly voicing concerns about the situation she said she was grilled by a corporate bigwig a life care spokesman told cnn that residents are free to speak with reporters and that it would never punish someone for doing so the company will speak to residents concerned about their care to try to resolve any issues he added mayberry said she told them her anger was mainly directed at the department of public health in los angeles county where her facility is located for failing to ensure that all employees were tested for coronavirus until recently the first positive case had been confirmed well into the facilitys lockdown so mayberry was convinced that a staff member had unknowingly brought it to the facility and as they went room to room treating patients like her she worried they continued to spread it the spokesman for life care said it was first notified of a positive case at bel tooren on april 10 and acknowledged that testing has been constrained and has taken longer than wed have liked    noting that testing for the facility has been coordinated through the county health department they have made the decisions on when and who will be tested in our facility he said our preference would have been to test both residents and staff sooner the los angeles county department of public health said it has been working to support testing of both residents and staff at county nursing homes and that not all have completed this testing a spokesman said the county will audit facilities to make sure they are complying with new state testing requirements and said earlier this week that bel tooren is still under investigation *** at first the only personal possessions that were brought to the makeshift isolation unit for her were her ipad and iphone her new room still had the belongings of someone else she said including fake flowers and a dresser full of items that she was afraid to touch she said her temperature became slightly elevated and she noticed that her oxygen levels were lower than usual when she checked them herself using a pulse oximeter but otherwise she said she was mainly asymptomatic soon after receiving her diagnosis she began railing against people she believed were being irresponsible and spreading the virus using the hashtag #covidiots according to mayberry she wasnt given a shower in more than a month and that was the last day she was helped out of bed until recently she was given a bed bath in mid may but claims that was only because she requested it for her birthday its been a little bit uncomfortable but i understand theyre just really really shorthanded she said adding that many of the nurses have become like family to her you feel sort of guilty that theyre giving up so much to work here  this isnt a job i would wish on anyone and they do it with kindness after cnn contacted the facility spokesman for comment mayberry said she was retested and given a shower and moved from isolation    suggesting that her test result came back negative for coronavirus this time her biggest fear is that employees    some of whom she said are older than she is    will stop coming to work entirely as she has read about happening at other nursing homes i am afraid that i am going to be ignored to death here she said the life care spokesman said he could not comment on specific patients due to privacy laws but that normal routines for patient care have been adjusted particularly for those patients who have tested positive he said the facility is starting to see residents recover from the virus and that when someone is listed as recovered they are moved into a new wing of the nursing home    apart from those residents who are positive or negative related nursing home workers warned government about safety violations before covid 19 outbreaks and deaths he said that for the safety of staff and since many rooms do not have private showers some residents are given sponge baths two to three times per week we recognize this has been a difficult time for residents their families and our staff he said our staff have endured much and are truly heroic for their efforts to stay and care for their patients even while they are at risk for contracting the virus other than the bits of information she is able to glean from her caregivers she said residents are not given any detailed updates on covid 19 cases so she regularly checks the data posted by the state to try to find out what is happening in her own building before she was moved to isolation and then to a different room she was able to listen for sirens knowing that an ambulance would likely be called if someone had died but lately she said she has been too far away to hear anything as of may 29 bel tooren villa convalescent hospital has reported 61 resident cases and 16 staff cases according to the facility twelve of mayberrys fellow residents have died do you have anything to share about covid 19 in nursing homes is there something else you think we should investigate email us watchdog@cnncom

        "text": "this article was published in partnership with artsy the global platform for discovering and collecting art the original article can be seen here the front door of arthur lewis los angeles home opens to a room organized like an exhibition space the marks of domesticity    dining room table mantel fireplace throw pillows    are present but engulfed by art paintings and sculptures grab all the attention and maybe the intention of the space titus kaphars enough about you greets your first glance kaphars much lauded work is based on an 18th century painting but in his version the focus is placed on a young black boy whose portrait is placed in an ornate gold frame meanwhile the rest of the composition    featuring white men in powder wigs including elihu yale    is crumpled up and trails off across the wall kaphars work speculates on the life desires and hopes of the lone black figure who in the original work remains small in the background serving yale and colleagues while wearing a steel collar the work is ambitious demanding and a reckoning on black possibilities and it encapsulates the ethos of lewis dynamic art collection lewis who recently became the creative director of uta fine arts and uta artist space is a fixture of the los angeles art community but before los angeles and before 13 years of building his bold collection his earliest engagements with art happened in his hometown of new orleans lewis credits the citys black cultural productions museums and vibrancy as an aesthetic and ethical foundation for what would become the tenets of his collection brilliantly executed craftsmanship narrative driven practices and the work of black practitioners when we spoke in early march lewis recalled the various daily influences and experiences that fostered his love for art    from the work of elizabeth catlett and lyndon barrois to the musicians and commissioned posters of jazz fest from mardi gras celebrations and artisans to the sculptures and festivities of louis armstrong park being able to grow up in that land of music food and art and then being in this beautiful community of artists that were just part of our everyday scene was an extraordinary thing lewis said through a lot of the architecture and the history that comes from new orleans you learn to appreciate your history in a way that many dont i was reminded every day of what took place in that city culturally lewis art collection which he shares with his partner hau ngyuen continues this sense of cultural legacy primarily centered on black people and black women artists the works range from minimalist markings and experimental video to sculpture and figurative paintings ebony g patterson sits across from genevieve gaignard toyin ojih odutola shares the dining room with torkwase dyson and kerry james marshall resides with sadie barnette emerging artists mix with mid career masters the house itself is a showcase of our rising stars and established icons making the domestic realm    a space measured in comfort due to its ability to be fixed    feel incredibly fresh the work of jennie c jones is present throughout the home lewis first fell in love with jones work and then jones herself after meeting her at the william h johnson auction in 2007 he sees jones minimalist sculptures paintings and works on paper as aesthetic offerings driven by a deep engagement with black sonic abstraction and black cultural criticism that were not present in the art world in the early 2000s lewis noted that jones helped him recognize the pivotal role of the collector in sustaining and growing artists careers and of course market value but also in joining a community of artists the value in lewis and ngyuens collection is not just in the objects worth but in the relationships built and fostered as they became caretakers and kinfolk to the artists themselves these ethics of care between jones and lewis over the last 13 years led many of the aforementioned artists to become part of the collection and the collectors la community that relationship part with jones is magical to me lewis said it is also the reason why somebody like torkwase entered our lives because jennie was in our sphere she opened up a lot of doors for us for a new way of looking at artists and narratives that we love to collect lewis credits mentors and fellow collectors joy simmons and ac hudgins as the other key figures who have guided the collection both simmons and hudgins noted the impact that lewis could and needed to have within both the artists life and the art community while connecting deeply with the diversity of art practices harbored under the moniker black art lewis has carried these tenets of influence to larger spheres and broad audiences through his positions on the boards of the underground museum the studio museum of harlem and the hammer museum here lewis sense of intentional and holistic collecting has aided in the showing and economic support of emerging international local and    perhaps most significantly    many artists across the african diaspora after beginning his new role at uta in june 2019 lewis hit the ground running by building out a compelling exhibition schedule and programming and strategizing with los angeles broader arts community we sat down with the hammer lacma and moca to talk about the fact that we were going to be in this space and we want to be an active participant in the conversation lewis said we want to make sure that we show the diversity of the art world at uta artist space    which is neither a commercial gallery nor a museum    lewis vision can manifest fully i love that we are a project space and we get to showcase lots of different voices in a collapsed amount of time he said so going from someone like arcmanoro niles during frieze art fair in february and then moving to julia wachtel right after is a really big leap on the art world stage but its second nature for us because we live in all of those spaces and its a pretty proud moment for us at the close of our conversation lewis expressed great pride and excitement about the coming years for the los angeles art scene with the opening of destination crenshaw    a 13 mile open air museum featuring the work of black artists along the metros crenshaw boulevard expansion    and the second year of frieze los angeles lewis feels a fresh allure surrounding the local art community i am so excited about where we are right now i think the biggest reason is that ive got to watch all of la show up he said the new projects and fairs enhance a sense of community that exists here so that people are now encouraged to share whats going on he added recalling the messages he received from artists and collectors during frieze los angeles inviting him to stop by events just that familiarity lewis said is something that feels very different"

joyce a yellow circle rotates as two black ovals and a curved line tumble at the bottom thwarted by gravity watching the video perseverance in the face of absurdity which was projected at banksys pop up dystopian theme park dismaland in 2015 one can mentally reassemble the three shapes into their familiar formation two eyes and a swooping smile its a testament to the symbol that it can be deconstructed to such a degree and yet still be immediately recognizable there is no doubt that its a smiley face though it looks anything but happy the yellow smiley icon was born in 1963 in worcester massachusetts when the graphic designer harvey ball was approached by state mutual life assurance company to create a morale booster for employees as the story goes it only took ten minutes for ball to create an icon that would knit itself so firmly in the fabric of american culture that wed be compelled to file lawsuits and contemplate it for decades to come he was paid a whopping $45 for his work for such an enduring image the logic behind it is almost laughably simple ball is often quoted as saying to the associated press i made a circle with a smile for a mouth on yellow paper because it was sunshiny and bright the company produced thousands of buttons and signs setting the stage for hallmark reps bernard and murray spain to swoop in in the early 1970s and copyright the design with the slogan have a happy day just one year later the french journalist franklin loufrani launched the smiley company which grew into a global licensing giant at its core the smiley is like any other symbol    a visual that has been assigned a specific meaning why have these symbols at all marcel danesi an anthropology and semiotics professor at the university of toronto said that symbols are like little capsules that tell us what things are about    in our own terms not unlike language they form a kind of rhetorical system that undergirds a whole society we live by symbols the stability of this system is up for debate symbols often exhibit the pliable quality of play doh on its face the smiley is simple and feelgood easy to learn and reproduce in the right context it elicits that giddy childhood rush    the morale boost that inspired the image from the start but stretched this way or that the icon quickly becomes surreal as jon savage penned for the guardian in 2009 the smiley presented such a fixed facade of childlike contentment that it was ripe for subversion over the years the icon has been reimagined by bands like nirvana and the talking heads and it flourished in the rave culture of the 80s and 90s imprinted on ecstasy pills and flyers for acid house djs teen vogue recently reported that the playful symbol seems to be making a resurgence in fashion including on marc jacobs runways and in justin biebers line drew house the smiley has held a rare dual position as a countercultural icon and a paragon of american consumerism the smiley company which brought in $4199 million in 2017 claims that the smiley is more than an icon its a spirit and a philosophy though the company is global this particular phrase strikes a very american chord it presents an almost cult like obsession with happiness    and what we can buy to achieve it when the icon appears in art its meaning is often twisted or exaggerated nate lowman has created childlike renderings of smileys overlapped and colored outside the lines lowman according to a 2012 new york times profile by jacob bernstein is somewhat obsessed with the face seeing in it a kind of collective mask    what he calls an anxious hysteria to appear happy various takes on the smiley have also appeared in jacqueline humphriess emoticon inspired pieces including     2016 wesley martin bergs darkly comedic medicate banksys grin reaper 2005 and flying copper 2004 and katsus facial recognition just released from jail 2015 among others the dj and producer fatboy slim who showed his impressive catalog of smiley ephemera in the recent exhibition smile high club has said he sees it as a symbol of happiness goofiness stupidity and unconditional life its hard to talk about the smiley face without broaching the subject of emojis which we sprinkle into everything from instagram posts to work emails the smiley is no longer a standalone icon but a single character in a visual online language though the invention of emoticons is commonly credited to shigetaka kurita of the japanese telecom company ntt docomo the primary set of yellow smilies bear an undeniable relation to balls original design as more communication happens online the smiley takes on a more nuanced range of emotions it can be a stand in for genuine happiness or a balm for words that might otherwise sound harsh the rise of emoticons has prompted a slew of studies and essays about the evolution of language online given its uncurtailed proliferation will the smiley ever lose its value as a signifier if it can mean everything then surely it will mean nothing danesi however seemed unconcerned by this existential threat to the happy symbol the more meaning we apply to it he suggested the more staying power it will have    even if we dont always know what to make of it or even simpler the smiley will persist because its cute maybe danesi said with a laugh hell go find a smiley t shirt to wear himself so that i can bring sunshine into peoples lives ironic or not that may be reason enough to smile"

wall of cup foods with the blessing of the shops owner mahmoud abumayyaleh one of abumayyalehs employees made the initial call that led to officers arriving on the scene to confront floyd mclain was approached by goldman to join the project this was our first time all painting together she said of her co artists who had met the previous year at a training session for latinx muralists though the process for such pieces is usually much longer thley were looking for a permanent shift in the intersections visual landscape it was very fast organized over instagramlike whos ready lets go mclain said my studio was able to provide the paint and we were able to move quickly this was the first mural that 45 year old belize born cadex herrera had completed after he had started as a mural apprentice with a local non profit last year as an art educator and intervention specialist at an elementary school he felt compelled to create something meaningful after hearing about floyds death my emotions were so raw he said over email the hurt is so deep and the wound wont heal because it opens up every time a person of color is killed unjustly and it doesnt stop for him art can help heal art is therapy art can say things you cannot express with words it brings the community together to reflect to grieve for strength and for support he mclain and goldman were helped by artists maria javier rachel breen niko alexander and pablo helmp hernandez however the final detail on the mural the words i can breathe now were added by someone else and reference the words repeated by floyd in the video of the killing i cant breathe the phrase came from an african american community member anjel carpenter who approached us and asked for it mclain said she then surveyed the community asking them if they preferred i can breathe now let me breathe and one more and they voted for i can breathe now we asked another member of the community to paint those words in carpenter expressed to us that the idea of not being able to breathe was fueling so much tension and anger mclain continued and that now george was with god and it was important for our community healing to claim our breath and ability to breathe justice for george thirty three year old shirien damra says she is relatively new to instagram but her memorial image dedicated to george floyd justice for george has already received over three million likes since she posted it the day after floyd was killed her work has been widely shared including by congresswomen alexandria ocasio cortez and rashida tlaib a native of chicago damra is the daughter of palestinian refugees and wants her work which brings together bold and soft colors to resonate as loving and calming yet hopeful i know the power of color and the emotion it can implicitly evoke she said over email i hope that my colors and imagery help the viewers process difficult emotions and events and come out of it with some hope and inspiration damra works as a freelance designer for social justice organizations and has created similar memorial illustrations including ones for ahmaud arbery who was killed by two men in may while jogging near his home in georgia and breonna taylor i wanted these pieces to be a gesture of solidarity with black communities in their time of grieving she said i noticed a lot of people sharing the videos of ahmaud and georges deaths so i wanted to create an alternative these videos are very traumatic and triggering she also hopes her illustrations will help combat stereotypes so often ive seen victims of anti black violence demonized as some kind of justification for their deaths implying that they did something to deserve it she said citing the fatal shooting of high school student trayvon martin by george zimmerman in 2012 as one example zimmerman a neighborhood watch volunteer dialed 911 to report a real suspicious guy who was up to no good  and hes just walking around before following and shooting martin he later claimed he was acting in self defense and was acquitted of murder by a florida jury he was a 17 year old kid who was seen as suspicious for wearing a hoodie damra said its a disturbing pattern that happens each time we hear news of another victim of anti black violence my way of challenging this was to carefully choose bright colors and florals to honor their memory and celebrate their lives in a beautiful way necessary acts on saturday new york based l\u00e1ol\u00fa senbanjo an artist and former human rights lawyer posted a photo on instagram of his watercolor and charcoal painting that depicts floyd with a target on his chest the image also features a likeness of donald trump vocalizing the incendiary tweet he wrote in response to protests and violence in the streets when the looting starts the shooting starts when i see video of men like george floyd treated as far less than human i can barely comprehend it 39 year old senbanjo said over email his proud face smashed into the pavement it breaks my heart apart ive been black all my life but for the first twenty years i was black in africa nigeria now ive been black in america and it is a different experience america doesnt honor what they have in their black citizens i couldnt not make art about the killing of george floyd senbanjo said that art can help with processing trauma every time there is a new senseless death or blatant manifestation of harmful white supremacy art can help us to instigate remember imagine discuss and express these complex experiences and feeling states do the right thing theoplis smith iii was born and raised in st louis missouri and his recent artwork of floyd presents him wearing the love and hate four knuckle rings worn by radio raheem played by bill nunn in spike lees 1989 movie do the right thing in the movie the unarmed raheem is choked to death by a police officer seeing this movie as a child i never imagined that what happened to radio raheem the character in the movie i would not only see on an eight minute video happening to a man before my eyes but have to sit and discuss with my 16 year old black son the 38 year old former banker said over email referring to chauvins use of a knee to neck restraint maneuver on floyd which allegedly led to his death smiths post of his artwork was shared by spike lees own instagram account smith who has created other memorial images such as one for michael brown a black teenager who was shot and killed by white police officer darren wilson six years ago in missouri said that making this type of art can be difficult unfortunately having to create out of many negative circumstances isnt my favorite thing to create but it is often my most impactful art for now and the future when art is used to bring attention to social issues it can connect with people in ways that other forms of political engagement cannot damra in chicago said art can touch the emotional core of what moves us toward social justice in ways that a strategy meeting or news or political analysis cant murals graffiti and paintings are a chance for communities to come together and speak their mind or represent themselves in public space the message for damra is clear we dont want any more black lives targeted by police and white supremacy as protests erupt all over the us memorials and demonstrations to floyd are also appearing around the world including one by street artist eme freethinker aka jesus cruz artiles who painted a mural of floyds likeness in berlin mclain wrote that it was crucial for white people to be loud and active about the decades of police violence and injustice directed at people of color adding the incredible racism and violence that our communities of color have been experiencing is not ok and we all need to stand and demand change we cannot be quiet similarly herrera in minnesota wants the mural to remind people of the message that black lives matter he wrote that we must all stand up for people of color who are singled out harassed brutalized mistreated and murdered by law enforcement every day smith in los angeles said the importance of social justice art is to galvanize people and to help them look to a better future art during these volatile times in history can either aggressively wake people up to reflect what is broken or paint a hopeful picture of what could be showing us a way forward"
