He suffered a cardiac arrest while being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on 25 May, the report found. It listed Mr Floyd's cause of death as \"cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint, and neck compression\". The examination also recorded evidence of heart disease and recent drug use. A video showing a white police officer continuing to kneel on Mr Floyd's neck even after he pleaded he could not breathe sparked outrage when it emerged a week ago. It has led to six consecutive days of protests around the United States and a level of civil unrest not seen this widely across the country in decades. The findings of the official post-mortem were released shortly after those of a private examination that was carried out by medical examiners hired by the Floyd family. That report said Mr Floyd, 46, died from asphyxia (lack of oxygen) due to a compression on his neck and back. It also found the death was a homicide, a statement from the family's legal team said. \"The cause of death in my opinion is asphyxia, due to compression to the neck - which can interfere with oxygen going to the brain - and compression to the back, which interferes with breathing,\" Dr Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner and one of the pair, said at a news conference on Monday. Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Floyd family, told Monday's news conference: \"Beyond doubt he would be alive today if not for the pressure applied to his neck by officer Derek Chauvin and the strain on his body by two other officers.\" He added: \"The ambulance was his hearse.\" More than 75 cities have seen protests over what happened to George Floyd. Streets that only days ago were deserted because of the coronavirus pandemic have filled with demonstrators marching shoulder to shoulder. The case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. It follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Eric Garner in New York and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement. On Sunday, mostly peaceful demonstrations once again gave way to violence in many cities, with clashes erupting between police and protesters. Police cars were burned, buildings were torched and shops looted in several places. Dozens of cities imposed curfews but they were defied. Many videos shared on social media from across the US appeared to show riot police responding disproportionately to demonstrators. Dozens of attacks targeting journalists have been reported. On Monday, President Trump told state governors they had been \"weak\" and had to get \"much tougher\", and utilise troops from the National Guard, thousands of whom have already been activated in two dozen states. \"You've got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you'll never see this stuff again,\" Mr Trump said in a video conference call, according to US media. There have been scenes of violence in Washington DC in recent nights, including near the White House. President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\". 15 sayings from around the world"

Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been \"very mixed\" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. It comes as lockdown measures are eased in England, including groups of six people being allowed to meet outside. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from Monday more than two million more pupils have been invited back. Latest government figures show 39,045 people with the virus have died in the UK, across all settings. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a day-on-day increase of 111 deaths and 1,570 new positive tests. An additional 445 deaths have been added to the overall death toll in the past day. The increase is explained by the retrospective inclusion of some patients whose tests were carried out by commercial partners, rather than the NHS or Public Health England. The head teachers' leader says the \"first impression\" has been of a very varied local picture - with not all schools either open or bringing back pupils as outlined in the government's plans. Some local authorities have not yet started to bring back more pupils, some schools have limited space, some are still training and not all staff are available, he said. \"Caution is the watchword, and everybody is approaching this task with the safety of pupils and staff as their absolute priority,\" said Mr Barton. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested almost 50% of children would be kept at home by parents. Mr Barton's early feedback suggests ranges of between 30% and 60% of pupils not attending school. But he said more key workers' children seemed to be coming in and he expected the overall numbers to increase as \"more parents become confident\". The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has warned it was not yet safe to open schools - and the union's co-leader, Kevin Courtney, said delaying the wider opening of schools would \"make our communities safer\". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they \"will be with their teachers and friends again\". \"I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,\" says 11-year-old Sean, returning to school in Mortlake, West London. BBC News education reporter Judith Burns describes the return to school: \"You look like you've grown,\" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. \"Are you excited to be back?\" Helen Frostick head of St Mary Magdalen's Catholic primary school in Mortlake, West London asks another. About half of those who could have returned have taken up their places, alongside 15 children of key workers who have continued to come into school throughout the lockdown. The classrooms have been completely reorganised, with desks in rows, facing forwards, instead of pushed together into big tables. There's lots of hand washing and the windows are open to let in fresh air. The school has split each class into two separate bubbles with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. In the Reception class each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much, says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. \"It really is best for the family,\" says mum Sophia as she brings her two sons to school. She has managed to do some home schooling with the boys over the past few weeks but it hasn't always been easy. \"I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,\" says Julia, who has just dropped off her son. \"The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back,\" she says. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested approaching half of families would keep their children at home. It expected that: Jane Reid, a parent from York, said it was still not safe for her son to go back to school, saying: \"It's a definite no from me. \"Plus, the contradictory information is infuriating. I can take him to school, but can't get his hair cut.\" \"How can I send them to school now, knowing it will be impossible for teachers to implement social distancing rules properly?\" asked Valerie Brooker from Haslemere in Surrey. In other developments in England: In Wales, people from two different households can meet each other outdoors. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors. For some parents the decision has been taken out of their hands. Lancashire County Council is among those saying it is not yet safe to open schools. A mother in Lancashire, who wanted to remain anonymous, has described this as a relief as she did not want her child to go back, although her husband did. The way that schools are bringing back pupils has many local variations - spread out over the next couple of weeks and with many schools making their own arrangements over which year groups return and for how many days a week. The day looked very different for those pupils who did return - with staggered drop-off times and children staying in small groups of no more than 15 pupils. Ministers say opening schools will help with childcare for parents returning to work - and to help children catch up with missed lessons. From 15 June secondary pupils will start to return, in Years 10 and 12 - and there are plans for all primary years to go back for the last month of term. Nurseries and early years' providers are also opening, and a survey of 4,500 parents with young children, carried out by the Early Years Alliance, indicated a divided picture on take-up. The biggest reason for parents not sending in their children was concern about safety. Chief executive Neil Leitch warned the row over the prime minister's adviser Dominic Cummings travelling during lockdown threatened to undermine parents' trust on safety measures. The concern was echoed by the Royal Society of Arts which published a survey of more than 2,000 adults in the UK showing 49% think the government is too caught up in the \"Dominic Cummings affair\" to be making the right decisions about schools. \"Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low,\" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said the lower demand for childcare places would put nurseries under \"extraordinary financial pressure\" and  \"millions of childcare places could be lost in this crisis\".

They had been warned that only a limited number of shoppers would be welcomed with only one adult and one child from a household allowed in. But Ikea was forced to shut car parks at some stores to help ease pressure. In Warrington, people arrived at 05:40 to start queuing for the Ikea store to reopen at 09;00. The company praised shoppers for their patience. \"Where we've seen strong demand we've taken appropriate decisions to open early for browsing and to temporarily close our car parks to help ease pressure and reduce waiting times,\" Ikea said. \"We're incredibly grateful to the public in playing their part to help keep everyone safe.\" In Warrington, a line of more than 1,000 people snaked around the car park with similar scenes at Ikea's Wembley store. On Twitter, shoppers complained of \"five-mile queues\" in Croydon, Wembley and outside of London. Law student Alexi Norris visited Wembley to buy a desk but was shocked at the long waits. West Midlands police took to Twitter to warn people of large queues at Ikea's Wednesbury branch. The police urged: \"Please consider if you need to go there today as you may be in for a very long wait.\" There were long queues outside the Belfast branch, noted BBC reporter Mark Simpson. In Manchester one shopper (who didn't want to be named) told the BBC that despite queues outside, inside the shop it was easy to maintain social-distancing. \"It's very busy with every entrance manned by staff with walkie talkies who were managing the long queues that had formed,\" the shopper said. \"We arrived just after 11:00 and had to queue for about an hour and a half before we were allowed into the store. \"However, once inside though the store was much emptier than usual, so it was very easy to stay a safe distance from the other shoppers.\" But some criticized the long queues as a sign of runaway consumerism. One Twitter user said: \"Don't understand how a person sees this Ikea queue and actually joins it, rather than\u2026 heading home for a beer.\" Others warned that people queuing were risking catching coronavirus. One said: \"People shopping at Ikea moaning about the people in the queue at Ikea today. It's the 'it's not me, it's everyone else' attitude that will cause the inevitable second wave. \"Wear a mask and only go out if you have to. It's not that hard, surely?\" An Ikea spokesperson said: \"The health and safety of our customers and co-workers remains our top priority, which is why we put extensive and enhanced measures in place to create a safe and comfortable experience.\" The measures include limiting numbers of customers in stores, a staggered entry system, screens in key areas and social-distancing wardens. All play areas and the restaurants have remained closed. \"We ask that these measures are respected at all times,\" Ikea said. It had asked customers to \"come prepared with ready-made lists and their own bags to help ease waiting times\". It also pleaded with customers wishing to return items, \"to do so at a later date\". \"While frustrating, these planned measures are in place to ensure everyone's safety,\" Ikea said. \"To avoid queues, we'd ask those purely wishing to browse, to visit us in the coming weeks.\" Meanwhile, new footfall data from retail analyst Springboard has shown a sharp rise in the number of shoppers as a result of lockdown restrictions in England being eased. Overall, shopper numbers were up 36% on last week's Bank Holiday Monday and 21% on the week before that. High Streets saw the largest increase, with footfall up 44% on last week and 24% on the week before. The increases have come despite only limited reopening allowed in England. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have not yet allowed similar shops to open again. President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

The UK enjoyed 266 hours of sunshine in May - surpassing the previous record of 265 hours in June 1957. And it is even more extraordinary following a drenching winter, with record rain in February. Meteorologists say they are amazed at the sudden switch from extreme wet to extreme dry \u2013 it is not \"British\" weather. On average the UK gets 436 hours of sunshine between March and the end of May. Since 1929, only 10 years have had more than 500 hours. And none has got more than 555 hours. Scientists say the recent weather in the UK has been unprecedented and astounding. This year we've bathed in an extraordinary 626 hours - smashing the previous record by a \u201cstaggering\u201d amount, one Met Office worker said. It is because the jet stream has locked the fine weather in place, just as it locked the previous winter rainfall in place. Professor Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society, told BBC News: \u201cWe\u2019ve swung from a really unsettled spell with weather systems coming in off the Atlantic to a very, very settled spell. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented to see such a swing from one extreme to the other in such a short space of time. That\u2019s what concerns me. We don\u2019t see these things normally happening with our seasons. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern where we\u2019re experiencing increasingly extreme weather as the climate changes.\u201d Mark McCarthy, from the Met Office, said: \u201cIf we look at the difference in rainfall that\u2019s fallen over the winter compared to spring it is the largest difference in rainfall amount in our national series from 1862. \u201cThe sunshine statistics are really astounding. \u201cThe stand out is by how much sunshine has broken the previous record - set in 1948. There\u2019s been more sunshine than most of our past summer seasons. It's quite remarkable.\" One of his colleagues described the figures as \"absolutely staggering\". The Met Office says this year is not an indicator of the future, because the jet stream might behave differently. Scientists suspect man-made climate change may be implicated, but it is too soon to tell. Some of them believe the rapid man-made heating of the Arctic, which has led to record temperatures and wildfires in Siberia, may be influencing the jet stream, although that is not proven. Professor Joe Smith, chief executive of the Royal Geographical Society, told BBC News: \"For many people, the recent long sunny spell is simply 'nice weather'. \"In a wider context it\u2019s a signal of the increasing unpredictability of the UK\u2019s climate. Planning for the growing season is starting to resemble a night at the gambling tables. \u201cThe fact remains that bold early actions to slash emissions can still cut the larger risks associated with climate change in the UK and around the world\u201d.

The first minister relaxed restrictions north of the border on Friday, allowing more people to meet up while outdoors. She said the \"vast majority\" had complied with recommendations not to travel and to keep gatherings small. But Ms Sturgeon said it was clear that not everyone had complied, with police dispersing more than 2,000 gatherings. Police Scotland said there had been 1,391 \"compliant dispersals\" of groups of people over Friday, Saturday and Sunday, with another 650 where groups broke up \"after a police warning\". And with car traffic trebling at some beauty spots, the first minister said she would not hesitate to put restrictions on group size and travel distance into law. Scotland took its first step on the government's \"routemap\" out of lockdown over the weekend, with people from two different households allowed to meet up outdoors in groups of no more than eight. People are also allowed to travel within their local area for recreation and exercise, although the government \"strongly recommends\" they do not travel more than five miles. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to thank \"the vast majority\" of people for sticking to the rules. But she said it was clear that not everybody was heeding the advice, with police having to move on hundreds of people for not complying with regulations. She said the 797 dispersals carried out by police on Saturday was five times the number seen a week previously, and that traffic volumes had risen sharply. Traffic around beauty spots like Loch Lomond and Glen Coe was \"about three times higher\" than it was the previous weekend, with Ms Sturgeon saying it was \"hard to see how that was caused by local residents\". She said ministers had \"deliberately allowed some flexibility\" and \"left some room for discretion\" when setting out the new guidelines, because they trusted the majority to follow the rules. But she said: \"It's worth being clear that if there is continued evidence of even a minority not abiding by these guidelines and travelling unnecessarily, or meeting up in larger groups, we will have to put these restrictions on group size and travel distance into law. \"We will not hesitate to do that if it is necessary for the collective wellbeing of society.\" Police said more than 2,000 gatherings had been broke up in total over the weekend. A total of 16 fixed penalty notice fines were issued, but there were no arrests related to breaches of coronavirus legislation. Deputy Chief Constable Will Kerr said the \"increase in people out and about following the relaxing of some of the restrictions has seen a rise in crime levels\", with increasing demands on police. He added: \"We all want to enjoy our outdoor spaces safely and, whilst our officers will continue to robustly tackle crime and anti-social behaviour, please take reasonable steps to keep yourself safe and act responsibly.\" The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 in Scotland continues to fall, with just 27 now in intensive care wards. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that the progress which had been made was \"fragile\". \"The virus is being suppressed, but it has not gone away and it is still extremely dangerous,\" she said. \"The progress we have made so far is simply not guaranteed and is not irreversible. Cases could increase again, it would not take much for that to happen, and that would result in more loss of life. \"If all of that happens, then restrictions will have to be re-imposed rather than being further relaxed.\" The first minister added: \"To the minority that flout all of this, it's not just the virus running out of control you're risking - it's taking flexibility away from people who are abiding by the rules.\" Ms Sturgeon said the issue had been brought home to her after one of her own friends had been diagnosed with Covid-19. She said: \"Until this weekend, I didn't know anybody personally, within my own family or friends network, who had had this virus in a significant way. That changed this weekend. \"Why am I telling you that? Because it's still there. Even with these numbers going down, there are still people testing positive for this virus. \"It's still there - it's ready to pounce, and jump across any bridges we offer it. If we want to stop that, we must, must stick to these guidelines. \"I'm saying this as a citizen as much as as a first minister - please do that, and together we will continue to make this progress.\" President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

Mar\u00eda Reyes Maroto said British coronavirus figures \"still have to improve\" before Spain could receive tourists from the UK. Last week, the Spanish government said foreign visitors would no longer have to undergo a two-week quarantine from 1 July. But Ms Reyes Maroto said tourist activity would be resumed \"gradually\". \"For Spain, it is very important that the first tourists are tourists who are in the same epidemiological situation as us, and that they are able to fly safely,\" she said in a statement. \"Regarding the United Kingdom, there have been talks with tour operators but British data still have to improve, because it's important to ensure that the person comes well and then returns well.\" The tourism minister said that as soon as conditions improved in the UK, Spain would be ready to receive British citizens \"with the same hospitality as ever\". Spain normally attracts 80 million tourists a year, with the sector providing more than 12% of the country's GDP. Opening up the holiday market again before the summer season is over is seen as crucial to the Spanish economy. However, just as Spain prepares to end its quarantine policy, the UK is set to impose a 14-day quarantine of its own for arrivals from 8 June, including returning holidaymakers. That would mean that any tourists coming home after taking holidays in most foreign destinations would have to spend two weeks in self-isolation. Other tourist destinations are also beginning to open up, with Greece announcing that flights to Athens and Thessaloniki airports will resume on 15 June - but only from those parts of Europe that have escaped the worst of the pandemic. Other Greek airports are due to reopen on 1 July. At the same time, tourism authorities in the Algarve region of Portugal have said its beaches will be open for tourists on 6 June, with flights resuming to the region's international airport, Faro, from the UK and Ireland. However, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office continues to advise against all non-essential foreign travel.

The app currently lets people filter potential matches according to their age, height, weight and ethnicity. But critics say the ethnicity filter fuels discrimination and that the app does too little to tackle racism. Announcing the change, Grindr said it had a \"zero-tolerance policy for racism and hate speech\" on its platform. by Ben Hunte, LGBT correspondent For years, LGBT people of colour have flagged the ethnicity filter as an issue - but they received no response from Grindr. Many even got blocked by the company. Today, change happened. But some are angry that it has only happened as a result of white people speaking up on social media. Indeed, the most-shared social media posts written to shame Grindr into action were posted by white gay men. There are also LGBT people of colour who are disappointed that this change is happening at all. Some have told me that they used the ethnicity filter to find people like themselves, perhaps not to date but for shared experiences and cultural understanding. In some cases it was needed. In February, at a queer club night for Black and Asian people, one party-goer showed me how black men did not appear on his Grindr until the white men had been filtered out. Grindr is not the only LGBT dating app to allow filtering by race. The spotlight will now move to others that have yet to take a similar stance. On 29 May, Grindr had tweeted \"Demand justice. #BlackLivesMatter\", with a link to further information. This had prompted several users to accuse the company of hypocrisy. One message saying \"remove the ethnicity filter\" was retweeted 1,000 times. Grindr later deleted its own tweet and on 1 June posted a new message explaining its change of position. We will not be silent.

The events were sparked by the killing of George Floyd - a black man who died after a white officer continued kneeling on is neck even after he had pleaded that he could not breathe. While some Grindr users welcomed the removal of the filter, others said the company had taken too long to implement the change, and had done the \"bare minimum\". Do NOT applaud @Grindr for this.

The shows were held at secret locations, each lasting five minutes from 20:00 local time (12:00 BST). Organisers set a time limit for the displays to avoid crowds gathering. Initially, they said the time and date of the event would not be revealed but later reversed course, deciding a sudden pyrotechnics show could cause distress to some. Filling the skies with a burst of light, the fireworks lasted long enough for people who did not know about it in advance to view them from the street or their homes. Yet, the fireworks still drew modest crowds in places. In the capital Tokyo, people were seen watching the displays near the Tama River, before dispersing when they were over. \"I had a hunch, so I came here,\" one of the spectators, Yukiji Kushiro, told Japanese newspaper the Mainichi Shimbun. \"Even though they say it's a secret, there are only so many places they can launch fireworks.\" Dozens of firework-makers nationwide were involved in organising the synchronised displays, a project called \"Cheer up Hanabi\". They are struggling to keep their businesses afloat because many traditional festivals have been cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. The postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics was a major blow for the industry, leaving craftsmen unable to sell fireworks they had spent months making. One of the craftsmen, 38-year-old Kouhei Ogatsu, said the pyrotechnics industry had been discussing ways to cheer up a society \"changed so much by the coronavirus\". \"Historically fireworks in Japan have been launched to pray for the eradication of plagues and to console the spirits of the deceased,\" he told the AFP news agency. Written messages praying for the end of the pandemic were attached to some of Mr Ogsatu's fireworks. His company launched nearly 100 fireworks from four locations across eastern Japan.\"Of course I don't think the coronavirus will disappear with our fireworks. But we wanted to do this and hope something good will come out of it,\" he said. Last month, Japan lifted its state of emergency after a marked fall in new coronavirus cases. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged people to \"remain vigilant\" and adopt a \"new lifestyle\" to prevent a second wave of infections. Japan faced early criticism for its handling of the virus, but appears now to have avoided a epidemic on the scale of that seen in the US, Russia or the UK. The country has recorded 16,787 infections and 899 deaths so far, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

He said a rare blood disorder and faulty heart valve had \"constantly held me back\". Mr Waddup added his daughter, 10, hoped the win meant she could go on holiday abroad for the first time. \"For as long as I can remember I have wanted to buy old properties, do them up and build my own portfolio,\" he said. \"Friends and family laughed at my dream, especially when I was a teenager.\" He studied Design Technology, worked on building sites and trained to become an electrician with this ambition in mind. However, he said ill health had meant he had \"been in and out of hospital a lot over the last few years\"  and had been unable to work since last summer. Mr Waddup said he had played the Euromillions game for the first time this month and had been in \"a bit of a daze\" since the win. \"Due to coronavirus, I can't celebrate with my family and I can't wait to see people and talk about the win - I will definitely be treating my family,\" he said. \"I will also get a passport for my daughter and, when we can, take a trip abroad - she has already told me that she wants to go to Spain.\" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Cate Searle took this photo of her children with their grandmother in Hampshire. \"My mum is over 70 and has been shielding. It was the first time she saw the boys since February,\" says Cate. In Derbyshire, 80-year-old Sheila also saw her grandchildren again for the first time in 10 weeks. In Aberdeenshire, the Wilkie and Stephen families wore face masks when they got together. Margaret Stephen says:  \"Eighty-six-year-old Nanny hadn't seen all her grandchildren for 11 weeks\". While there were grandparents who had not seen their grandchildren for some time, there were others who had never seen their new grandchildren. Jamie Riley in Buckinghamshire introduced six-week-old baby Eden to her grandparents. In Edinburgh, grandparents Fergus and Judy Gilmour met their four-week-old grandson, Brodie, for the first time. In Leicester, baby Luna who was born on 15 April, finally met her grandparents. As lockdown restrictions are relaxed, the government continues to reinforce the importance of social distancing. The government's advice remains that a person should \"stay two metres apart from anyone outside of [one's] household\". . The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"

But it's a very different type of vehicle to Nasa's retired spaceplane. Elon Musk says human spaceflight had always been the fundamental goal for his pioneering company SpaceX. The entrepreneur achieved that ambition on Saturday 30 May 2020, when the Crew Dragon spacecraft carried Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken into orbit for a rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS). But the company had to walk before it could run. Crew Dragon evolved from an earlier design, called Dragon 1, which launched 20 times on missions to deliver cargo to the ISS between May 2012 and March 2020. In May 2014, Musk unveiled the seven-seat Crew Dragon concept during an event at SpaceX's headquarters in Hawthorne, California. Like Dragon 1, the crewed version is a capsule design, making it more similar to the Apollo command modules that carried astronauts to the Moon than the winged space shuttle concept, which was conceived to carry both a crew and a large payload. From launch up until shortly before re-entry, the capsule is attached to a section called the trunk which has solar panels, heat-removal radiators and fins to provide stability during emergency aborts. Together, the capsule and trunk stand around 8.1m (26.7ft) tall, with a diameter of 4m (13ft). The Crew Dragon is equipped with 16 Draco thrusters that are used to manoeuvre the vehicle in orbit. Each Draco is capable of producing 90 pounds of force in the vacuum of space. SpaceX engineer John Federspiel, explains: \"When we wanted to take Dragon and make it human-rated, I think we took a different approach to spaceship design than has previously been done, because we wanted this to feel like a 21st Century spaceship. \"Probably one of the biggest features of Dragon are the touchscreens on the inside. We designed them not just to be very functional, but with a user experience in mind.\" The three large displays that allow Hurley and Behnken to monitor systems and control the spacecraft are a world away from the analogue buttons, dials and control stick that featured in the cockpit of the shuttle, which flew from 1981 to 2011. The two Nasa astronauts have been working with SpaceX to get the vehicle ready for its first crewed flight. Hurley admits that the \"glass cockpit\" took a bit of getting used to. \"As far as actual physical feedback, you certainly don't get that from the touchscreen,\" he says. \"But what you do get is an indication of where you touched and that's part of the process of flying the vehicle manually is... I touched that button and that made the vehicle go up and I got the return flash that that's what the vehicle recognised as my input.\" For the types of scenarios where astronauts might need to assume manual control of the normally autonomous craft, such as finishing off a docking sequence with the space station, the touchscreen controls are \"much more than adequate\", Hurley adds. \"It just might not be the same thing you'd want to use if you were suited up and trying to fly an entry or descent, for example, like we could do with the space shuttle,\" says Behnken. But tailoring the spacecraft to the user experience involved more than just the design of the controls. \"When I think of comfort for the astronauts, it's really every aspect of how you could interact with the spaceship that comes to mind,\" says John Federspiel. \"We have three different seat sizes, we even go so far as moulding the foam around the astronaut's body so there's not any pressure points and it's just generally a pleasurable journey into space.\" But in case anything goes wrong on the pad or during the climb to orbit, SpaceX has designed an innovative abort system for the capsule. The launch escape system (LES) consists of a set of SpaceX-designed SuperDraco engines that fire in the event of an emergency to propel the capsule and its crew safely away from the rocket. Commenting on the LES, Doug Hurley says: \"That perspective for me is huge compared to shuttle, where there were what we call 'black zones'... scenarios where it didn't really matter if you had the right combination of failures, you were likely not going to survive.\" In addition, Hurley comments: \"The capsule design is a safer design than a winged vehicle under most circumstances.\" Behnken adds: \"The space shuttle was 10 times larger in terms of mass than you needed to get into low-Earth orbit... flying on a smaller rocket, really focused on the crew mission... provides another level of safety.\" John Federspiel explains: \"Dragon is a spaceship that's all about safety and reliability. We designed it to be two-fault tolerant, which means that any two things could fail, so I could lose a flight computer and a thruster and I could still bring the crew home safely.\" When it returns to Earth, the Crew Dragon can't simply land on a runway like the space shuttle. \"I think there's an argument that the return is more dangerous in some ways than the ascent,\" says Elon Musk. During re-entry, the heat shield must survive temperatures hotter than the surface of the Sun, as the Crew Dragon screams through the atmosphere at up to 25 times the speed of sound. There's a minor chance that the spacecraft's asymmetric design - driven by the placement of its emergency escape system - could cause it to roll too much. Musk has said in the past that the issue, known as roll instability, has been extensively studied, but that it still worries him. Then, after the fiery re-entry phase, the spacecraft needs to deploy four parachutes to slow its descent. Finally, the Crew Dragon splashes down in the Atlantic Ocean, 450km off the coast of Florida, where recovery ships will take the astronauts to safety and retrieve the capsule. Hurley says that while he and Behnken - along with others at Nasa - provided input, \"this spacecraft - Crew Dragon - is SpaceX's design, from start to finish. Make no mistake about that\". He adds: \"Just to see the vehicle come from not very much, a preliminary design, to where it is today, the operability of the vehicle, the clean lines, how it is inside the vehicle, how it is for a crew... we're just excited to put it through its paces.\" Follow Paul on Twitter.

Ms Kuriyan says her art was inspired by her neighbours, as well as people she saw at the airport when she took a flight from the southern city of Bangalore to visit her friend in the eastern city of Kolkata (formerly Calcutta). This was before masks were made mandatory and flights grounded. However, the threat of Covid-19 had just begun to emerge so some people had already begun wearing face coverings as protection. \"At that point, we had no idea of the disarray the next few months would bring,\" she says. Her cartoons are humorous snapshots of people, trying to live their normal lives amid the backdrop of the looming pandemic - like the honeymooning couple in the first picture, who Ms Kuriyan says seemed \"determined to get their honeymoon to a flying start\". The next image - of \"Batman\" landing at the Kolkata airport was during a time she says that bats were being discussed in great detail within the context of the coronavirus' origins. \"Information about bats were just flying around,\" she says. The next cartoon is inspired by a scene Ms Kuriyan witnessed at the Bangalore airport. At the baggage claim belt, a group of sales girls were returning from an offsite trip, in identical sarees and masks. \"Something had clearly gone viral,\" says Ms Kuriyan. But the masks were not only being restricted to airports. People had started wearing them every time they left their homes. \"Back in my home in Bangalore, the only people to be spotted were those from my neighbourhood who I saw during my fortnightly visits to the grocers - many of them wearing some form of homemade mask,\" she says. But there was some creativity to be had as well. In Kolkata, these young men seemed to be the only ones with some premonition of the chaos that was to come - and they accessorised accordingly. But mask or no mask, some habits die hard. Like for instance, this group of people who were still posing - and smiling - for the mandatory \"airport selfie\". The idea of social distancing is also one that is hard to stomach for many Indians, and Ms Kuriyan says she saw many examples of \"social distancing fail\". \"On other days of social isolation, spying out from my kitchen window, to the street across my apartment, I was witness to some social distancing fail. It was a metaphor of how ironic the idea of social distancing was in a country where not even the real estate on a scooter is spared,\" she says.

Bosses have said filming will resume on 9 June, and crew have already returned to the Manchester set to prepare. Social distancing and other safety measures will be in place. But no actors with underlying health conditions or aged over 70 will be allowed back yet - ruling out the likes of William Roache and Maureen Lipman. After filming was halted in March, ITV went down to airing three episodes per week. The new filming pattern will allow the same broadcast schedule to continue, ITV said. Cast and crew will have their temperatures checked on a daily basis, and actors will put on their own make-up and costumes. Actors over 70 or those with underlying conditions \"won't be on set in the initial period of filming\", a statement said. Other measures will include crew members being assigned only to certain parts of the set and having designated equipment. Actor Andrew Whyment, who plays Kirk Sutherland, told ITV's Good Morning Britain With Lorraine Kelly: \"I think everybody is ready to get back to work now. It's going to be different, but I think we're all ready to get back now, get back to shooting the show again.\" John Whiston, ITV managing director of continuing drama, said: \"With the peak past, all indications are that the time is right for a return to filming. And with the extensive protocols we have put in place, we have made our workplace as safe as possible. \"I'm sure our audience will appreciate having the show they love continue on air. For many who have written in it is a vital escape from all the fears and stresses this virus brings in its wake.\" In remarks reported by Broadcast magazine last week, Whiston said there were some challenges to making life on the cobbles look like it is picking up from where it left off. \"For some reason during lockdown, all the men have shaved their heads, while the women have dyed their hair,\" he said. \"That is proving quite a headache - particularly as we can't go near them to do anything with it.\" Emmerdale has already returned to filming, by recording new episodes showing characters dealing with lockdown. EastEnders is also expected to resume this month. It follows the publication in May of guidelines for the TV industry to get back to work. Meanwhile on Monday, further safety guidelines were published for the return of film and \"high-end\", bigger-budget TV drama. They include measures such as social distancing, and they also say: Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Early in the Covid-19 outbreak, the Shetland Islands were one of the worst-hit areas of the UK by head of population. Now, no new cases have been detected there for six weeks. Some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown - but for the first family on the islands to test positive, it hasn't been easy. It was a clear, bright Tuesday in early March when the plane began its descent. The Shetland archipelago stretched out ahead of the tiny twin-propeller aircraft. Iain Malcolmson looked through his passenger-seat window at the sprawl of islands, aware of how far north he'd just travelled. Iain, 53, an architect, was on his way home. He and his wife, Suzanne, had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples with four friends. They'd hesitated before setting off on 28 February - news bulletins were full of alarming footage of the Covid-19 cluster in Lombardy, 500 miles to the north of where they were staying. But official travel advice at that point was clear - it was safe to visit the south of the country - so they'd gone as planned. All the same, Iain recalled spending the trip fastidiously wiping down restaurant tables and washing his hands. Now, after an overnight stop in Edinburgh, Iain would soon be back at the house in the tiny settlement of Nesting, about 12 miles north of the islands' capital, Lerwick. Locals call this leg of the journey the \"white-knuckle express\"; in strong winds, the plane has to take off and land at Sumburgh Airport sideways, like a crab. Normally, Iain preferred the 14-hour overnight ferry from Aberdeen. But on this occasion everything seemed calm. During the first week of March 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic that had raged out of Wuhan still seemed far away. Here in the tiny aeroplane, Scotland's mainland was 110 miles to the south, Norway was 190 miles to the east. It was still possible to conceive that Shetland might be spared. \"You have to understand what Shetland is like,\" says Iain. \"We're pretty isolated, and I think most people thought it would be something that would happen to other people. It wouldn't have come to Shetland.\" Then, two days after he landed, on the evening of Thursday 5 March, Iain noticed he had a headache. From Sumburgh Head in the south to Out Stack, the northernmost point in the British Isles, Shetland has 567 sq miles of land and 1,679 miles of coastline. Of its 100-odd islands, 16 are inhabited, and about half the 23,000 population, like Iain and his family, live close to Lerwick. In the summer, days are up to 19 hours long; in the winter, if you're lucky, you can see the Northern Lights. The islands were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468, and the Norn language - a form of Old Norse spoken on the islands - died out in the mid-19th Century. The Scandinavian influence is still strong, from the Nordic-derived placenames - Burravoe, Grutness, Mavis Grind - to the brightly coloured timber-clad houses dotted across the landscape, and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals, which conclude with the torching of a Viking galley. But despite this Shetlanders don't want the rest of Scotland to forget about them. A 2018 law introduced by the islands' Member of the Scottish Parliament banned public bodies from producing maps that depict Shetland, for reasons of cartographical convenience, in a box in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney rather than its true geographical location. Iain was raised as a Shetlander. He left to study architecture in Edinburgh, where he met Suzanne, but two decades later, after starting a family, they decided to open a practice back on Shetland. It had been their dream for a long time. \"It's just the freedom that you have,\" he says. \"You've got family, friends and that sort of thing. It's a very friendly, positive sort of place.\" He's a well-known figure in Shetland - he sits on the local community council, is a keen Up Helly Aa participant and has played guitar in local bands. The property he and Suzanne designed for their family to the dimensions of a Norse longhouse was featured on the BBC's Scotland's Home of the Year programme. Shetland might be remote, but it is no backwater. Thanks in part to the discovery of North Sea oil in the late 20th Century, its per capita GDP is among the highest of all Scotland's local authority areas. In the 1970s, the local council drove an extraordinarily hard bargain with the energy companies who wanted to operate the terminal at Sullum Voe. Compensation payments were invested in a charitable trust that ensures the islands have exceptionally good public services. \"The facilities up here are second to none,\" says Iain. \"Every little community has its own leisure centre or pool.\" When he woke on the morning of Friday 6 March, Iain still didn't feel well. For the past two days he'd gone in to work, but now he clearly wasn't up to it. One of the friends he'd travelled to Naples with, a Glasgow resident, wasn't feeling great either and had been advised by the NHS to get tested; so Iain and Suzanne arranged to be tested too. Nurses arrived at the couple's house. They stripped off on the porch and, before stepping inside, changed into full PPE - visors, protective suits - before taking swabs from the Malcomsons' noses and the backs of their throats. \"It was like something off the telly,\" Iain says. The whole scenario was unnerving, but the staff were reassuring. \"They were saying: 'You'll be fine, the chances of you having it where you've been are almost zero. So don't worry about it.'\" He says he and Suzanne stayed indoors that weekend anyway. There was a delay while the samples were tested - Iain was told they had to be flown down to Aberdeen and then taken to Glasgow. On Sunday evening the results came through: Shetland had its first confirmed cases of Covid-19. \"Everybody was gobsmacked,\" says Iain. \"And it all kicked off from there.\" At least one person on Shetland wasn't surprised by the arrival of the virus. His name is Michael Dickson. Not long before, as NHS Shetland's chief executive, he'd been summoned to the mainland for a presentation on the likely impact of the pandemic. \"I can honestly say when I came out of the government briefing, it was without a doubt the worst day of my entire career,\" he says. \"To go back to Shetland and have to share that with the people of Shetland was incredibly difficult.\" He also knew that Shetland's geographical isolation would make treating the virus there especially challenging. \"Lovely as it is,\" he says, Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital \"was never built for this.\" There is no intensive care unit anywhere on the islands. At that stage, any patients who became critically unwell would need to be flown to Aberdeen or elsewhere on the mainland in an enormous RAF Atlas military transport aircraft. But Shetland would have advantages, too. Standing at his front door, \"I can cast my eye out and see no-one\", he says. \"There's houses but I'm not going to see anyone walking down the street. If I go for a five-mile run I might run into three or four people. It's just a completely different place to socially distance.\" Also, an outbreak of measles on the Aberdeen ferry meant NHS Shetland had very recent experience of carrying out contact tracing. \"That was hugely useful,\" he says. \"The fact is, knowing the geography of Shetland, the different communities, makes a huge difference.\" This was crucial, Dickson says, after the first positive test results came in. \"When that call went out from the Public Health teams to say we need to do this now, there wasn't a debate. People came in on their Sundays and said 'Right, let's start, let's get on with this.'\" The nurses in visors and PPE suits who came to test the Malcolmsons took the names of everyone they had come in contact with and tested them too. According to Dr Susan Laidlaw, NHS Shetland's public health consultant, staff from other NHS departments were drafted in to phone contacts. \"We had a week of very long hours and intense work following up the contacts, identifying new cases and getting them tested and isolated,\" she says. \"Although difficult at the time, this did help to contain the initial outbreak.\" \"Everybody at our work got it,\" Iain says. \"And everyone from our work's family ended up getting it.\" Some had diarrhoea, others lost all sense of smell and taste. Others fared worse - Iain says the father of one of his employees had to be airlifted to Aberdeen. He would later make a full recovery. While the contact tracers scrambled to identify how far the virus had spread, Iain's condition was getting worse. Suzanne's symptoms were cold-like, but his were more like the flu - a high temperature, shivering. There was talk of flying Iain, too, to Aberdeen. The prospect terrified him. \"I really didn't want to go off the island,\" he says. After a few days, Iain's symptoms began to improve. But the knowledge he might have given the virus to others in less robust health weighed heavily on him. He was terrified he'd given it to his parents, both in their 80s. \"That stress was there, knowing that you could have given it to people who weren't going to be as lucky as you.\" And while he'd been feeling unwell, Iain hadn't felt much like looking at social media. He hadn't yet seen the rumours about him. The virus spread quickly on Shetland. On 12 March, four days after Iain and Suzanne's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases announced in the local press rose from two to six; five days later, they stood at 15; by 19 March, they had risen again to 24. These were not enormous numbers, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of Covid-19 patients in Scotland relative to its population, and one of the highest in the UK. \"I think we were top of the graph possibly in the world at one point,\" says Dickson. As Dickson sees it, this early spike was, in part, testament to the efficiency of the contact tracing teams. A dedicated Covid ward had already been set aside at the hospital. But compared to Orkney and the Western Isles, which had largely been unaffected at that point, Shetland stood out - and Shetlanders were understandably anxious. Dickson believes this was a crucial factor in containing the outbreak; it meant islanders were already taking social distancing seriously before controls on movements were enforced. \"It's a difficult thing to say, but I think having those cases early on enabled us to move possibly more quickly than had we not had cases until later on in the pandemic,\" he says. \"My family live down in Brighton and if you went down to the beach there a week before the lockdown occurred you wouldn't have known anything was different. In Shetland, things have been different pretty much from day one.\" As early as 11 and 12 March, two Up Helly Aa fire festivals - hugely important events in Shetland's social calendar - were called off, in response to appeals from the health board. The following day, while the Cheltenham Gold Cup was going ahead as planned 700 miles away, it was announced that nearly all Shetland's schools would close from 16 March - a week before the rest of the country. Cafes, bars, restaurants and leisure centres were already shutting down across the islands long before the Scottish and Westminster government imposed their lockdowns, says Maggie Sandison, chief executive of the Shetland Islands Council. \"I think there's a really strong sense of community in Shetland,\" says Sandison. Naturally, islanders were anxious to do the right thing by their neighbours. But also, because such a high proportion of the population knew each other, \"people were aware that they may have come into contact with somebody who then became a positive case\" - and this in turn meant they knew to self-isolate. Sandison says the early decision to close schools was taken in part because some teachers had been part of the contact tracing teams and were advised to stay home after coming into face-to-face contact with people who had tested positive. On a sparsely populated group of islands, this was enough to put a strain on staffing levels. At the same time, \"there was quite heightened anxiety from parents\" some of whom were keeping their children at home already. Ferry operators also began preventing tourists and non-residents from travelling to the islands before nationwide restrictions were brought in. \"Because the transport links with the mainland were reduced early on, and the transport operators are only taking people who have essential reasons for travel, this has to some extent isolated the islands,\" says Laidlaw. A weekly Covid-19 Facebook livestream hosted by Dickson would attract as many as 600 viewers at a time. And Shetland's community spirit wasn't just about locking down and staying vigilant. When laundry staff at the hospital found they had a shortage of scrubs, a sewing pattern was posted on Facebook along with an appeal to turn any unwanted bedsheets into medical clothing. \"We had bags and bags of finished scrubs within days,\" says a personal assistant working for NHS Shetland, 38-year-old Lisa Grey, who oversaw the Shetland Scrubs project. As well as bringing extra colour to the wards, superhero patterns on erstwhile children's duvet covers proved especially popular with medical staff. \"You can see it when you're flicking through Facebook - folk saying, 'If anyone needs shopping, I'm off tomorrow.' If anyone needs help, there will always be someone that'll help,\" Grey says. With the rest of Scotland and the UK soon following Shetland's example in locking down, and many other Covid-19 clusters emerging around the UK, the islands felt less like an outlier. But as March turned to April the archipelago's cases kept rising, and before long it would report its first death. Word had spread quickly around the islands that the Malcolmsons had been the first to test positive; Iain had never expected otherwise. \"One thing about Shetland is you have absolutely no anonymity,\" he says. \"People know you're the person that's brought it in.\" To Iain, it was understandable, in a perverse way, when rumours about his family began to circulate on social media. Their names hadn't been officially released, and \"in the absence of fact, people just make stuff up\", he says. \"That's never going to change. There's always a few idiots out there.\" As he hadn't been looking at Facebook, it was news to him when friends got in touch to say the family was \"getting a serious amount of flak\". According to the gossip, on the weekend he and his wife had been tested, \"we were everywhere - we were out on pub crawls, we were out at concerts,\" says Iain. \"That weekend we did everything in Shetland that everyone else was doing. And I don't know why, but they were totally convinced that they'd seen us there.\" It was bad enough when it was confined to Facebook. Then tabloid journalists began calling the house. Iain's friends and family were feeling the pressure. They urged him to go on Facebook and correct the record. Iain really didn't want to do it. He wasn't a big social media person. What if it backfired? Might this not antagonise people further? But something needed to be said. Late one evening, Iain sat down at his computer and began typing. \"After some of the hardest few days we have ever experienced, and it is only getting harder, it is with a heavy heart that Suzanne and I feel it is necessary to put straight some of the more vicious rumours that are circulating about us on social media in Shetland,\" he wrote. After being told they were to be tested and advised to self-isolate, \"we have not left the house since and have not been out partying, or socialising of any kind\". The response was overwhelmingly positive. The post was shared over 1,000 times; friends and neighbours backed up their account; the record was duly corrected. Iain didn't bear a grudge - this was what happened in the absence of reliable information. \"It showed you the good side and the bad side of social media.\" According to National Records of Scotland (NRS), the first death of a person in Shetland with Covid-19 took place some time between 30 March and 5 April. Five more came the following week; a sixth the week after that. On 6 May, another death was announced; there have been no more since then. Tragically, five of the seven were in a single care home. Shetland has good reason to hope it has seen its last coronavirus death of the current peak. The last time a resident of the islands tested positive was 20 April - since then, the total number of confirmed cases has stood still at 54. Nine days afterwards, Dickson told Shetland's local media that the outbreak there may have \"plateaued\". \"They've obviously managed to control the virus by doing an early lockdown,\" says Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, who has advised the Scottish and UK governments. \"Full marks to them, really. Whatever they did worked.\" Shetland's isolation and lack of new cases makes it, along with Orkney, effectively \"a very small-scale New Zealand\", says Prof Pennington - and like New Zealand, he says, the islands could in theory lift their lockdowns by strictly controlling who comes and goes. But the islands' authorities are cool on the idea of a New Zealand-style quarantine. Dickson notes how many patients have to travel to Aberdeen for routine, non-Covid medical treatment: \"So are we saying those people aren't able to go to the mainland because we've closed our borders?\" It's also necessary for the fishing and oil industries for some people to have the ability to travel in and out. It's not just winter and spring events like the Up Helly Aa festivals that have been postponed though, as a result of the lockdown. In 2020 the long summer days will pass on the islands without sheepdog trials, the accordion and fiddle festival, Shetland Wool Week. And there's no end in sight - the first fire festival of 2021 has already been cancelled. The absence of tourists is also being keenly felt. \"My business wouldn't exist without tourism,\" says Lynn Johnson, who runs the Cake Fridge tea room on a single-track road between Voe and Aith on West Shetland Mainland's northern coast. To keep it going, she needs both the lockdown to be lifted and travel to resume. \"We really, really need that spring, summer, along with the big tourism boost that our islands get, to see us through the winter. And we're not going to have that at all.\" But for now, the lockdown is holding. Shetland is ready to resume contact tracing - which was halted in late March, as in the rest of the UK - and Laidlaw says the islands are well prepared for the next phase. Since late April, Shetland has had its own Covid-19 testing equipment, meaning samples no longer have to be sent to the mainland. And two small planes - like the one Iain flew back from holiday on - have been converted into air ambulances. In spite of the apparent success of Shetland's track-and-trace operation, no-one may ever know how the virus arrived there. Iain and his wife may have been the first people on Shetland to have tested positive, but that doesn't mean they were the first to bring it. \"Obviously I know about the contact tracing, the Malcomsons and their experience,\" says Dickson. \"We picked up those people who were diagnosed and got a positive result. I always say, those are the ones we know about. Shetland is a small community but we do have people who come in and out of the islands frequently.\" The couple most likely travelled in with the virus, but \"what we can't guarantee is they were the only people\". And there is no guarantee the Malcolmsons caught the virus in Italy either, as it is thought to have been circulating in Edinburgh, where they changed flights, since February. Iain knows better than most the importance of social distancing. And he knows he's fortunate to being doing so in Shetland, where keeping apart from others is easier. \"It's absolutely beautiful,\" he says. \"You feel like you're on holiday. You have to be pretty disciplined about actually working. But this could be our summer, so you have to make hay while the sun shines.\" Follow @mrjonkelly on Twitter"

By the time she welcomed back pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6, every classroom looked very different. It's particularly striking for the youngest pupils:. \"They've got their own little tables,\" says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. \"Obviously they're used to spending a lot of time on the carpet,\" Each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much. On arrival the parents queue with their children in the playground, which has been marked into two-metre sections, and each year group has been asked to arrive at a different time. They don't have to wait long. \"You look like you've grown, Arthur,\" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a Reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. \"Are you excited to be back?\" Ms Frostick asks another. She was expecting to welcome 70 pupils, who were last in school in late March, alongside 15 children of key workers who have been coming in throughout the lockdown - but in the end just 32 turned up. Ms Frostick is not too surprised, given ongoing concerns about the health impact of reopening schools. She believes many parents are waiting to see how it goes - so numbers may pick up in coming days. These primary school classrooms now look a little like they might have done in the 1950s with all the desks facing forward in rows, instead of being pushed together into big tables. For Year 6 pupils, it's a foretaste of the discipline they might expect when they start secondary school in September. \"I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,\" says 11-year-old Sean. He says he has kept up with the home schooling \"but it's nowhere near the amount we normally do\". His classmate Ruby, also 11, quite likes the new desk arrangement as it gives her a bit more personal space. \"It could be better because sometimes people can be annoying.\" Sean agrees it will be better for concentration but says \"partner work\" will now be impossible. The school has split each class into two separate \"bubbles\" with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. Ruby says she will miss some of the people in the other group. School will be \"way different\", she says. Dora, who is not due in until Thursday, is quite disappointed. \"I was looking forward to seeing all my friends again; it's been over two months since I last saw them at school. \"And then I found out I was only going to see three of my friends because the rest of them are put together in the other group. \"It isn't long until the end of primary school and I'm worried I wont be able to see my friends before we're all sent off to different secondary schools.\" One thing is for sure - hand washing is going to play a far larger part in the school day than ever before. Every classroom has its own supply of hand-sanitiser and anti-microbial wipes - and the windows are wide open to let in as much fresh air as possible to keep the virus at bay. Sophia was one of the parents who did decide to bring her children in to school on Monday, \"It really is best for the family,\" she says. She says she has managed to do some home schooling with her sons Nico, nearly five, and Alessio, 6, but it hasn't always been easy. Julia, who was dropping off six-year-old Max, agrees. \"I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,\" she says of her decision. \"The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back.\" Ruby and Sean agree they have definitely missed being taught by professional teachers rather than mums and dads. \"I call my mum over and she says: 'What is this?'\" says Sean - while his dad can sometimes be a bit confusing when he comes up with \"an easier way\" of doing the maths. School governor and parent Serena, whose son is also in Year 6, says she too struggled with home education as her two sons have to share a single computer. She says she is confident that the school has done a very stringent risk assessment and says her boy needs more structure in his life in the run-up to secondary school. But preparing to reopen has been challenging, as it was one thing deciding to send her own child back but far tougher to make decisions on behalf of the wider school community. \"The virus is such an unknown. It's been quite stressful. I feel a great deal of responsibility,\" says Serena. President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window For almost two months, religious groups have been unable to attend their normal places of worship, as mosques, churches, synagogues and temples remain shut under government coronavirus rules. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick warned at Sunday's No 10 briefing that \"large gatherings in places of worship, particularly because of the demographic in some faiths, because of singing hymns and so on - which can lead to exhalation - can create particular problems.\" And the government's scientific advisers say some form of social distancing is likely to be in place for many months to come. So what is the future of religious worship in the UK with ongoing social distancing? As faith leaders consider a return to their religious buildings, some fear their returning communities will be traumatised by the ban on communal worship. \"Emotionally we will be broken, without a shadow of a doubt,\" says Sheikh Nuru Mohammed, one of the UK's most senior imams, who is planning his return to the KSIMC Shi'ite mosque in Birmingham. In many religious communities, there is a theological requirement that certain rituals are performed communally. Sheikh Muhammed says Friday prayers - the most significant of the week for both Sunni and Shia Muslims - can only fully take place communally in the mosque. Meanwhile in Catholicism, the Mass is central to worship and involves the physical consumption of bread and wine. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the most senior Catholic in England and Wales, has spoken of the \"pain\" and \"deep spiritual sacrifice being made\" in withholding Holy Communion. As part of Northern Ireland's five-stage plan to ease its lockdown, drive-in church services can now be held and churches can open for private prayer with appropriate social distancing. Dr Mehrunisha Suleman, an Islamic academic at the University of Oxford, says Muslim tradition and teaching allows for changes to be made. \"There's a lot of flexibility within the theological, the ethical and the legal tradition, about being able to adapt practices to be able to accommodate for circumstances like this,\" she says. The suggestion of flexibility to allow traditional religious practices to change and adapt to new coronavirus regulations is being seen in other faiths as well. Tilak Parekh, an academic and expert in Hindu theology, says he is seeing an increasing amount of innovation in how traditional ceremonies are allowed to happen. The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, commonly known as the \"Neasden Temple\", in north-west London, is enabling families to carry out the funeral rituals at home which were traditionally done by a swami, or priest, with a large crowd attending. \"All of a sudden now we see concessions, we see adaptations, we see innovations,\" he says. \"If one was to suggest this a year ago there would have been protests; 'Oh no, this is how we've always done it. This is the traditional way.' \"People have changed the way they practise.\" Across different faiths, religious leaders are exploring the implications of having to change long-held beliefs and practices. Communal singing is a common aspect of worship across religions, particularly in Christian denominations. But as churches in Germany have reopened with social distancing, singing remains banned due to the fear it could cause infected droplets from people's mouths to remain in the air for longer and travel further. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, Bishop of London, is leading Church of England planning on how to reopen its buildings after lockdown. \"Our future is going to be very different for a very long time,\" she says. \"There are some very challenging questions that we will have to face, not least about singing and about receiving Holy Communion.\" And what about the Islamic pilgrimage - Hajj - which is due to take place in the summer? Typically more than two million pilgrims attend the rituals, which are spread over five days in and around Makkah, the main holy city in Saudi Arabia. There are several aspects of Hajj that public health experts worry could cause a surge in infections. For example, the mosque in Makkah as well as Hajj sites in Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat, have shared washing facilities so pilgrims can prepare for prayer. Social distancing would be impossible, experts warn, unless there was a drastic reduction in numbers. Similarly, pilgrims are banned from covering their face or head during the prayers, making face masks impossible unless there is an edict to change Islamic law. Dr Suleman warns that, if Saudi Arabia reduces the numbers allowed to attend Hajj, there will be long-term implications for Muslims' ability to fulfil their pilgrimage duties, especially those who have waited a long time to go or who might struggle to afford it allowing fewer people to go made the Hajj more expensive. She adds that Islamic scholars will be exploring ways to adapt Hajj requirements to allow for stricter public health measures. Despite the sadness and widespread concern, there are some positives for religious communities. The Rt Rev Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said the virus offered an opportunity to address inequalities in society. \"Just because we're in the middle of a crisis, it doesn't mean that we can't have a vision for a future where justice and righteousness are the keystones of our common life,\" he said. \"We can do it now in a way we've never been able to [before]. We must be brave and courageous in setting our vision for what society will be.\" President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\". 15 sayings from around the world"

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis have spread across the US and to other countries. They've been documented in videos, images and posts on social media. But some of these aren't what they claim to be. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been tracking misleading videos and conspiracy theories about the protests, which have been circulating online. So, here's what to look out for - and avoid - on your social media feeds. We've seen lots of examples of old video surfacing in recent days, adding to the confusion online. A video of a teenager being violently arrested by a US police officer has generated almost 10 million views in the last few days. But the incident happened back in April - in Rancho Cordova, a city in Northern California. This wasn't made clear in the latest post that has been retweeted more than 100,000 times. It also wrongly identifies the teenager as female. The clip attracted widespread criticism at the time and prompted an investigation into the police officer's conduct. Meanwhile, there is genuine footage from the current protests which has led to allegations of police brutality. Video from the US shows police using batons and tear gas on protesters and journalists seemingly unprovoked. A video of a young African-American woman speaking out against police brutality has been circulating online. However, the video is from a protest in 2016 against the shooting of Alton Sterling. Again, people are attributing it to the latest protests in the US, or not making it clear the footage is from 2016. On May 28th a 'Crime News and Media' site posted the video, and titled it \"No Justice No Peace\" \u2014 \"Black Girl Says She's Tired Of Being Peaceful Amid Protests In Minneapolis\". This had more than 14,000 views and hundreds of comments. This video claims to show a US police building on fire and was posted on 28 May. It's not only old - it's from 2015 - it was filmed in another country. It shows an explosion in the Chinese city of Tianjin. Similar clips of the same incident have also appeared in recent months in connection with the coronavirus. So, why are people sharing old videos? \"The videos may be compounding the anger they are feeling and could be driven by attempts to sow division or get clicks,\" says Marianna Spring, BBC Specialist Disinformation and Social Media reporter. Speculation about who's behind the protests have been circulating online. Some claims are unsubstantiated, others totally false - and they're often being shared by those looking to point the finger of blame elsewhere. First up, posts that have gone viral about George Soros. Some influential right-wing figures have made unfounded claims that the Hungarian-American billionaire is \"funding\" the demonstrations. According to these claims, Mr Soros' motive for \"paying up\" protesters is to instigate a \"race war\" and bring President Trump's government down. Supporters of QAnon - a conspiracy theory about a \"deep state\" secret coup against Donald Trump - have shared similar claims. Since then, more than a million posts and memes on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram have repeated allegations about Mr Soros paying agitators to cause trouble. Mr Soros, whose Open Society Foundations provide financial support to a number of civil society groups and progressive projects around the world, has been a bogeyman of some on the right for a long time. His organisation has responded to the latest posts, tweeting that \"Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest\". Claims have circulated online about Russia's involvement in the protests. Viral tweets with thousands of shares suggest that Russia was involved in George Floyd's death - as part of a military operation or an elaborate plot. There is no evidence to support these claims. This isn't to rule out the idea that Russia or other countries - either through state media outlets or networks of fake accounts - could be involved in stoking tensions online. Investigations into Russian interference during the 2016 US Presidential election revealed that Russia was involved in a misinformation campaign, infiltrating groups and pages run by US activists - and that included Black Lives Matter groups. There have also been unsubstantiated claims that pro-independence protesters from Hong Kong are somehow involved. The editor-in-chief of China's state-owned Global Times newspaper Hu Xijin tweeted accusations that protesters from Hong Kong might have been linked to the violence in the US: \"Vicious HK rioters obviously are masterminds of violent protests across the US\". But China's foreign ministry has warned against comparing the two sets of protests.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Once a penniless painter on the boulevards of Paris, nobody did art like Christo. The charismatic Eastern European refugee became world famous for monumental installations, covering huge objects in miles of fabric and rope. Every project was preposterous in concept, taking decades to design, finance and deliver. He wrapped enormous buildings, avenues of trees, entire coastlines and island chains. Each one cost millions with official permission almost impossible to get. Yet, when finally completed, they were gone again in a matter of weeks. It was a life of herculean tasks. His determination to see them through never dimmed. Even in his eighties, he was working on a scheme to rival the pharaohs. A vast stairway to heaven in the deserts of Abu Dhabi, made from 410,000 brightly coloured oil barrels. A final, grand statement larger than the Great Pyramid itself. Christo Vladimirov Javacheff was born on 13 June 1935 in Gabrovo, a small town in the Bulgarian mountains. His father Ivan was a chemist who ran a factory making fabrics. His mother, Tzeta Dimitrova, a political activist. Their social circle was one of artists and intellectuals, the household a swirl of radical ideas questioning the boundaries of contemporary culture. A bohemian childhood, where artistic creativity was encouraged from the start, was constantly disrupted by war. As a boy, Christo saw his country first brutally uprooted; first by the Nazis and then the Russians. Politics, as well as art, shaped his early years. In 1952, he attended the Art Academy in Sofia. There he was expected to join the Communist Youth and produce realistic, anti-capitalist work glorifying the values of socialism. He turned out the kind of populist propaganda pieces the system demanded. But he found it suffocating. \"The work of art,\" he would say, \"is a scream of freedom.\" He moved to Prague, got into theatre design and immersed himself in the works of great artists; Miro, Matisse, Kandinsky. When the Hungarian revolution broke out, he saw students and intellectuals like himself dealt with ruthlessly. So he fled. Bribing a railway worker, he hid on a train taking medicine to Austria. He made it to Vienna but found himself officially stateless - dirt poor and unable to speak the language in a Europe awash with refugees. A few years later, he washed up in Paris. He scraped a living painting portraits on the street, something he likened to prostitution. A woman saw an example at the hairdressers and liked it, inviting the struggling artist to her chateaux to paint a picture of her. The woman's daughter was flame-haired Jeanne-Claude. She would become Christo's wife, his muse, his voice and life-long business partner and creative soul mate. \"Mother's brought home another stray,\" she thought at the time. Fortunately, that first impression didn't last. He showed her his 'real work'. In 1920, Man Ray had wrapped a sewing machine with a blanket, appropriating an everyday object and making it art. Profoundly influenced, Christo's garret was stuffed floor-to-ceiling with similar pieces. \"My God\", she recalled thinking. \"This guy is crazy!\" She got pregnant and married a more suitable man but walked out after three weeks. She and Christo were never apart again. Jeanne-Claude's father, a four-star general in the French army, didn't speak to her for years. What followed was an extraordinary artistic collaboration lasting more than 50 years. At first, their work was credited to Christo alone, feeling that it was easier for one person's name to become established. Only latterly did Jeanne-Claude's contribution get the equal billing it deserved. She encouraged him away from small objects in favour of the monumental.  In 1962, reacting to the building of the Berlin Wall, they blocked off the Rue Visconti in Paris with a pile of oil drums some 4m high.  They begged the police to let it stand for a while but within hours it had gone. They moved to New York, living in an illegal squat as undocumented migrants.  He began producing the sketches and project plans they sold to finance their creations.  She took on the logistics and gathered the necessary permissions. In 1969, they wrapped more than 2km of coastline in Little Bay, Australia.  In places, the cliffs soared to more than 26m high.  It took an hour to walk from one end of the installation to the other. Next, they created a fabric fence in California - nearly 40km long and 6m high.  Nine lawyers were hired to persuade dozens of local farmers to give their blessing. In 1983, the couple surrounded 11 islands in Miami's Biscayne Bay with more than 600,000 square metres of bright pink polypropylene.  The material was individually cut to fit each shoreline.  Four hundred people were needed to put everything into place. Walkways were sewn into the fabric for the public.  The 'exhibit' was up for just two weeks, then all 11km of it was taken down. Christo and Jeanne-Claude wanted their works to be joyful and beautiful, encouraging the observer to see the familiar anew.  But they refused to give these vast creations any 'meaning' past an immediate aesthetic impact. The direct impact on the environment was controversial.  The couple were careful to recycle everything they used.  And none of it was built to last. Its temporary nature was a key part of the concept. Like the rainbow, its momentary existence was what made it all so wonderful. \"They all go away when they're finished,\" Christo once said of his creations. \"Only the preparatory drawings and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character.  I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain.\" Up to a point, perhaps. The site-specific creations might have been designed with a fleeting wow factor in mind, but as a body of work they spoke to important themes - impact on the environment, 20th Century human conflict, and the need for perseverance in defence of freedom of expression. In 1984, they wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. It took them nine years to persuade the mayor, Jacques Chirac, to let them do it.  Forty thousand metres of golden sandstone fabric was used, chosen to imitate colour of the pavements at sunset. Next was a $26m project to erect thousands of huge umbrellas - blue ones in Japan, yellow ones in southern California.  They were paid for, as always, by the sale of Christo's drawings.  They never accepted sponsorship, which would have imposed unacceptable limitations on their art.  Three million came to look and picnic in the shade. Years of lobbying came to fruition in 1995, when the German parliament allowed them to spread 100,000m of fireproof material around the Reichstag.  All tied down with 15km of rope. The most difficult was the one closest to home.  Its title, The Gates, Central Park, New York 1979-2005, referred to the years it had taken them to persuade the city to let them do it. In February 2005, more than 7,000 gates made from saffron coloured fabric were finally placed along the paths that wind through the Big Apple's green lung.  Together, they formed a fluttering trail 37km long.  Five million came to be amazed.  A week later, everything was packed away. Jeanne-Claude died in 2009 after complications following a brain aneurysm. For years she had been seen as little more than Christo's business partner and PR manager.  In reality, they were two sides of the same creative coin, travelling in different planes so that, if one died, their artistic vision would survive. Without her, Christo pushed on with their unfinished projects.  In 2016, he installed a series of walkways on Lake Iseo near Brescia, Italy. Visitors could walk for more than 3km, just above the calm surface of the waters, from the mainland to the islands of Monte Isola and San Pedro. \"The most beautiful part,\" he said, \"is about the people walking nowhere.  It's not like going to the shop, not going to see your friends.  It's really going nowhere.\" Despite his claim his work was nothing more than the impact of the aesthetic on the human senses, Christo will be remembered for a body of work that pushed artistic boundaries. He challenged the idea that sculpture has be something fixed and permanent.  He deliberately blurred the line between art and its natural environment.  And he did it on a truly epic scale. His death means we will never see all his visions come to reality.  There were plenty that never made it past the drawing board.  Even decades of lobbying never let him wrap some of the skyscrapers in New York. He cancelled a plan to cover the Colorado River, despite spending $14m getting permission, in protest at the election of Donald Trump. A plan to wrap the Arc de Triomphe in Paris is still set to go ahead next year, but who knows if his scheme in the desert will ever make it from design stage to reality in his absence? It is intended to be 500ft high, with a base the size of the piazza at St Peter's in Rome. And this one, the only one of all his projects, was designed to be permanent.  A lasting tribute to an extraordinary creative partnership whose every scheme was more innovative, ambitious and dauntingly complicated than the last.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window \"There's a big black sky over my town.\" That line from Dancing On My Own is Robyn's love letter to the weather in her home city of Stockholm, Sweden. It's one of her two favourite lyrics from the track, which has just turned ten years old. It also happens to be my favourite song of all time. That means I've spent a decade of dancing and singing to it at clubs, festivals and in friends' kitchens. It's soundtracked some of the most personal moments in my life. Under recent lockdown, it's been viewed in another new light with an accompanying TikTok challenge from Robyn herself. Like many other people, I love the bittersweet combination of hearing something so uplifting yet so heartbreaking. There are so many highlights but Robyn tells me her other favourite line is: \"I just wanna dance all night.\" At that point in the song, she's already taken us to the club where we're watching her ex kiss a new partner. We've all been there, right? She says it represents the precise moment on the dancefloor when you have to get your \"desperation, frustration and sadness out\". It's been described as the \"ultimate sad banger\". End of Youtube post  by RobynVEVO With its multiple cover versions and the number of films and TV shows it's popped up in, the song is considered a classic with outlets like Rolling Stone, NME and Stereogum all ranking it as the best song of the last decade. By 2010, Robyn had transformed from mid-1990s major label pop star into a fiercely independent artist with her own record label, Konichiwa Records. With Every Heartbeat had also given her a UK number one single in 2007. Dancing On My Own was her first new music in years and the lead single from the first of her three Body Talk albums, which she released over six months. \"I knew I wanted to make a song called Dancing On My Own,\" Robyn tells Radio 1 Newsbeat, from her apartment in Stockholm. \"I just didn't know what it was going to be about.\" With an idea of a chorus in her mind, Robyn started working with Swedish producer Patrik Berger, who she'd collaborated with on her previous album. At the beginning, Patrik remembers the song having an acoustic vibe. The chorus came first and \"everything else fell into place and it felt like it was writing itself\". Patrik admits they were \"super picky\" about every aspect of the song and he recently found a notebook with hundreds of lyrics that were written and scrapped along the way. \"Every single word needed to feel right,\" he tells Newsbeat. His favourite lyric is \"I know where you're at, I bet she's around\" which he feels represents the \"self-destructive part of you, when we know we shouldn't go there. It's like scratching a wound.\" Robyn also remembers Patrik spending a lot of time on the individual components of the song: the drums, the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with. \"We kept building and it kept getting better and better and better,\" she says. \"It was an exciting session. I remember sending the demo to the record label and telling them I thought we had a good single.\" Robyn says she's proud of Dancing On My Own because it features elements of \"many different worlds\" she loves including: \"Prince songs, 80s rock ballads and queer electronica\". The song was a hit. Dancing On My Own made number eight in the UK Singles Chart. It went on to top year-end critics' polls, Robyn performed it on TV shows around the world and it was nominated for a Grammy. Then came the first of Robyn's two defining moments in the life of her song. We'll get to the second later. In 2012, it was used in the first season of HBO's Girls, the TV comedy drama created by Lena Dunham. Robyn says the use of the song was \"genius\" while Lena Dunham tells Newsbeat it was \"magical\". In the episode, Lena's character Hannah finds out her ex-boyfriend is gay. She's sat in her flat and Dancing On My Own starts up on her laptop. Her best friend Marnie (Alison Williams) comes home and they dance in Hannah's bedroom to the track, which then plays over the end credits. \"That moment on set was meant to be so brief and so light,\" says Lena. \"But it took on so much importance because it marked the first time myself and Alison felt comfortable in our characters.\" Off camera she says the whole crew was dancing and people were crying. \"You could feel the power and love that went into the song.\" When Lena accepted her Golden Globe for best actress in 2013, Dancing On My Own was playing as she walked to the stage collect it. \"It was like having a companion in that very public moment.\" Dancing On My Own has also been featured in Gossip Girl, Orange Is The New Black, RuPaul's Drag Race, movies Teen Spirit and Long Shot, and the Masked Singer USA. It's also been covered multiple times by artists including Kings Of Leon and Kelly Clarkson. \"I really like Kelly's version,\" says Robyn. \"She has a really powerful voice. She recorded one of my favourite Max Martin songs, Since U Been Gone, which I covered in the Radio 1 Live Lounge. So that's funny.\" But its most famous cover is by Calum Scott, who gave the song a second lease of life. In 2015, the British singer auditioned for Britain's Got Talent with a stripped-back version of the track, the video of which has now been viewed  288 million times. \"I fell in love with the song instantly,\" he says. \"I was about 21 when it was originally released and it came at the height of me figuring out my personality.\" He points to the lyric \"I'm right over here, why can't you see me?\" as the precise moment he connected to the song. Calum struggled with his sexuality growing up. He says Dancing On My Own became his anthem. \"I didn't really know who I was, so when I sang it all those emotions from my past spilled over into the song.\" End of Youtube post  by CalumScottVEVO Calum's version was released commercially in 2016 and performed better than Robyn's original, reaching number two in the UK singles chart. \"I owe my career to Robyn,\" he says. He also describes the \"surreal moment\" when the two of them met - by chance - at the BBC. \"She walked past and I just froze. She came up to me and said it was nice to finally meet me. You never expect to meet the person who had the original song\". NO WORDS. \u2764\ufe0f @robynkonichiwa A post shared by  Calum Scott (@calumscott) on Dec 4, 2018 at 4:41am PST End of Instagram post  by calumscott Robyn says Calum and his voice interpreted it in a way that \"made the song came alive again\". \"I'm super happy for him to have the success and am pleased people got to know the song a little bit more\". She says there have been so many covers because \"it's a great song\". But as Calum was bringing the song to a far wider audience in the mid-2010s, Robyn was taking a step back from what she'd created. \"Dancing On My Own sometimes felt like a teenage version of me that I was happy to let go of,\" she says. The song came from a break-up in her own life and she became \"tired of the broken heart\". \"I went through a lot of therapy, worked on myself and healed myself. \"Now I'm back loving it. I don't feel conflicted and I love performing it and playing it live.\" End of Youtube post  by Robyn When Robyn toured in 2019, she cut the song just before the chorus, leaving thousands of fans to sing her track back at her. I was at her gig at London's Alexandra Palace. It was such a goosebump moment to join everyone else singing \"I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her\" at the tops of our voices. At the time, I remember Robyn seemed to be genuinely overwhelmed by it. \"It's like the song was talking back to me,\" she says. By that point, she felt the song had moved on from its beginnings and \"became something that took on meaning for a lot of people in different ways\". For someone that often writes about heartbreak and emotions, Robyn says she finds nostalgia and sentimentality \"difficult\". \"Those emotions don't always feel true to me and I think Dancing On My Own has those qualities. \"It's maybe a part of the song I had to struggle with. But maybe that's why it connects to so many people too.\" In February, Robyn was named Songwriter of the Decade at the NME Awards, an accolade handed to her by Christine & The Queens and Charli XCX. Charli says Robyn \"continuously evolved\" in her career but \"has always stayed true to who she is\". H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier of Christine & The Queens described her songwriting as \"pop perfection\". \"As a songwriter I can only marvel at a song like Dancing On My Own,\" says Letissier. \"It's a gem of pop. I watched her gig in Oslo last year and it was the most cathartic thing I ever saw.\" As we mentioned earlier, Robyn has a second defining moment of the track. It involves her friend and collaborator Max Martin, who himself has co-written 22 Billboard Hot 100 number ones and played an early part in her career on songs like Show Me Love. According to Robyn, she was told by his manager that Max thinks \"it's one of the best pop songs ever made\". \"And that makes me very happy and proud.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The hacker collective was once a regular fixture in the news, targeting those it accused of injustice with cyber-attacks. After years of relative quiet, it appears to have re-emerged in the wake of violent protests in Minneapolis over the death of George Floyd, promising to expose the \"many crimes\" of the city's police to the world. However, it's not easy to pin down what, if anything, is genuinely the mysterious group's work. The \"hacktivist\" collective has no face, and no leadership. Its tagline is simply \"we are legion\", referring to its allegedly large numbers of individuals. Without any central command structure, anyone can claim to be a part of the group. This also means that members can have wildly different priorities, and there is no single agenda. But generally, they are activists, taking aim at those they accuse of misusing power. They do so in very public ways, such as hijacking websites or forcing them offline. Their symbol is a Guy Fawkes mask, made famous by Alan Moore's graphic novel V for Vendetta, in which an anarchist revolutionary dons the mask to topple a corrupt fascist government. Various forms of cyber-attack are being attributed to Anonymous in relation to the George Floyd protests. First, the Minneapolis police department website was temporarily taken offline over the weekend in a suspected Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. This is an unsophisticated but effective form of cyber-attack that floods a server with data until it can't keep up and stops working - in the same way that shopping websites can go offline when too many people flood it to snap up high-demand products. A database of email addresses and passwords claiming to be hacked from the police department's system is also in circulation, and being linked to Anonymous. However, there is no evidence that the police servers have been hacked and one researcher, Troy Hunt, says the credentials are likely to have been compiled from older data breaches. What we almost certainly have here is the result of someone selecting every https://t.co/PLqgtO3KjG email address from old breaches or credential stuffing lists and passing it off as something it isn't. There's no evidence whatsoever to suggest this is legitimate. End of Twitter post  by @troyhunt A page on the website of a minor United Nations agency has been turned into a memorial for Mr Floyd, replacing its contents with the message \"Rest in Power, George Floyd\", along with an Anonymous logo. On Twitter, unverified posts have also gone viral, apparently showing police radios playing music and preventing communication. However, experts suggest it is unlikely to be a hack, and could instead be the result of a stolen piece of hardware being commandeered by protesters on the scene - if the videos are genuine in the first place. Anonymous activists are also circulating years-old accusations against President Trump, taken from documents in a civil court case that was voluntarily dismissed by the accuser before it went to trial. Despite there being no single unified approach among Anonymous' members, the group has targeted groups over race relations in the past. In 2014, when the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, prompted widespread protests, members of Anonymous threatened to target the city if protesters were harmed. They then disabled the city's website, compromising communications at city hall, and targeting the city's police chief. Later that year, they \"declared war\" on the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), releasing personal details of alleged members online. Some Anonymous members also attacked the campaign group Black Lives Matter's website over alleged \"anti-white racism\". George Floyd's death has led to what the BBC's New York correspondent Nick Bryant described as the most widespread racial turbulence and civil unrest since the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968. It is against this backdrop that a Facebook page claiming to be linked to Anonymous released a video about Mr Floyd's death, alleging a string of other crimes involving Minneapolis police, and threatening to act. The same Facebook page posted similar videos about UFOs and \"China's plan for world domination\" in recent weeks which - like the George Floyd video - feature an electronically-disguised voice discussing previously published news stories. But it received much wider attention after the Minneapolis police department's website appeared to be knocked offline. The first major Anonymous operation to make headlines was against the Church of Scientology in 2008, in which it used DDoS attacks to knock some of the organisation's websites offline, along with prank calls and empty fax messages designed to disrupt their communications. In the years that followed, in the aftermath of a global financial crisis, the group acted in support of the Arab Spring protest movements, targeted Sony Entertainment over its attempt to crack down on hacking of the PlayStation 3 console, and supported the Occupy Wall Street protests, among others. They have continued to lend support to similar causes, and staged anti-establishment rallies around the world, but their prominence in mainstream media had diminished in recent years. The revolutionary image and willingness to take on powerful entities, however, appears to be striking a chord during the current crisis in the United States.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window For many of us, our homes have become our workplaces over the past few months, and a full return to the office still appears a remote prospect. Major tech companies say they are open to their staff working from home permanently. Employees are coming to realise remote working is not only possible but, in some cases, preferable. A shift to a new way of working might already be under way. Such a shift could have profound implications on our home life, and by extension on the life of our towns and cities: almost a quarter of all office space in England and Wales is in central London alone. To understand those implications, we brought together four experts on city life, all of whom were working from home. Paul Cheshire, professor of economic geography, London School of Economics: I do think we'll go back to offices but not in the same way. People are more productive when they are closer together with face-to-face contact. There's 20 years of really good persuasive research demonstrating how important that is. There are lots of things you cannot do except with other people - people are innately social animals. Les Back, professor of sociology, Goldsmiths: I do think we are at a tipping point. There's a reorientation, a recalibration of the relationship between place and time and social life that we're on the cusp of. We may see profound changes. Some things may not come back. Aude Bicquelet-Lock, deputy head of policy and research, Royal Town Planning Institute: It's true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever. Twitter said it. Facebook said it. The CEO of Barclays said that putting 7,000 people in the office might be a thing of the past. The experience of going to the office in Aberystwyth isn't the same as going to the office in London. The decline of office space will affect small, medium and large cities in different ways. Les Back: The hollowing-out of city life has been coming for a long time. It may be that what will happen is that some businesses won't come back to the centre of the city and think it's too risky - or there may be other economic drivers where people will just take the opportunity to ask: \"Why are we investing so much of our capital in these large office spaces?\" I think there are possibly huge effects [of more working from home]. There's the pressure on the domestic sphere. There's the pressure on gendered relationships at home, on the blurring and overlaying of parenting and work and the pressures that would cause. Aude Bicquelet-Lock: I think what we will see is that local centres may see more diversification - more dining, more social activities as people may want to meet each other. Also working from home may mean getting access to workplaces in local towns for some days. Growth is to be expected in these areas. The contrary could apply to bigger cities, which of course raises the question of how the office space could be reused: there are several options, like turning offices into residential spaces, which hasn't always been done with absolute success. I also wonder whether we will need conference halls and other meeting spaces as we did in the past. Paul Cheshire: You will get more people working from home, which will mean there will be more demand for large houses. You have to have a workspace, which will push you out. You may need to move to commute maybe once a week, twice a week to your headquarters, wherever that is, for meetings. Therefore you'll accept a longer commute for cheaper space. You'll tend to move further away from the city centre. On the other hand, there will be people who have to stay in the offices, stay in the concentration, the social interaction, who will become even more strongly attracted to the city centre. But you will probably also get localised desk-sharing, specialised areas where people can go if you're a homeworker, where you can occasionally get better IT or better facilities or get away from your children. There will be an opening-up in smaller towns of hot-desking spaces. We will need more space. What you would be doing is opening land close to stations with good access to city centres. You could build a million houses on green belt land within 45 minutes of central London because there's so much green belt land. The fastest-growing places for people commuting to London are incredibly far away - Peterborough, York, Somerset. People are living miles out in order to get affordable land and more space. That will be accelerated. And it will be particularly accelerated unless we are willing to release land close to transport nodes that will give access to jobs. Margaret Bell, professor of transport and the environment, University of Newcastle: Our research has shown that in a study of commuting to Newcastle the 7% of trips over 50km were responsible for 60% of the carbon emissions. The further you travel, the more detrimental effect with emissions. Paul Cheshire: That's one of the ironies of the green belt: forcing people to commute further. Margaret Bell: My worry is people buying more cars and those who have cars will use them more. What we do need is incentives to use bicycles more and to get people to shift towards living closer to their work or workplaces, or arranging for people to go to work more locally. We need a bottom-up approach to understand people's needs and try and tailor the transport accordingly. Paul Cheshire: Housing, particularly in England, is very energy inefficient. There's quite a big carbon footprint with more time spent in the home because home heating and home insulation is far, far worse than modern commercial premises are. Margaret Bell: Some work we did in Leicester showed that if you work from home, on average you use 75% more energy than you save by not going into work. And that corresponds to a 75% increase in carbon dioxide - purely and simply because if you need heating and gas, electricity at home, that's more than what you save by not going into work by car. And so, coupled with the isolation effect, it's sensible for local businesses to open up their hot-desking offices, or even have reciprocal arrangements with companies where consultants working more out of town could reciprocate hot-desking in offices. Les Back: We are predominantly talking about people who work in finance service sectors, white-collar jobs and white-collar workers. That isn't the workforce of cities. What about hospital, school and other public sector jobs? Also, cities are important because they're places of encounter. Places of difference. That difference and the negotiations that happen across racial and cultural difference take on particular qualities in the centre of cities that are not the same in the outskirts and in the suburbs. Aude Bicquelet-Lock: Everyone will have gone through the lockdown and will have gone through the changes and had new habits and will have strong views about what it is they want, what works for them and what doesn't. And I think one of the first things we will have to do as urban planners and policymakers is listen to what they want. But there will be financial constraints. Paul Cheshire: The other issue is people's fear: how long will it take people to recover from the experience of being worried about being in crowds, being vulnerable. I think people will recover from that if there is a vaccine, if the virus subsides. If that happens, offices will reassert themselves and all those things we liked doing in city centres will also reassert themselves. That may take quite a long time. Office life for many has changed significantly. Some will choose to continue working from home, while for others shielding, they have no choice in the matter. But when space is at a premium and bedrooms have been turned into work spaces, we want to know what life hacks you've come up with to make the most of tiny areas you are now living and working in.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Libya looks to be at the end of one bleak chapter, but there is no guarantee that the next will be any better for a country that has been torn to pieces by civil war and foreign intervention since Col Muammar Gaddafi met his grisly death in 2011. Since last year Gen Khalifa Haftar, the strongman of eastern Libya, has been trying to capture the capital, Tripoli, in the far west of the vast country. Intervention by Turkey in support of the Tripoli government, recognised by the United Nations, looks to be decisive. Gen Haftar's men, along with a force of several thousand Russian mercenaries, are in retreat. But that does not mean that Libyan civilians can expect the peace they crave. Once again they are the biggest losers. Their country, richly endowed with oil and gas, should be able to guarantee them rights of which they can only dream: education; healthcare and a decent standard of living. They don't have any of them, or safety. Libyans who have not lost their homes have been locking down to prevent the spread of Covid-19, hoping they do not also become the target of artillery, drones or warplanes. The war has destroyed most of Libya's clinics and hospitals. Around 200,000 civilians in western Libya have already been displaced from their homes, according to Hanan Saleh of Human Rights Watch. In a recent webinar organised by the think-tank, Chatham House, Ms Saleh said that \"you have to look at Libya currently as an accountability-free zone and it has been that way unfortunately since 2011\". All parties in the war have been reckless in their treatment of civilians, though Gen Haftar's side, she said, has committed more documented abuses that could potentially be crimes of war. It is hard to believe now, but after Col Gaddafi was overthrown it looked for a while as if Libya might have a decent future. Back in 2011 I walked with the British ambassador through the ruins of his embassy in Tripoli; it had been attacked and torched by a mob after Nato started bombing the Gaddafi regime's forces. Next to the charred frame of what had been a 1920s billiard table, we talked about the pride that Libyans had in their revolution, their luck in not being cursed with significant sectarian differences like Syria or Iraq, and about the treasure house of oil and gas under the vast Libyan desert. Perhaps even tourism would be possible. Libya has 2,000 kilometres of Mediterranean beaches, and Roman archaeological sites that are the equal of anything in Italy. But Libya was broken, and in almost a decade since that conversation it has continued to fragment. You may be interested in: The militias that took on the Gaddafi regime never disbanded, and came to like their power. Once the colonel, his sons and the family's cronies were gone, no kind of functioning state was left. The men who acquired the important job titles found that if there were any levers of government to pull, they came away in their hands. Libyans who saw themselves as revolutionaries were in no mood to ask for much help from the powerful countries which had provided weapons and most importantly an air force to help them win. In turn, the outsiders were relieved to be able to turn away, declaring the job was well done. Removing Gaddafi was one thing. Helping to build a country was something very different. It did not take long for the remains of Libya to fall into even smaller pieces. The bigger towns became city-states. The militias had their own agendas and would not lay down their weapons. A series of diplomats, mostly under the auspices of the United Nations tried, unsuccessfully, to promote dialogue and reconciliation. By 2014 Gen Haftar had emerged as a power in the broken land, expelling radical Islamists from Benghazi, Libya's second city and the capital of Eastern Libya. Gen Haftar was well known in Libya, as a general who had fallen out with Gaddafi. In exile he had spent years plotting Gaddafi's downfall from a new base in Langley, Virginia - the American town that is also the headquarters of the CIA. Libya, in reality already in pieces, eventually found itself with two rival governments. Gen Haftar controlled the east from Benghazi, and set about unifying the country by marching west to attack Tripoli, the capital, aiming to unseat the internationally recognised Government of National Accord led by Fayez al Sarraj. Supporting Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj (l) Supporting Gen Khalifa Haftar (r) It was certain that foreign powers would get involved in the civil war. Libya is a desirable prize. It has the biggest reserves of oil and gas in Africa, with a population of less than seven million. Strategically, it is opposite Europe and its hydrocarbons can be exported direct to markets in the west through the Mediterranean. Rival producers in the Gulf need to ship their exports through potentially dangerous sea lanes. Gen Haftar's most important backers are Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. Turkey is the key ally of the Sarraj government in Tripoli. The US has sent a variety of signals out about Libya under President Donald Trump, offering encouragement at different times to Mr Sarraj and Gen Haftar, and bombing jihadist extremists when they can find them. Now their biggest concern is that Russia's President Putin might be establishing himself in Libya in the same way that he has dug into Syria. Libya's war has developed disturbing similarities with Syria's. The arbiters of the fate and future of both are the same foreigners. The proxy wars in Libya have become, in many ways, a continuation of the proxy wars in Syria. Both sides have flown in Syrian militias to apply the skills they have gained in almost a decade of war in their homeland. It is possible that Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan and Russia's President Vladimir Putin have applied in Libya a version of the deals they have made in Syria. The Russian mercenaries who have fought with Gen Haftar are from an organisation known as the Wagner Group, run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a close associate of President Putin. The Wagner fighters have also been used in Syria. It is significant that the Russian pullback from Tripoli has not been harassed by Turkey's highly efficient military drones. The Russians have also moved advanced warplanes into Libya. President Putin and President Erdogan could have agreed to end Gen Haftar's offensive against Tripoli so they can split the spoils between them, according to Wolfram Lacher, a German academic who has just published a book about the fragmentation of Libya. In the Chatham House webinar he said: \"We are talking about two foreign powers trying to carve up spheres of influence in Libya and their ambition may well be for this arrangement to be long term.\" He doubted whether the other powers involved in Libya, and the Libyans themselves, would quietly accept the arrangement. The next big battle could be for Tarhuna, a town that lies around 90km (55 miles) south-east of the capital. It is Gen Haftar's western stronghold, controlled by a militia known as al-Qaniyat, mainly made up of men previously loyal to the Gaddafi regime. Troops loyal to the Tripoli government, former opponents of Gaddafi, are advancing on Tarhuna. The fight against the old regime is still a factor in Libya's never-ending war.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody. Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC. Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of unrest, with widespread looting and buildings set alight. How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent? Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can \"become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community,\" says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University. Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds. Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police. This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise. Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say. \"Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,\" says Prof Stott. For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police. However, \"police often react towards the crowd as a whole\" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their \"us versus them\" mentality. This \"can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances.\" Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US \"ramped up their aggressiveness\" over the weekend. \"Deploying the National Guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation.\" It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent. Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational. Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism. Chief Wysocki on the march today, standing together with the residents we serve to remember and honor George Floyd. #StrongerTogether #CamdenStrong pic.twitter.com/UJAjxXkxrx End of Twitter post  by @CamdenCountyPD Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University. A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so \"when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected\". \"This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace\", because \"if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable.\" This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says. Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds. In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend. However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are \"irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part\". \"To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police.\" Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting \"often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies\", he says. Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. He says there is \"a long history of targeting, or selectivity\", in vandalism and looting. \"In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those.\" However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals. The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others. In Hong Kong, for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting. Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality. \"Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,\" says Dr Ho. \"It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message.\" Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key. \"Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,\" says Prof Stott. Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that \"one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them.\" More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation. Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution. Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated. \"You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,\" he says. \"The George Floyd case was not the cause - it's more like the straw that broke the camel's back. You could argue even the police killings are symptoms - the underlying cause is white supremacy, racism, and things the US has not fundamentally dealt with.\" President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world. This week we speak to Carly Fiorina, US business leader, political figure and philanthropist. It should give hope to any young person striving to reach the top, knowing that Carly Fiorina started her business career as a humble secretary. \"I spent my time greeting visitors, answering phones, typing memos,\" she says. \"But I was really committed to the job, arriving early, and leaving late.\" Mrs Fiorina, 65, is looking back on her 21-year-old self, who in 1976 got her first full-time job at a small property company in Palo Alto, California. From that modest start she went on to become the first female chief executive of a Fortune 50 company (the 50 largest firms in the US). This happened in 1999 when, aged 44, she was appointed to the top job at computer group Hewlett-Packard. Fortune magazine subsequently named her the most powerful woman in US business five years in a row, with the publication declaring that \"Carly Fiorina didn't just break the glass ceiling, she obliterated it\". However, her time at HP was not universally regarded as a success, with much criticism of her decision to merge the business with rival Compaq in 2001. And in 2005 she resigned after a disagreement with her fellow board members. Mrs Fiorina subsequently entered the political arena, first as an adviser to the late John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. McCain went on to lose the election to Barack Obama. Eight years later, she herself ran to become the Republican Party candidate for the 2016 presidential election. She dropped out after nine months, due to low polling numbers, with Donald Trump going on to win both the candidacy and, of course, the presidency. She said at the time that she was \"horrified\" by Trump. Born in 1954 in Austin, Texas, her family moved around a lot, due to her father's job. Her dad, Joseph Sneed, was a law professor who went on to become US deputy attorney general. Her mother was a painter. She got a degree in philosophy and medieval history from Stanford University in California, before gaining a Master of Business Administration from the University of Maryland. In 1980 she entered the technology sector when she joined US giant AT&T as a management trainee. Her rise at the company was meteoric. By 1990 she was the firm's first female vice president, and by 1995 she was a senior director at AT&T spinoff Lucent Technologies. It was also while at AT&T that she met her husband Frank, and they were married in 1985. Mrs Fiorina's success at the telecoms giant caught the attention of HP, who were looking for a fresh start after missing nine quarterly profit targets in a row. She was appointed to the top job at the company in July 1999. \"When I arrived at HP I purposely brought no-one new in at the beginning,\" she says. \"I did that for a very explicit reason, which was to send a very clear message to the organisation that we could, and we would, figure out what the problem was, and we would fix it. \"[However], I was brought in by the board to transform the company. Those were the words they used.\" Under Mrs Fiorina's leadership, costs were reduced, and eventually 30,000 jobs were removed from the combined 145,000 HP and Compaq workforce. A further 80,000 employees took pay cuts at a business which at its peak was worth $87bn (\u00a371bn). \"Of course it is incredibly difficult to have to fire people, to have to lay people off,\" she says. \"In that very difficult circumstance, the best I could do was to fully explain why. \"Why are we having to lay people off? Because if we don't, we will go out of business like many of our peers.\" When the merger between HP and Compaq went ahead in 2002, it was the biggest ever in the technology sector at the time, and created the world's largest seller of personal computers. Whether the merger was a success, however, is still hotly contested. Tech website ZDNet said in 2016 that HP and Compaq's coming together was \"the worst merger ever\". By contrast, the Huffington Post called it \"the merger that worked\". What is certain is that the HP board were unhappy with the profits and share price of the combined business, and Mrs Fiorina was asked to resign in 2005. Her severance package was reportedly worth $21m. \"We did, in fact, restore a great company,\" she says. \"[But] we had a dysfunctional board. It was dysfunctional when I arrived. It was dysfunctional when I left.\" If leading HP wasn't enough of a battle, Mrs Fiorina jumped into politics for a decade from 2006. After working for John McCain, she went on to stand as the Republican candidate in the 2010 US Senate election in California, but lost out to the Democratic Party incumbent. Mrs Fiorina then worked for the American Conservative Union, a right-wing lobbying organisation, before running to be the 2016 Republican presidential candidate. Looking back on this campaign, she says that \"the process itself is insane\". She adds: \"Meaning, when you think about the process the  candidates go through, does it really help someone to be a better leader? Does it help us to decide a better leader? I don't think so. \"It is a really crazy process that goes on for far too long.

She declines to comment.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window A group of performers were halfway across the Pacific Ocean in a 75ft sailing boat when the coronavirus pandemic erupted. Suddenly countries began closing their sea borders - leaving the vessel with no guarantee of a safe haven before the start of the typhoon season. When the crew of the Arka Kinari left Mexico on 21 February they, like everyone else, were aware of the coronavirus. They had no idea, though, how soon it would affect them and how seriously. They say they joked about it being just a Mexican beer. But approaching Hawaii six weeks later, they picked up a radio signal. As their boat sliced through the waves, they clustered on the foredeck around the tiny radio, intently listening to a crackled voice announcing that Pacific islands, such as the Cook, Christmas and Marshall Islands, were all closing their borders. \"This really brought it home to us that the whole world was really shutting down,\" says British crew member Sarah Louise Payne. They had set out from the Netherlands in August - two musicians with a multinational seven-person crew, including lighting and sound engineers, heading for Indonesia, the country they planned to make their base. Grey Filastine and his Indonesian partner Nova Ruth had spent years flying around the world performing at music festivals, playing their unique mix of traditional Javanese melodies and contemporary electronic music. Their lyrics focused on environmental and social justice, and Grey says he and Nova were \"frustrated about our complicity with the very same fossil capitalism that we're denouncing in our performances\". So they had an idea - to create a multimedia performance on board their boat with a message about the climate crisis and the health of the oceans. Finally, they would have \"a method that matches the message\", Grey says. The ship would have an engine for emergencies, but they would use it very sparingly. Essentially, it would be carbon-neutral travel. Grey believed it was important for musicians to demonstrate that this was viable: \"We can imagine life after the carbon economy and re-engage with the last great commons, the sea.\" They sold a share in a house in Seattle, and bought the boat. Nova originally wanted to build an Indonesian Pinisi sailing boat, but that would have required large amounts of tropical hardwood so they ended up recycling an old two-masted steel-hulled schooner. The sails double as screens during their performances. \"When we saw it, the two sails were similar to the Pinisi, so it was close to our dream,\" says Nova, whose mother's family are from the Bugis, a seafaring tribe. \"As a descendant of the Bugis I feel sad that I haven't learnt to sail, and very few of my generation do,\" she says. She was also motivated by the fact she has been told that women from the Bugis tribe shouldn't sail, \"so it's become my personal mission to do so\". For Sarah it was a perfect gig as she is a sailor and a lighting technician - alongside having \"a great love for this Earth of ours and the need to help protect it\". Fellow British crew member Claire Fauset joined the expedition after falling in love with \"the crazy plan and the beautiful boat and of course, the zombie apocalypse survival team that is this crew\". Grey and Nova borrowed money, around \u00a3250,000 (\u20ac300,000), so at some point the project needs to generate money, either through performances or taking on paying passengers. This has also been put in jeopardy by the coronavirus pandemic. \"Arka Kinari is a massive undertaking, it had already stretched us to the limits, physically, financially, emotionally, and then this happens,\" says Grey. After rebuilding the 1947 schooner in Rotterdam, crafting and rehearsing the on-board performances in Europe, the Canary Islands, Panama, and Mexico, they were mid-Pacific when the coronavirus outbreak became a pandemic affecting every country in the world. Grey and one other crew member, both US citizens, could have stayed indefinitely in Hawaii. The others - the Brits, a Spaniard and a Portuguese - got visas for a month, allowing them to restock with fresh food and regain their land legs. Nova had flown home from Mexico to prepare for the ship's arrival. During their time in Hawaii the rest of the crew monitored the spread of lockdown measures from one country to another. Soon enough, Indonesia announced a ban on all foreign arrivals by sea or air until further notice. \"I got the taste of ashes in my mouth. You could describe that as a personal meltdown,\" says Grey. Before setting off, they had made a Plan B for just about any eventuality - or so they thought. Their route had doubled in length to avoid piracy off Somalia and the war in Yemen, but the coronavirus was a complete broadside. \"In practical terms our plans would have been less disrupted by World War Three, because at least warring states don't close their borders to the ships of allies,\" says Grey. On 6 May, with the US visas about to expire, they decided to head for Indonesia anyway hoping that it might open its borders before the start of the typhoon season in June - but with no clear idea where they would go if it didn't. Before departure they were plagued with doubts and indecision. One crew member decided to bail out at the last minute. For the rest of the crew, with typhoon season bearing down on them, \"we had to put such apprehensive thoughts about borders closing aside,\" says Sarah. Now, three weeks later, fresh food is running low, but there is enough dry food to last a couple of months. Fresh water is not a problem thanks to solar-powered desalination equipment on the vessel. They are growing a few spindly lettuces on board as an experiment and catching fish with home-made lines and lures. This involved a change in diet for some of the crew. \"Veganism is a great choice on land, where plants grow - but we're on the sea, where the fish live,\" says Grey. They are now sailing at around 13 degrees latitude, and if they see any circular storm developing they will route south. Worryingly, the navigation system has broken so they are navigating by iPhone. \"While we do have some paper charts, an iPhone is now our most full-featured navigation tool. That might sound pathetic but it's far more information than the Polynesians or Captain Cook had to cross the Pacific,\" says Grey. If they could stop somewhere with internet, the problem with the main navigation chart plotter might be resolved, Grey says. They also need to anchor somewhere, even an uninhabited atoll, to fix some problems that developed in the rigging. But they don't know when or where they will next be able to land. \"And as we slowly sail towards Indonesia the worries about landing are eclipsing the worries of the sea,\" says Grey. At sea, everyone takes turns doing the necessary chores. During the dayshifts they steer the ship and carry out any sailing manoeuvres, enter data into the logbook, monitor the engine and grease the propeller shaft. The morning shift involves cleaning the solar panels, washing the dishes, swabbing the deck and inspecting the fresh food, while the afternoon is for big infrastructure projects, repairs, wood maintenance and carpentry, de-rusting and painting the steel hull. And then at night the only responsibility is to keep to the course and look out for hazards. The Arka Kinari doesn't stop. \"It's just you, the heavens above and infinite sea around,\" says Grey. \"On moonless nights your eyes become so light-sensitive that the rise of Venus and other planets casts a reflective path on the sea that we normally only experience from the Sun or Moon.\" Not only can you see the bow wave perfectly illuminated by starlight, he says, but the agitation of the water causes \"trails of bioluminescence, like underwater fireflies or grinder sparks\". \"If I bring the right music along, I can pass the whole two hours of my night watch breathless, in goosebumps.\" Back in Indonesia, Nova has been trying all her contacts to get permission for the Arka Kinari to land, but without success. Grey, as her spouse, might be allowed in, she gets told, but not the rest of the crew. Recently they passed Johnston Atoll, a US-administered territory once used for testing and storing chemical and biological weapons. They asked for permission to land, but there was no reply. \"Never thought I'd be asking a nuclear waste dump for refuge,\" says Grey. \"Given it has a three-mile security perimeter, we didn't dare get any closer.\" Next try was the Marshall Islands - completely closed. Along the route ahead are some islands evacuated after contamination by US nuclear tests in the 1950s, which would not be safe to live in permanently, but perhaps safe enough for a short visit. This could be the only place, Grey thinks, where they might be unnoticed or tolerated, and somewhere they could try waiting for a while. He points out that barring the boat is irrational, because they have been effectively quarantined at sea. \"Lawmakers didn't consider the fact that we spend weeks at sea in the strictest of quarantine. It's us that are at risk from land-dwellers, not the reverse.\" They are going slowly, intentionally, aiming to reach Indonesian waters in early July, hoping that by then they will be allowed to enter. If they can't, the Arka Kinari will need to seek refuge from the typhoons elsewhere, preferably a country not far away - if there is one that will have them - from which they can make a dash for Indonesia between typhoons, when borders open. On the project website they have announced all scheduled performances are suspended. When this crisis finally does come to an end, it states, the Arka Kinari will be ready to begin its role inspiring people through music to build a better future. Few Australians are aware that the country's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had regular contact with foreign Muslims long before the arrival of Christian colonisers. And Islam continues to exercise an appeal for some Aboriginal peoples today. When Islam came to Australia"

So, what sports can you play and who can you meet? The overall advice remains \"stay at home\" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. However, small-sided or full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, if social distancing guidelines are followed, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Moore than two people can now meet outside across the UK: In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. Children are included in the headcount for groups meeting in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales, two large families can meet - as long as each of them lives at a single address. And remember, social distancing guidelines - with people from different households remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - still apply across the whole of the UK. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible for many people who want to see their friends and family. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: \"It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet.\" Overnight stays are also still not permitted. Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, said: \"If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way.\" The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. The rules in Wales so far say you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not \"an invitation to go into a garden, have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people\". People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if you do go out, take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household. There is another group of about 2.5 million people, categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. These include people who have had organ transplants, cancer patients and those with severe respiratory conditions. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called \"shielding\". Now people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Despite the easing of lockdown restrictions across the UK, scientists stress the need for people from different households to remain 2m (6ft) apart. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. This coronavirus appears to thrive in crowded, indoor spaces which is why pubs, restaurants and many workplaces remain closed and the public has been advised against using public transport. But virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should stay at home and not leave it for any reason. This is known as self-isolation. You should not leave your property even to buy food or medicine, and instead order these online, or ask someone to drop them off at your home. If the NHS Test and Trace team in England gets in touch because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will have to self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but they must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children. Exact rules vary, but head teachers have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Head teachers have been told to keep focussing on priority pupils - vulnerable children and those of critical workers - across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Beyond these groups, nursery and pre-school children plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 will go back first in England. But not every primary school will reopen. A BBC Breakfast survey of 150 councils revealed many are not guaranteeing this. Of the 99 who responded, only 20 said they were advising schools to open more widely on 1 June: Another 15 said they would not be advising schools to open their doors to more pupils: Two-thirds (68) could not guarantee schools would reopen to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Plans include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could look different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is \"very, very small, but not zero\", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. But there is much uncertainty in the advice, and the group \"cannot be clear\" on the extent to which schools can reopen without increasing Covid-19 cases. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools will not be ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. But Schools Minister Nick Gibb told MPs there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in England back before the summer break. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It remains unclear how many families will take up the offer to go back. A study from the National Foundation for Educational Research, based on 1,200 school leaders, suggests: The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen to Year 10 and Year 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time. Students will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. As of 22 May, about 244,000 children were attending school in England - 2.6% of the total number of pupils. That figure included 75,000 \"vulnerable\" children - which the Department for Education estimates to be 15% of all young people in that category. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales and Scotland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England and Wales, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. Exam watchdogs have been working together on alternative arrangements.

So, what can customers expect and what is the timetable for the reopening of other types of outlets? Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. But now that list has grown in England. From Monday, open air markets and car showrooms have been allowed to reopen. The government says they must meet the Covid-19 secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. It says, as with garden centres (which reopened in England on 13 May), the risk of transmission of the virus \"is lower in these outdoor and more open spaces\". One car dealership is trusting customers to take test drives alone. The National Association of British Markets Authorities chief executive, David Preston, though expects a lot of older stallholders will not return because of virus fears. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland on Monday, prompting long queues. Hundreds of people starting queueing hours before the stores opened as Ikea asked them to come prepared with ready-made shopping lists and their own bags. From 15 June, non-essential stores in England will be able to reopen. This includes shops selling things like clothes, toys, books and electronics, as well as tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets. Among department stores, John Lewis will open 13 branches initially, while Next will only reopen 25 of its 500 stores on 15 June. Primark will keep its 190 shops closed until it is \"convinced that it is safe and right\" to open them. No dates have been set for the reopening of shops in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but each country has plans in place. Smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in Scotland in phase two of its lockdown easing plan. In Wales, non-essential shops and services could happen in the amber phase of its exit strategy. Non-food retail outlets can reopen in step two of Northern Ireland's plan. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone, if they can, and talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited and shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimates that the current lockdown is costing non-essential retailers \u00a31.8bn a week in lost sales, and it does not expect that to pick up immediately shops reopen. \"Evidence from other countries suggests that, despite an initial bounce in spending in the weeks after restrictions are lifted, discretionary spend is likely to remain subdued as the coronavirus pandemic wears on,\" said the BRC's Kyle Monk. The British Independent Retailers Association's chief executive, Andrew Goodacre, believes fewer people than before will go shopping and they may \"soon become weary of queuing\". He told the BBC: \"Social distancing also takes away the fun and positive experience of shopping. All these factors mean that it will be difficult at first, and for many months after.\" Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest, if they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection falls. Hospitality firms and some other small businesses may have to wait longer to reopen. And Mike Cherry, national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, wants the government to \"provide those firms some idea of when they'll be able to get back to work\". He added: \"High Streets up and down the country have been largely empty for months now, and while more businesses in England may be able to open up soon, there may well be not enough custom to justify the financial and health costs. \"Until people feel safe enough to spend, small businesses face a long struggle back to steady ground.\" President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone \"we're all going to wash our hands once an hour\". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says \"wash your hands\". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window As schools prepare to reopen on Monday to children in years one and six, some parents' social media feeds have turned toxic. Kirstie Brewer talks to mothers feeling judged or shamed for their decision to send children back to school - or to keep them at home. Marsha's WhatsApp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children on 1 June. There was outrage, relief, excitement, anxiety. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Marsha wrote that she'd be happy to send her son back to school. Then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher who'd tested positive for coronavirus. \"This is why I will be keeping Rosie safe at home with me - I'm not putting her life at risk,\" she wrote. A few other parents then sent thumbs-up and shocked-face emojis to show their approval of Rosie's mum's message. \"It felt very passive-aggressive,\" says Marsha, who said she didn't want her real name to be published because she couldn't face \"more drama\". The WhatsApp group she belongs to is for parents with a child in year one at a school in the Bristol area and is normally a source of useful information. But since the pandemic hit, it's become toxic, she says. \"People have been posting lots of screengrabs from Facebook which are full of misinformation about how the virus spreads and the risks to children,\" she says. \"But if you dare to try to correct anything or put things into perspective you get shot down and it is implied you are a bad parent. \"I'm trying to hold down a full-time job while also homeschooling two children - I find being judged by other parents on top of that very hard to deal with.\" Sophia, 25, had a similar experience when she commented on a Facebook group for single mums that her four-year-old daughter would be returning to preschool. She was branded \"selfish\" by another mum - and then she watched as that damning verdict was endorsed by \"likes\" from other members of the group. Normally this would be a very positive, empowering community says Sophia, who works full-time as a charity consultant, so it's a sign of how much times have changed. \"It showed me how much the lockdown is getting to people,\" she says. \"It feels as if the worst assumptions are being made about someone's reasons for sending their child back to school or nursery.\" Sophia's daughter has special educational needs and for weeks now she hasn't had access to her usual speech therapy. \"She learns a lot by being with other children so being at preschool is the next best thing for her,\" she explains. \"I could have a PhD in children's education and it would still be better for her to be around other children. There is no substitute for that.\" Parents who have decided to keep their children at home haven't escaped the crosshairs either. Harriet Shearsmith, founder of parenting website Toby & Roo, has an Instagram following of 116,000 and is one of the few \"mummy bloggers\" to have publicly stated her position on this divisive issue. She won't be sending her children back when the schools reopen in June, but when she explained this decision she was careful to add the caveat that she wasn't criticising other parents. \"If you fall into the group of people who are choosing differently to me or you simply don't have a choice, this isn't a judgement of you or a dismissal of your situation,\" she wrote. Some nonetheless responded witheringly that Harriet obviously didn't care much about her children's education - but as an experienced blogger she is accustomed to dealing with it. \"I've had comments, you know, 'You're going to be damaging your children,' or, 'You're just not very intelligent and a terrible mother.' That kind of thing is said, but I largely just ignore it,\" she says. \"Lockdown has made us all much quicker to lose our tempers. We are much more frayed and we are all in very stressful positions, regardless of what those positions might be.\" Fellow blogger Alison Perry says she has also noticed the ground shifting. \"It feels like all the social 'rules' have changed,\" she says. \"Everyone feels very differently about homeschooling and screen time and even just interpreting the government guidelines. I'm usually a very outspoken person but have found myself biting my tongue, because whatever I say, there will be someone there telling me I'm wrong or selfish.\" Liz, who lives near Cambridge, points to another possible explanation - people now have more time to spend on social media, she says, so any backlash gets amplified. Like Marsha and Sophia, she is planning on sending one of her children back to school on Monday. \"It's really difficult to know what the right decision is but we think that the benefits of our son going back to school outweigh the risk of him becoming ill,\" she says. She has been hurt by judgemental comments from other parents on her Facebook group, some of whom she's known for several years. \"Apparently those of us who are willing to send our children back to school when they reopen are sending them back to be 'guinea pigs' or 'canaries', to see if cases are going to rise again,\" she says. \"I said I found it offensive. That does imply that anyone who is happy to send their child back to school is throwing them to the wolves, so to speak, whereas actually we  just want some normality for our children, and, you know, education and socialisation.\" When she made this point in response to a critic on Facebook she says she was accused of \"bullying\". The issue seems to have caused a deep divide, she notes with regret. She has now minimised her time on social media and advises other parents in her position to do the same. The parents on Marsha's group who are sending their children to school have taken a different approach - they have started avoiding the main group chat and talking among themselves instead. A few parents on Mumsnet who've made the decision to send their child back to school say they've felt bruised by the negative responses of family or friends, which seem to be driven by worries about the infection risk. Many people are highly dubious that the youngest children can really be prevented from sharing bugs and carrying them out into the community, and lots of people have picked up on teachers' concerns about whether schools have had enough time to prepare a really safe environment. It seems likely that people's responses are driven by understandable fear and uncertainty, but if you're a parent run ragged by nine weeks of homeschooling while attempting to hold down a job, other people's judgement is likely to be the last thing you need. The first rule of self-care is to find time for yourself. But how do you do that when you have to juggle work and family duties? Easy, says Sue Elliott-Nicholls, just steal it.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The government has told schools to reopen for certain year groups from 1 June. But what does it mean in practical terms for schools - and how are they getting ready? We spoke to one head teacher to find out. \"It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are green.\" That is how Debbie Whiting, head teacher of North Denes Primary School in Norfolk, describes the task in front of her - remodelling her school during a pandemic so that three classes can return next month. \"The more you look at things, the more there is to think about,\" she says. Classrooms have been stripped out, new signage put up around the school and year groups divided into small \"bubbles\" to keep pupils away from each other and - it is hoped - minimise the risk of coronavirus spreading. The school in Great Yarmouth already knows it will not be ready to reopen for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes on 1 June, and is instead working to a deadline of 8 June. This summer the school should have been preparing to move into its new \u00a39m buildings, but construction delays mean all focus is now on making the existing school safe for returning pupils. \"The 1 June date might be convenient for being after half-term but it's not given us anything like the time we need to put things in place,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"It's really difficult. You just keep thinking, have we caught everything?\" Parents have been asked whether they will send their children back - but only half have responded, making planning difficult. So far, one-third of those who have replied say their children will return. Mrs Whiting estimates she can make her plans work if about 40% of the 180 children return. If they all came back, she would need an extra 12 classrooms at the school. The school hopes to make social distancing as natural as possible for children by breaking classes into smaller \"bubbles\" of about seven pupils and two teachers. But without knowing the intentions of the other families, the plans could be useless. Mrs Whiting has left the decision up to parents, but wrote to them recently to warn them \"school will be a very different place\". \"Until we have those numbers, planning to keep everyone safe in bubbles is really tricky,\" she said. \"My concern is that they've heard that schools are reopening and on 1 June they just arrive.\" For the rest of term, all school life will take place within the bubbles. In those groups pupils will learn, eat and play, with each bubble using a nominated classroom and set of toilets to prevent cross-infection. Children will not be allowed to take bags to school, and will work in a new exercise book and their teacher will not take them home to mark. Uniform policy will be scrapped as children will need to wear clean clothes every day \"and many will have outgrown it anyway\". \"If they've got different clothes on every day you'll know that they've actually changed,\" said Mrs Whiting. The school has gained experience from teaching the children of key workers over the past weeks, and the numbers have steadily risen from eight pupils to 20. \"Parents will expect us to social-distance their children, and we intend to do that,\" says Mrs Whiting. The school day will be re-organised, with staggered starts and a lunchtime finish once children have been given their food. In the morning, children in each bubble will arrive at 15-minute intervals, and line up in the playground two metres (6ft 6ins) apart before being led into their classrooms. Only one parent will be allowed to drop off and collect each child, with no gathering by the school gates, though Mrs Whiting acknowledges getting several children to school at different times is \"likely to cause problems\" in single-parent households. Bubbles will be kept separate at break times and when they are given lunch, with each being given their own area of the playground to use. Even before coronavirus, the school was without its kitchen because of building works, and could only use half of its main hall. Pupils' movements around the school will be restricted mainly to their bubbles, but the way they use the communal areas will change. Each year will have a separate entrance to the buildings, and school corridors will operate a one-way system so people can maintain their distance. Doors will be left propped open and handles cleaned regularly. \"It's about controlling all movement,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"We also started careful hand washing before the lockdown and the children have been pretty good at that.\" Hand dryers in the toilets have been switched off on official advice, and replaced with paper towels, while the school has ordered pedal bins for every classroom so that PPE - which will be used for first aid or personal care - can be disposed of safely and without contact. Classrooms will also look different, with the need for distancing reducing capacity to about eight desks. All rooms have now been decluttered and non-essential items removed, filling the school's storage spaces. In the younger age groups' classrooms, soft furnishings, rugs and toys have been removed - anything remaining will have to be washed at the end of each day. Cleaning routines have been stepped up and surfaces will be disinfected regularly. Pupils will be asked to bring their own stationery, and forbidden from sharing. In a letter to parents, Mrs Whiting had previously warned \"there is no such thing as social distancing in a school - we can try but we certainly cannot guarantee it\". The logistics of preparing the school come on top of the everyday challenges of leading a school in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country. \"The government line is to get children in school so that they don't fall behind, and in disadvantaged areas that is important,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"But a lot of those who want to return are not those who are in that group.\" The Department for Education says it wants children back in schools \"for their education and wellbeing\", and the phased return is based on scientific and medical advice. For head teachers, the last few weeks have been \"wearing\", says Mrs Whiting, as they juggle pressures from government, parents who want their children to be kept at home, and those who want them back at school. Underpinning all the preparations, her focus has been on keeping the children as safe as possible. \"This is something I've never ever had to deal with,\" she said. \"And you do wonder what happens if someone gets it and, heaven forbid, there's a fatality? \"But I can't hold myself responsible for that, because I'm not the one who is asking them to come back.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Some children in England will be going back to school from Monday 1 June. Following a heated debate, the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus. Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus. Across the UK, 0.01% of deaths were people under 15, 1% were aged 15-44 and about 75% were over 75. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 as at 15 May, and half were younger, according to a research charity. But the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40. Children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases, according to Prof Adilia Warris, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Exeter. They often have \"milder disease than adults,\" she says, pointing out that deaths have been rare. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads. It is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is - at any age. To understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population, and work out how they might have caught it. A University College London review of the evidence, based on studies using contact tracing and population screening, suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the \"balance of evidence\" suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and, if they do catch it, less likely to pass it on. But the \"evidence remains inconclusive,\" it said. One study looking at cases in Shenzhen in China at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus, raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms. But research carried out since then has been more reassuring. Studies of clusters of infections in family groups across China have concluded - based on contact tracing - that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children. A study of a cluster of infections in the French Alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms. Community studies in Iceland, South Korea, the Netherlands and  Italy all found evidence children were less likely to have - or have had - the virus than adults. The Italian region studied tested 70% of its population. A review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded: \"The role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households.\" One theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells. But experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this. More children in schools means more teachers working, and more parents at the school gates, and it's not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection. As the Sage report says, \"It is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff, parents, and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school.\" The group of scientists modelled nine different \"return to school\" scenarios. On 16 May, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the R number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading - while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school. It was reported that in 22 European Union countries where schools were partially reopened, there hadn't been a significant increase in cases, including among staff. These countries all opened up schools to different extents. France did report a small uptick in cases after partially re-opening schools. But World Health Organization (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan agrees that children are \"less capable\" of spreading the virus, and are at \"very low risk\" of getting ill from the disease. \"What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.\" Government guidelines say it wants to start with Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children in England because: The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen to Year 10 and Year 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time The schools minister Nick Gibbs told MPs there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in England back before the summer break.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Around 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home. This \"shielding\" is to protect lives. While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves. The guidance on shielding is being kept under review as the UK moves out of lockdown. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from Monday 1 June, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. Other parts of the UK have not yet recommended the same. Those most at risk, who include: While it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, over half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. Over 90,000 are children. Anyone in this highest risk category who has not yet received a letter from the NHS or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online. This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing. Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations. You could call your doctor to discuss this. It means staying at home and following the guidelines. You should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors. Visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water. They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you. They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing. They should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window. If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels. If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too. Keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails. Communities Minister Robert Jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs. The Treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is \"more tailored to individuals' needs\". In England, people have been asked to shield until the end of June and this date will be reviewed. In Wales, it's 15 and in Northern Ireland and Scotland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to. The ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. A vaccine could help towards this. These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading: Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible. Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online. Prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas. You can register for support with food, shopping and deliveries and additional care. Over two million food boxes have been delivered in England since the programme started.

Have they been met? \"We will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day\" - Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 18 March Outcome: On the same day a press release from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) gave more details of the tests to diagnose coronavirus and said \"the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks\". But the government did not hit 25,000 tests a day by mid-April. Only 18,665 tests were conducted in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) on 15 April. In terms of testing capacity - the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day - that stood at more than 30,000 by mid-April. \"I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month\" - Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 2 April Outcome: On 1 May, the government said it had reached the target and announced 122,347 tests for the last day of the month (30 April). The testing figure had been averaging about 20,000 a day but increased significantly in the last days of April. When home testing kits were introduced in large numbers towards the end of the month, DHSC began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesn't mean the test was actually used by someone on that day. Previously, only instances in which the testing swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. The 122,347 figure included about 40,000 kits sent out to homes and test centres. Prof John Newton, who leads the government's testing programme, said: \"That's the way they are counted, have always been counted, and the way we were advised to count them by officials.\" In May, the government hit its target 18 times and missed it 13 times. The devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing. But Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5,000 tests a day by mid-April, blaming problems obtaining testing kits. Likewise, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 April that Scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10,000 tests per day by the end of April, saying \"we are working towards a capacity of 3,500 by the end of April\". The Scottish Government announced at the beginning of May that it had reached this reduced target. \"The ambition, clearly, is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month, and then to go even higher\" - Boris Johnson in Parliament 6 May There had been some confusion as to whether the target for testing by the end of May was 200,000 tests conducted or a capacity to do this many tests. Matt Hancock eventually clarified that it would be the capacity for tests, and that it would include antibody tests (which establish whether somebody previously had the virus) and tests being sent out to a random cross-section of society by statisticians, as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms. On 30 May, the DHSC announced that the UK had hit the target, with labs able to process 205,634 tests a day. This included capacity to do 40,000 antibody tests a day. However, as of 30 May, no antibody tests had actually been processed. When it comes to number of people actually tested for coronavirus on a daily basis, the government has not released this figure since 22 May. The DHSC says the number has been \"temporarily paused.\" \"We are working with Boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of April\" - Matt Hancock statement, 4 April Outcome: DHSC told the BBC on 4 May that 49 regional test centres were operational across the country. Mr Hancock had previously said in a statement that there would be \"over 50\" by the end of April. The \"drive-through\" test centres are run by Boots and other commercial providers. DHSC also said that 96 mobile testing sites were in service by 4 May. \"By mid May, we'll have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place\" - Matt Hancock, 1 May Outcome: On 1 May, Mr Hancock said that the government's testing programme was the \"first element\" in the wider strategy to \"test, track and trace\". He added that an \"initial 18,000\" contact tracing staff would be in place \"by mid-May\". Their role is to identify individuals that have Covid-19 and then to \"track and trace\" anyone they've recently been in contact with. Those individuals can then get themselves tested. On 18 May, Mr Hancock told Parliament that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited in England, of whom 7,500 were healthcare professionals. And on 20 May, Mr Johnson told Parliament, \"already we have recruited 24,000 trackers - by 1 June we will have 25,000.\" \"I have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will help us very greatly to defeat this disease.\" On 1 June, Matt Hancock said that the contact tracers had been working since Thursday 28 May, but would not give figures for how many people they had contacted. \"On the personal protective equipment, the answer is by the end of this week.\" - Boris Johnson, 25 March Outcome: On 25 March, Mr Johnson was asked in parliament when \"every single person\" working in care homes around the country would receive the personal protective equipment (PPE) they needed. He said it would happen by the end of that week. However, that didn't appear to happen. In early April, Nadra Ahmed, from the National Care Association, said, \"The issue we hear most is, 'I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.' Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\" According to those working in the care home sector, the situation improved later in April but was not resolved. Martin Green from Care England said on 20 April that \"access to PPE remains problematic\" and that care homes still need \"a consistent supply\". The DHSC says that from 25 February to 10 May, 1.22 billion items of PPE have been delivered across the health and social care system in England (it hasn't given a figure just for care homes though). This figure includes: It has also confirmed that, for this figure, gloves are counted individually (it would be around 355m if counted as pairs). Concerns about the availability of PPE in care homes have also been raised in Scotland and Wales. \"Making sure that the NHS always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical\" - Matt Hancock, 17 April Outcome: The government has met its objective. By 18 May, the last day the figures were published, the proportion of critical care beds occupied by Covid-19 patients had fallen to 20% in England, 17% in Wales, 10% in Scotland and 15% in Northern Ireland. The spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for the virus. The government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment. \"Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks\" - Matt Hancock, 5 April Outcome: The DHSC told the BBC that, by 5 May, the government had managed to make 10,900 mechanical ventilators available to the NHS across the UK. Mr Hancock's 18,000 target was for this type of ventilator, according to the DHSC. The original UK target had been higher but was reduced, Mr Hancock said, because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for the DHSC said: \"Every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one. We continue to keep capacity ahead of demand.\" This article was updated to reflect the latest figures on testing and contact tracers. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated \u00a310bn to the economy. But ceremonies this year have been devastated by the coronavirus outbreak. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights - and are you entitled to a refund? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to start taking place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland currently allows weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have also applied for emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment\", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act\", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to \u00a330,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust. President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Testing will be an essential part of the government's contact-tracing system for controlling the epidemic as lockdown eases. People with symptoms will need to access a test quickly so that, if they are found to have coronavirus, anyone they have been in contact with can be tracked down and told to self-isolate. Anyone with symptoms in the UK can now be tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. If you think you need a coronavirus test you can arrange to visit a regional test site. Alternatively, you can ask for a home test kit. The tests we're talking about are to find out if you currently have the virus. They are performed by a taking a swab up the nose or from the back of the throat. The government is buying another type of test. Antibody tests use a blood sample to find out if you've had the virus in the past. It will first be made available to health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. A number of targets have been set on testing, with the most recent one on capacity. The government said it wanted UK labs to be able to process 200,000 tests a day by the end of May, and said it reached this on 30 May when capacity hit 205,634. This includes the ability to do 40,000 antibody tests a day. But capacity does not mean that that many tests are being carried out - only that they could be if enough people were reached or needed one. Previously, the government set a target that 100,000 coronavirus tests would be carried out per day across the UK by the end of April, and managed to log 122,347 tests on 30 April. But it was criticised for including in this figure about 40,000 testing kits which had been sent out but not yet completed or processed. The number of tests performed is not the same as the number of people tested - on 22 May there were 140,497 tests but 80,297 people tested. The reasons for the gap include: Also counted in the tests, but not the people tested, are figures used by the Office for National Statistics to estimate the level of infection within the population as a whole. While this is important, it's not about diagnosing individuals. Concerns have been raised about long waits for some test results. While there will now be fewer people with symptoms in the general population, as the epidemic recedes, it's been suggested that the 800,000 people who work for the NHS should be tested about once a week. Some have suggested health and care staff should be tested, possible twice a week, since the test is most effective around the first three days of having symptoms. Speed is also of the essence when it comes to the \"test and trace\" system. People with symptoms need a quick test so the people they have been in contact with can be tracked down and told to isolate. Delays will give more time for the virus to spread. Anyone with symptoms should immediately isolate, but until they have a positive test, others they already infected who might be asymptomatic might continue spreading the infection. On 27 May the prime minister committed to an aim of returning all coronavirus tests within 24 hours of the swab being taken. Later that day the head of the Test and Trace programme, Dido Harding, said 84% of tests at drive-in centres were returned within 24 hours, and 95% within 48 hours. She didn't provide a figure for home testing kits or those provided at other settings. The Department of Health and Social Care said no formal deadline had been set to achieve this. A \"test and trace\" system is being launched in England on 28 May meaning anyone with a positive coronavirus test will  be contacted to report their recent encounters with people, and places they have visited. Those who have been in \"close contact\" with someone who tests positive will have to isolate for 14 days, even if they have no symptoms. A close contact will include household members and anyone who has been within 2 metres of someone for more than 15 minutes. A similar scheme is launching in Scotland called Test and Protect. Tests can also help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work, let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing and lockdowns. For this reason, an initial 20,000 households in England will be tested every month for a year - for active coronavirus infections and for antibodies indicating a past infection. The UK significantly increased its testing capacity throughout April, but lagged behind many other nations. Germany, for example, was regularly averaging 100,000 tests a day by the start of April. The UK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. But it also took several weeks to expand from an initial eight public health laboratories to a wider network of private and university labs. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested?

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window People who've been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 in England and Scotland are now being traced by thousands of health workers. BBC News answers some of your questions on how the schemes will work. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can\u2019t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth \u00a395.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. No.The Department of Health says the service will begin tracking those who tested positive in England on Wednesday and going forward. Anyone who tested positive before that should already be self-isolating for at least seven days, with other members of their household self-isolating for 14 days While most NHS contact tracers won\u2019t be trained health professionals, there is also a clinical team of local public health experts which will deal with more complex cases. The Department of Health says if someone who works in a care home tests positive, it will be escalated to this team and it will work with the care home to agree the best course of action. It will consider things like whether personal protective equipment was worn and whether staff had been able to remain at a distance from each other. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage. Yes, people who have previously tested positive will be asked to self-isolate again. That's because there are still a number of uncertainties about whether having coronavirus gives you immunity, or whether people with immunity can transmit the illness to others. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who tested positive for the virus in March, told LBC Radio that he would have to isolate if he was approached by a contact tracer. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford\u2019s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland's chief dental officer has expressed hope that routine dental care will be available by the end of July. In Wales, the aim is to gradually reintroduce routine dental care before January 2021, and Northern Irish dentists are to discuss a schedule for reopening at a meeting on 2 June. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. All personal protective equipment (PPE) worn during the highest-risk situations - such as aprons, gloves and surgical masks - should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. However, guidelines now say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed in these \"exceptional circumstances\". But doctors and nurses are not happy with this situation. The Royal College of Nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if adequate PPE has not been provided. If you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. \"If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,\" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. \"Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.\" It\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK\u2019s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will \"remain unprecedented\" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to \"long waiters\", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre-Covid-19 levels\u201d. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that \"infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Primary schools in England are starting to reopen from 1 June, depending on the number - pupils in Reception and Years 1 and 6 are among the first to return. It's expected that about half of the children entitled to return will do so. At present, it is not compulsory for parents to send their children to school, and there will be no fines for non-attendance. However, the government says that eligible children are \"strongly encouraged\" to attend. It is expected that this temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - will continue for all parents of any year groups going back in England during the summer term. There are currently no plans for schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland to reopen before the end of the summer term. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are \"no restrictions\" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: \"Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes.\" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may \"vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe\", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. The number of flights arriving in the UK has dropped dramatically during lockdown. The UK government has said it will introduce a two-week quarantine period for international passengers from 8 June. If travellers cannot say where they plan to self-isolate, then they will do so in accommodation arranged by the government. There are some exemptions, including people arriving from the Republic of Ireland. Airlines and airport operators have said that maintaining social distancing is very difficult, and many are advising passengers to wear face coverings and gloves. Healthrow is trialling large-scale temperature checks for some passengers. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. There is no specific guidance on this, according to employment lawyer Susie Al-Qassab, but as long as you are not unwell, and your role permits it, your employer should allow you to work from home on full pay. If you cannot do your job from home, then the unpaid leave may be seen as a suspension and may not be allowed. You should check your contract to see what your employer is entitled to do. If they are acting beyond their rights, they will need to seek to reach an agreement with you not to attend work for a specific period (which would usually need to be treated as paid leave) Statutory sick pay (SSP) is currently payable to all those who are self-isolating. You should query whether this is available to those who are self-isolating because they have returned to the UK from abroad. If you\u2019re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of \u00a37,500. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months (\u00a36,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job \"absolutely cannot be done from home\". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. In the case of small and medium-sized employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days. Eligible employees are entitled to \u00a395.85 a week. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it\u2019s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: \"We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,\" he said. \"So we are talking about really large numbers of people.\" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who\u2019s leading the Church\u2019s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Lockdown measures are starting to be eased after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? From Monday in England, you will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households outside - either in parks or now also in private gardens - as long as you remain 2m (6ft) apart. From Friday in Scotland, members of two different households will be allowed to meet up outdoors if you maintain social distancing. Groups cannot be bigger than eight, and people are \"strongly recommended\" not to meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, the BBC understands that people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland, although outdoor weddings with 10 people present may be allowed from 8 June. There is no longer any limit to the amount of time you can spend outside doing exercise, or in \"open-air recreation\" like sunbathing in England and, from Friday, in Scotland. Currently, you can play outdoor sports such as golf or tennis with members of your household or with one other person from another household (while maintaining social distance). From Monday, people in England will also be able to exercise outside with up to five others from different households. That means small groups of sport teams can resume fitness sessions, but social distancing must be maintained. In Scotland, outdoor activities where physical distancing can be maintained can resume from Friday. This includes golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, where the rules are different. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. However, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced the lifting of some lockdown measures in the country from 29 May. As well as meeting people from one other household outside, people will also be able to sit or sunbathe in parks and open areas. It will also be possible to travel - preferably by walking or cycling - for recreation, although people will be asked to remain \"where possible\" within or close to their own local area. Rules in Wales are set to be relaxed next week, while any changes in Northern Ireland will be confirmed after the executive meets next Thursday. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so \"for the foreseeable future\". But the government says those who can't, should travel to their workplace if it is open - and walk, cycle or drive if at all possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport. Those who do use buses or trains are being told to expect social-distance queuing and to wear face coverings. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from Monday 1 June, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. These people all have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. Other parts of the UK have not yet recommended the same. House moves and viewings can resume again in England. Potential buyers and renters will be able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England have now been told they can return to work - but only if they're caring for youngsters who come from the same household. During lockdown, registered childminders have either been closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers. The government has said it would like pre-school nurseries in England to start reopening from 1 June. The government's ambition is for all primary school children in England to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible. In England, pupils in nurseries, early years and Reception and Years 1 and 6 at primary schools will be able to return from 1 June. Class sizes are expected to be no more than 15 pupils, with staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. From 15 June, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their \"continued remote, home learning\". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. The university watchdog says new students must be told with \"absolute clarity\" how they will be taught before accepting a place. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 June, if they are \"Covid-secure\". But the government has said these dates could change if coronavirus infection rates increase. Garden centres have already reopened in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are now due to reopen in Scotland. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will open from 4 July at the earliest, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection goes down. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and the government has now said a two-week quarantine period for people arriving in the UK will be introduced \"as soon as possible\". There will be some exemptions for people arriving from the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area. If international travellers cannot say where they plan to self-isolate for 14 days, they will have to do so in accommodation arranged by the government. All passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months, with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year. Some airlines have grounded their entire fleets, while others have been focusing on cargo flights, in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can. Now, however, many carriers are making plans to get back in the air. Ryanair, for example, says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from July, EasyJet plans to resume some flights in mid-June, while Air France KLM and Lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of June. Hungarian carrier Wizz Air has already resumed flights. In the UK, the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 June - which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country. But can passengers fly safely, or will they be at risk of infection? The Covid-19 coronavirus is still relatively new, so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply. But previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections. A 2018 study by researchers from Emory University in Atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft, and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases. \"A droplet-mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger. Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger,\" the researchers concluded. But contrary to this, earlier research - led by the same academics - had shown that in real life cases passengers with Sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area. Their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport, while embarking or disembarking from the plane, or from touching contaminated surfaces, rather than by breathing in infected droplets. The simulations also indicated that, because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers, they could generate several new infections, and concluded \"it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill\". Meanwhile, public health officials in Canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from Guangzhou to Toronto were found to have Covid-19. The flight had 350 people on board, and lasted for 15 hours. Although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections, the chief engineer at aerospace giant Airbus insists that is not the case. Jean-Brice Dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean. \"Every two to three minutes, mathematically, all the air is renewed,\" he says. \"That means 20 to 30 times per hour, the air around you is completely renewed.\" Put simply, air is collected from outside the aircraft, normally through the engine, and mixed with recycled air from the cabin. The recycled air, which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels, is passed through HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters that are similar to those used in hospitals. The Covid-19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter (a nanometre is a billionth of a metre) and is within the particle-size range that HEPA filters capture - 10 nanometres and above. Mr Dumont says: \"HEPA filters have standards, and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards. They filter out 99.97% of particulates (small particles) of the size of Covid-19.\" The flow of the air itself, he explains, is also designed to minimise infection risks. \"The air flows vertically. It is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet. That makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited. So a passenger from row one, for example, cannot contaminate someone in row 20.\" But is this enough? This regular flow of air, from top to bottom, can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles, thus altering the path of any airborne particles. And crucially, while HEPA filters do work, they can't capture all Covid-19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in, says Dr Julian Tang, consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and associate professor at Leicester University. He is also one of the team behind a study, published this month, looking at minimising the airborne transmission of Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. \"Filtration only works on mass airflows, most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short-range face-to-face conversations. Close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane, train or a bus - this is the biggest risk.\" And even if you are further away, the risk is not eliminated, says Dr Tang. \"How long Covid-19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors. It varies between different people, it varies depending on the state of your infection, and you can't say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres. \"Some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres - and they all could be carrying the virus.\" Dr Tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as Covid-19 or Mers, Sars and influenza, something which they argue has been overlooked. But Mr Dumont believes that simple precautions, such as wearing masks, and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks. \"I want to be precise on that. We want people to wear masks,\" he says. This, he claims, combined with the rapid replacement of air, should minimise exposure. So, would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft, for example by blocking out middle seats - a move contemplated by some airlines, but described by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary as \"idiotic\"? \"We don't think so,\" says Mr Dumont. \"It doesn't add to the risk reduction, we believe.\" Virologist Dr Tang disagrees: \"The problem is that if you're sitting next to somebody - 0.6 metres in economy, say - who's coughing and sneezing in that immediate area, that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system, get filtered and come back down again.\" Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents airlines, has set out a detailed \"biosecurity roadmap\", which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry. Much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself, but on the time spent in the airport - where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another. It wants that time to be minimised as much as possible. As a result, it is calling for: The actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk - and according to Iata vice president Nick Careem, \"physical distancing on board is not necessary\". The emphasis, he says, should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin, as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas. That could include banning queues for the washrooms. The key message, Mr Careem says is that \"there is no silver bullet, no single measure that can prevent infection\". Dr Tang, meanwhile, says he would fly with precautions. \"If I get on a plane, I'll be wearing a mask. It's not 100% but at least I'll have some protection.\" President Trump says violent protests in the US over George Floyd's death are \"acts of domestic terror\".

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Bosses who have furloughed staff during the coronavirus crisis will have to start paying a share of the government scheme from August. The furlough scheme is designed to help people put on leave due to the coronavirus outbreak, and to prevent employers having to make mass redundancies. So how does it work and who is eligible? The government is currently paying the wages of more than a quarter of UK jobs through its furlough programme - the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It puts workers on leave and allows them to stay on the payroll. About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed since March, with the government paying 80% of their salaries up to \u00a32,500 a month. Companies can top up this pay if they choose and must let employees know they have been furloughed. The scheme - backdated to 1 March - opened to applications on 20 April. By the end of May \u00a315bn of claims had been made. It will run until the end of October and is expected to end up costing about \u00a380bn. On 29 May, Mr Sunak announced two changes. From 1 July, businesses can bring furloughed employees back to workplaces part-time, a month earlier than previously announced. It will be down to individual firms to decide what part-time means and pay the wages for that time. They will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work. For example, Mr Sunak said an employer could bring someone back to work two days a week. In that situation, the employer would pay for those days, while the furlough scheme would cover the employee for the other three working days. From 1 August, employers will have to pay national insurance and pension contributions. Furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay. In September, employers will then pay 10% of employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at \u00a32,500 per employee per month before tax, or \u00a3576.92 a week. If employees are not paid set amounts each month - for example if they have returned from maternity leave, or receive top-up pay - you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built in to an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. All the money claimed must be paid to your workers, or to cover their national insurance and pension payments, even if a firm is in administration. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank account, if you are eligible. Claims take about six working days to process. Potentially yes, if your company can't give you work to do because of the coronavirus outbreak. The scheme covers those who were on an employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. This includes full-time and part-time workers, and employees on flexible, zero-hour or agency contracts. You must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and you can be furloughed more than once. If you have been made redundant since 19 March, your former employer can re-hire you under the scheme. But newly hired employees are not eligible. Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than \u00a350,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500. Anyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding for health reasons or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage. If you are placed on furlough you can't do any work for your employer. This will change from July onwards when the government says furloughed workers can return on a part-time basis. You can volunteer in the community or even for your company as long as you aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. From July to October, you may be able to work part time, and be furloughed for the remainder of your hours. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to \u00a32,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. Companies don't have to keep on any employees when furlough ends, and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages. The hope is that by the time the scheme ends, restrictions will have lifted and businesses can start paying full salaries again.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window The self-employed are receiving government support to cover some of the losses they face as businesses struggle in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Ultimately, it may not be as generous as the scheme for furloughed workers, but it will now extend into the summer, following the latest announcement from Chancellor Rishi Sunak. If they have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant is being paid to the self-employed or partnerships, worth 80% of their profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month. It is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year but who confirm business has been hit by coronavirus. Initially, this was for three months in one lump-sum payment. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment, the chancellor has said, which will cover 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months, so \u00a36,570 in total. This will again be made as a lump sum direct into bank accounts. More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The scheme has been open to those with a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Those who are recently self-employed, having set up since April 2019, will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because they will not have filed a tax return and therefore HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will not know of their self-employed status. Self-employed people can apply for the first grant until 13 July, and the second from August - at a date to be set. They do not need to have received the first to apply for the second. The government's help comes on top of a six-month delay for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Those with the lowest incomes are in line to receive more generous benefits payments, announced previously. The chancellor said those applying for universal credit should be paid within a few days. The chancellor said this will cover 95% of the self-employed who make most of their money from self-employment. This is how it works: Those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will have 80% of their salary covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if operating through PAYE. There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of \u00a3781 a month. The number has risen fast since the financial crash of a decade ago. About 3.8 million of them may be covered by this scheme. So far, 2.3 million self-employed have signed up to grants totalling \u00a36.8bn. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education. The chancellor also suggested tax breaks for the self-employed, such as lower national insurance may end in the future. These were in place because, for example, the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay, and to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of the self-employed with employees. A plan had already been announced for those who are employed. The government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). These was backdated to March and the scheme has been extended to October. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment. Employers will have to make a contribution to these payments from the summer. The self-employment support package is slightly less generous, but the Treasury says this is because, unlike salaried worker, self-employed people are still free to operate if work is available.

All routine dental care in England has been suspended since 25 March. The British Dental Association (BDA) has welcomed the announcement but says key questions remain. Currently, any patient with an emergency dental problem is supposed to be referred to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub for treatment. In a letter to all practices, NHS England's chief dental officer, Sara Hurley, said: \"We are asking that all dental practices commence opening from Monday, 8 June for all face-to-face care, where practices assess that they have the necessary IPC and PPE requirements in place.\" The BDA said that while dentists would be relieved by the announcement, the ability of practices to reopen would depend on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). \"It is right to allow practices to decide themselves when they are ready to open. Dentists will be keen to start providing care as soon as is safely possible, but we will need everyone to be patient as practices get up and running,\" said BDA chairman Mick Armstrong. \"Dentists can open their doors but won't be able to provide a full range of care without the necessary kit. Longer term, practices can only stay afloat with ongoing support, while social distancing continues and the costs of providing care are sky high.\" Official data shows there were 12,010 dental practices in the UK in 2017. According to NHS England, almost half of all adults were seen by an NHS dentist in the 24 months up to 31 December 2019. Some practices say it is going to be a challenge to reopen on 8 June. \"We've got a few issues,\" says Sophia Joseph, an NHS dentist practice manager in Sheffield. \"One of the biggest issues is PPE. We were asked to donate our PPE to other causes, like hospitals and care homes. \"Now we're being told to get that PPE back. I'm not sure if we will reopen, as it will be extremely difficult to get the PPE and maintain it,\" she says. At the moment any patient with an emergency dental problem is supposed to be referred to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. More than 550 of these centres have been created to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. However, the BDA has previously warned about problems with the UDC hubs, including PPE shortages, which has left many patients going untreated. Going to the dentist is likely to be a very different experience once practices reopen. Ms Hurley has written to dentists about the sort of measures practices will need to consider before reopening, including: Some dentists are already putting in place new measures. \"We will arrange regular deep-cleanings of the entire surgery, and probably be including UV-light cleaners as well,\" says Alexandra Germain, a dentist based in Marylebone, London. She also says that hand sanitiser, masks and gloves will be mandatory for patients in the waiting area. If symptoms are serious, local dentists can prescribe medication, such as painkillers and antibiotics, over the phone. In such cases, dentists can contact local pharmacies, which can then prepare medication for patients to pick up. If a patient has an urgent dental problem, they should be referred to a UDC hub by their dentist. Other emergency treatment may also be available. For example, some hospitals may offer emergency dental appointments. However, if a patient cannot reach their local dentist then the advice is to use the 111 online service.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window Durham Police have investigated Dominic Cummings' relocation of his family to Durham during lockdown. They found that when he subsequently drove to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight \"there might have been a minor breach\"  of the law. Mr Cummings has maintained he behaved reasonably and legally throughout the episode. Mr Cummings drove his family to Durham to stay at his father's farm on the evening of 27 March, after his wife fell ill and suspecting that he might soon fall ill. The next day he developed coronavirus symptoms and was self-isolating. By 12 April Mr Cummings was cleared to return to work and wanted to travel back to London. He decided to go for a drive first to see whether he could drive safely. \"My wife was very worried particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.\" He explained that after parking on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town, he felt sick and the family walked \"about 10-15m\" and sat by the riverbank for about 15 minutes. Durham Police have now investigated and said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to or from the town he would have been told to return to his father's property. If he had agreed no further action would have been taken. The police view is that it might have been a minor breach of the regulations because Mr Cummings maintained social distancing - ie stayed more than 2m away from anyone. According to Adam King, a senior criminal barrister at QEB Hollis Whiteman, \"the use of the word 'might' makes clear that it's not the police's ultimate decision whether to determine reasonable excuse, that's for the courts.\" \"However, if the police's view was that it was a reasonable excuse you would expect them to say that, as they do in relation to the drive to Durham,\" he says. Many people have questioned whether it was dangerous to test his ability to drive with his wife and child in the car and said it was a breach of the Highway Code and motoring laws. Others have pointed out that it took place on his wife's birthday. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove earlier defended the trip by saying it was \"consistent with the guidelines\". He also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. \"It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well,\" Mr Gove said. But the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - says \"driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise\" was not likely to be reasonable. When Mr Cummings originally took his family to Durham to stay at a cottage on the family farm, the police view was that the law wasn't broken. \"Durham Constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father's premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020.\" The lockdown has been underpinned by both the law and various sets of government guidelines. The police only deal with the law. That says: \"During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.\" The law gives examples of reasonable excuses such as obtaining necessities, exercise, medical need and travelling to work. But the list is not exhaustive which means there can be reasonable excuses that are not on it. There are lockdown \"rules\" that are in the guidelines but not in the law. When Mr Cummings drove his family to Durham he suspected his wife had coronavirus and the whole family should have been remaining in their home and self-isolating, according to the guidelines. But he said he feared both him and his wife becoming incapacitated and unable to look after their four-year-old. He has cited a section in the advice that says: \"We are aware that not all these measures will be possible if you are living with children, but keep following this guidance to the best of your ability.\" On 2 April, Mr Cummings' son was taken to hospital in an ambulance after he \"threw up and had a bad fever\". The next day his son \"had recovered and seemed back to normal\" and Mr Cummings said he drove to the hospital to pick up his family as \"there were no taxis\". The night before Mr Cummings was so ill he \"could barely stand up\", he said, and his wife's Spectator piece described how he had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs for 10 days. As he had coronavirus symptoms like fever, Mr Cummings was supposed to be isolating. On this car journey, Mr Cummings said he did not get out or have contact with any strangers. But were other forms of transport available? There were taxi firms who were taking patients home from hospital in Durham at that point. However, the government guidance told self-isolating people: \"Do not use public transport or taxis.\" But in March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. Mr Cummings confirmed that his son was tested upon leaving the hospital, but did not receive his negative result until \"a few days later\". So an ambulance could have taken them home. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they \"could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service\" in early April. Mr Cummings was seen running out of 10 Downing Street on 27 March. His wife, Mary Wakefield, in an article for the Spectator magazine about having the virus, wrote: \"My husband did rush home to look after me.\" In his press conference in the Downing Street rose garden, Mr Cummings said his wife was feeling a bit better after a couple of hours. \"There were many critical things at work and she urged me to return in the afternoon and I did.\" Public Health England (PHE) guidance, published on 12 March, stated that along with the infected individual \"all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days\". Mr Cummings returned home again in the evening and spoke with his wife. \"She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever.\" In his prepared statement at the recent press conference Mr Cummings said: \"For years I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat from coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning.\" Journalists quickly found a blog by the adviser from last year that mentioned SARS a single time. But it was soon established by a bit of internet sleuthing that the blog had been edited to contain this coronavirus reference on the evening of 14 April this year, the day Mr Cummings returned to work from Durham. When originally published it had contained just a link to another article. Mr Cummings has not revealed why he made the edit when he did.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. The NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. The hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead. Anyone in England with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, with 700 contract tracers at the moment - increasing to 2,000 later. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop you from unknowingly spreading the virus. This means that you should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. The people you live with won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. The tracers can track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day, the government says. It's hoped the system - already used in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany - will slow the spread of coronavirus. The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident the \"vast majority of people\" would do their \"civic duty\" and follow the NHS test and trace instructions - which are currently voluntary. Since then, the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply \"we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house\". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a395.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions. There are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has urged the government to introduce \"enhanced\" sick pay. \"There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security,\" he said. A smartphone app which would automatically alert people that they've been in contact with someone with coronavirus is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight. It was originally due to be rolled out nationwide in mid-May, but the government now says it will be ready ''in the coming weeks''. With Bluetooth switched on, the app would work in tandem with manual tracing - and could help get hold of people who might not personally know the person who has tested positive. The Isle of Wight trial suggests that at the moment, because of lockdown, people have not been spending 15 minutes in the close company of many others - mainly only those with whom they live.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window After almost 10 weeks of lockdown, some restrictions are due to be eased. Families and friends will be able to reunite (outdoors and at a distance), people will be able to play some sports and visit garden centres, and councils are due to reopen their recycling centres. But with Nicola Sturgeon still urging people to \"stay at home\" as much as possible to contain the spread of the virus, life will remain far from normal. So what exactly can people in Scotland do from Friday? Expect a lot of socially-distanced picnics and barbecues this weekend. From Friday, one household can meet up with another household - as long as they are outside in areas like a park or a private garden. Despite weeks apart, they must resist the urge to hug each other as each family must remain two metres (6ft) from each other. Hand-washing and hygiene should also be a priority and people should avoid touching hard surfaces like gates, walls, fences and park benches. In total, the group meeting up should be no larger than eight - so two families-of-four can meet in the park but two households of five cannot. They are being asked to limit their meetings to one household per day, not meeting several families on the same day. And if they are planning to share a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. People will also need to think about the distance they are travelling to meet family and friends. The guidance says we should not go inside other people's homes - so if your destination is so far away that you will need to use someone else's bathroom, you should not go. With a warm weekend forecast, the first minister has given the green light to more outdoor recreation. From Friday, people will be allowed to sunbathe and sit in parks and open areas. They will be permitted to travel locally - by walking or cycling - for recreation, but the government's \"strong advice\" is that they should not go any further than five miles. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or local beauty spots. \"If you go somewhere and find it crowded, change your plans, use your judgement and go somewhere else,\" she said. However, people will also be able to get back to playing on golf courses, as restrictions are lifted on non-contact sports. Other sports which will be allowed include: The Scottish government says it is not an exhaustive list but people must use their own judgement and maintain physical distancing. One-on-one personal training and coaching is also permitted if it is outside and they can keep apart. Businesses like pubs, cinemas, theatres, hairdressers and clothing stores must remain closed during phase one of the lockdown easing. However, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open their doors from Friday, as long as they have distancing measures in place. The construction industry will be able to start preparing their sites for reopening in the future. And the government said it would no longer be discouraging drive-through food outlets from re-opening. Businesses which are not obliged by law to remain closed must ensure their employees can remain two metres from each other. Household waste recycling centres will also be allowed to re-open from Monday.

        "text": " Share this with Email Facebook Messenger Messenger Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp LinkedIn Copy this link These are external links and will open in a new window UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to Durham during lockdown. What did he do and what does the guidance say? 23 March: The prime minister tells the UK public they \"must stay at home\". People are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with. Those with symptoms had already been told to self-isolate. 27 March: Mr Cummings is seen leaving 10 Downing Street.  \"I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill.\"  He went home, but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work. Guidance: If Mr Cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus, the guidance was that \"all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days\". Evening: Mr Cummings went on to explain - \"That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever.\" Mr Cummings said many people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: \"I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.\" Later:  Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving \"at roughly midnight\". \"I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. \"My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier.\" Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child. Guidance: Stay at home is the simple government advice for households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms. However, the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved. It says: \"If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.\" Other government advice did not contain this caveat, such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of March to be sent to every house. Nor did the government page on essential travel which said: \"Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence.\" Durham Police said on 28 May that it did not consider that going to Durham had been an offence. The police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether Mr Cummings had breached the regulations, not the general government guidance to \"stay at home\". 28 March: Mr Cummings says he woke up \"in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever\". 30 March: A No 10 source confirmed Mr Cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating \"at home\". 1 April: Durham Constabulary speak to the father of Dominic Cummings who confirms that his son and family were present at the property. 2 April: During the night, Mr Cummings' four-year-old son \"threw up and had a bad fever\". Following medical advice, an ambulance took the child to hospital. He was accompanied by Mr Cummings' wife. Mr Cummings \"could barely stand up\". 3 April: After being taken to hospital, Mr Cummings' son woke up the next day having recovered. He was tested for coronavirus and his mother, who was with him at the hospital, was told \"they should return home\" (the test result arrived days later and was negative). According to Mr Cummings, there were no taxis so he \"drove to the hospital, picked him up and returned home\". He said he \"did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip\". But according to his wife's later article in the Spectator Mr Cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period. Guidance: People with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus and who do not require hospital treatment are told they \"must remain at home until they are well\". In March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they \"could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service\" in early April. 6 April: At some point in the week leading up to this date, Mr Cummings discussed his decision to travel to Durham with the prime minister. \"When we were both sick and in bed,\" he said, \"I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail.\" 4-11 April: Mr Cummings said \"after I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house\". He confirmed he, his wife and his son went for a walk into woods owned by his father and it was at this point he was seen by passers-by but his family \"had no interaction with them\". The exact date is not clear but his second week isolating in Durham would have between these two dates. Guidance: Advice concerning outdoor exercise changed during the second week in April, when Mr Cummings and his family walked in the woods. Until 9 April, people with coronavirus symptoms and their household were told they could exercise outdoors. On that date, the PHE advice changed to say \"any exercise should be taken within your home\". A separate NHS guidance page said people isolating could use their gardens. 11 April: Believing he had recovered by this date, albeit \"feeling weak and exhausted\", Mr Cummings said he \"sought expert medical advice\". \"I explained our family's symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on Monday or Tuesday, seek childcare and so on. I was told that it was safe and I could return to work.\" 12 April: Mr Cummings drives to Barnard Castle, about 25 miles from his parents' home in Durham, with his wife and child. He explained this episode as needing to test his driving was fine before making the long drive back to London. He said he'd been having problems with his vision. Guidance: On 28 May Durham Police said the drive to Barnard Castle \"might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention\". It added that the offence was minor because there did not appear to have been any breach of the social distancing rules. The statement said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to Barnard Castle, they would advised him to return to Durham. The constabulary said it would not be taking retrospective action against him because it would not do so against any other member of the public. There was no mention in the statement of whether Mr Cummings was fit to drive given his concerns about his eyesight. The 1988 Road Traffic Act says: \"If a person drives a motor vehicle on a road while his eyesight is such (whether through a defect which cannot be, or one which is not for the time being, sufficiently corrected) that he cannot comply with any requirement as to eyesight prescribed under this Part of this Act for the purposes of tests of competence to drive, he is guilty of an offence.\" The Highway Code says: \"You MUST report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) any health condition likely to affect your driving.\" Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable of Manchester Police, said the drive to Barnard Castle was potentially a criminal offence. \"It's not the way to test your eyesight and put, potentially, other people in danger.\" On Twitter, John Apter, chair of the Police Federation for England and Wales, said: \"If you're feeling unwell and your eyesight may be impaired do not drive your vehicle to test your ability to drive. It's not a wise move.\" Michael Gove also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. \"It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well.\" In the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - \"driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise\" was deemed not likely to be reasonable. Mr Cummings and his family walked a few yards and sat by a riverbank for a few minutes. 13 April: Mr Cummings and his family travel back to London. 14 April: Mr Cummings is seen in Downing Street for the first time since 27 March. In his recent press conference Mr Cummings said he had written \"about the possible threat from coronaviruses last year\" but it transpired an old blog was edited on the evening of 14 April to add a short section on this. 19 April: Five days after being in London, The Observer and Mirror report that Mr Cummings is seen again in Durham by an unnamed witness. Mr Cummings says he did not return to Durham and that evidence on his phone proves this. Mr Cummings insisted he did not break the law, saying: \"I believe that in all the circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in Number 10.\" He said \"I don't regret what I did\" and added that \"the rules make clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and the situation I was in was exceptional circumstances\".

While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19. Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether \"silent spreaders\" are fuelling the pandemic. When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China. As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it. The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on January 22, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise. But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims. \"We were extremely perplexed,\" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. \"People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,\" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then. So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out. Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple. \"They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,\" says Dr Lee. That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease. And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus? Investigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier. Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge. For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others. But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. \"Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.\" What was revealed was what's known as \"pre-symptomatic transmission\" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin. Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious. Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home. That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate. One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up. And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected. This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it. This is what's known as being \"asymptomatic\" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century. Wherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease. Reporters dubbed her \"Typhoid Mary\", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938. Staff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test. She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive. \"It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. \"I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'\" says 23-year-old Amelia. She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home. \"I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me.\" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. \"I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.\" At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view. The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test. An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded \"a petri dish for infection\", it had around 700 cases. Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms. And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness. Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that \"there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics\". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, \"perhaps a lot of cases\". The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help. \"I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,\" she says. \"But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.\" One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. \"As 'silent spreaders',\" the scientists wrote, \"asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.\" The team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases. To try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested. \"Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,\" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified. Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. \"If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,\" he says. \"Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.\" A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the \"Achilles Heel\" of the fight against the pandemic. In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has \"a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic\". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing. A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun. As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms. As lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing. That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade. When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it. Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits. Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try. When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: \"We've never seen anything like this before.\" They knew a new disease was coming, and they were expecting resources to be stretched by an unknown respiratory infection which had first appeared in China at the end of last year. \"It felt in some ways like we were trying to prepare for the D-Day landings,\" says Barbara Miles, clinical director of intensive care at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, \"with three weeks to get ready and not a great deal of knowledge about what we would be facing\".
