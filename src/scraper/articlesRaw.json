        "text": "Boris Johnson's \"mismanagement\" of the easing of virus restrictions risks a second wave of infections, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned. In his strongest criticism yet of the PM's handling of the crisis, he told the Guardian that Mr Johnson must \"get a grip\" and restore public trust. He said there was a suspicion the PM was \"winging it\" over moves to reopen schools and relax shielding advice. But No 10 said it was proceeding with caution to secure a safe recovery. Mr Johnson and Sir Keir will later go head-to-head at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time since the row over Dominic Cummings' conduct erupted. Also later on Wednesday, the government will give more details of its proposals to require the majority of those arriving in the UK to self-isolate for 14 days amid criticism of the quarantine plan from many Conservative MPs. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Home Secretary Priti Patel and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said \"we owe it to the thousands who have died\" to introduce measures to risk imported cases over the summer months. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has suggested the UK is beginning to \"win the battle\" against the virus, which has now claimed the lives of nearly 40,000 people, according to the government's daily case figures. Separate data released by the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday suggested the number of people dying each week linked to the virus has dropped to its lowest levels in the UK since March. But some scientists, public health experts and opposition politicians have warned that Monday's easing of restrictions - which saw the partial re-opening of primary schools, the resumption of some sports, the re-opening of covered markets and new freedoms for those previously shielding to leave the house - are premature. The changes came despite the fact the Covid-19 alert level has yet to be officially lowered from four to three. Sir Keir said while Labour wanted to see society re-open and businesses begin to get back on their feet, he had deep misgivings about the approach in England, compared with that in Wales and Scotland. He said children had returned to schools before the system for identifying new cases and tracing their contacts was fully up and running while public health officials had been given no notice of the changes to shielding advice for the most vulnerable - which was announced a month before a review had been due to take place. \"After a week or more of mismanagement, I'm deeply concerned the government has made a difficult situation 10 times worse,\" he said. \"We've called for an exit strategy. What we appear to have got is an exit without a strategy.\" He warned that trust in the government had been \"burnt\" at a crucial time by the controversy surrounding the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings and whether he broke the lockdown rules. \"Like many people across the country, there is a growing concern the government is now winging it,\" Sir Keir said. \"At precisely the time when there should have been maximum trust in the government, confidence has collapsed. \"I am putting the prime minister on notice that he has got to get a grip and restore public confidence in the government's handling of the epidemic. \"If we see a sharp rise in the R rate, the infection rate, or a swathe of local lockdowns, responsibility for that falls squarely at the door of No 10.\" Asked about the likelihood of a second spike in infections on Tuesday, England's national testing co-ordinator Professor John Newton said it was \"patchy\" and any resurgence was likely to be \"localised\". But leading epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, whose modelling the government relied on in the first phase of the outbreak, warned that infections in hospitals and care homes are spilling into the community and sustaining the outbreak to the point that cases will remain steady until September. A Downing Street spokesman said its focus was on \"helping the country recover safely from coronavirus and restoring the livelihoods of millions of people across the country\". \"Now is the time to look to the future and not the past, as we continue to fight this virus while taking cautious steps to ease restrictions. The PM looks forward to hearing any concrete proposals Labour has to offer.\" The BBC understands the PM has established two new cabinet committees to support the next phase of the Covid response - one overseeing the strategy for the recovery and the other the delivery of policy."

        "text": "People from ethnic minorities are at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus, a report by Public Health England says. It shows age remains the biggest risk factor, while being male is another. The impact of Covid-19 is also \"disproportionate\" for other Asian, Caribbean and black ethnicities. But it remains unclear why. A trade union for doctors said the report was a \"missed opportunity\" for \"action\" to be taken to protect health workers who are from ethnic minorities. The health secretary said the \"troubling\" report was \"timely\" because \"right across the world people are angry about racial injustice\". On Monday night, the Department of Health and Social Care denied reports the delay was down to official concerns of potential civil unrest linked to global anger over the death of African-American George Floyd. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons the public was \"understandably angry about injustices\" and that he felt a \"deep responsibility because this pandemic has exposed huge disparities in the health of our nation\". \"Black lives matter, as do those of the poorest areas of our country which have worse health outcomes and we need to make sure all of these considerations are taken into account, and action is taken to level-up the health outcomes of people across this country,\" he said. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Hancock said \"much more work\" needed to be done to understand \"what's driving these disparities\". \"We are absolutely determined to get to the bottom of this and find ways of closing this gap,\" he said, adding that he has asked equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to continue working on the issue alongside Public Health England (PHE). The BBC's Rianna Croxford pressed Mr Hancock on whether there were any specific recommendations for people from ethnic minority backgrounds. He said everyone in \"the different high risk categories\" highlighted in the report should follow social distancing guidelines \"very stringently\". Prof John Newton said although the virus was having a worse impact on black and minority ethnic people, \"that is not necessarily because of their ethnicity\" and could instead be related to their job, for example. He said the report's findings needed to be \"widely discussed before deciding exactly what needs to be done\". \"The report if nothing else emphasises the complexity of what we're seeing, so really we're urging people not to jump to conclusions and institute measures which are not really justified by the data,\" he added. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said \"lives depend on\" finding out why the virus disproportionately impacts black and minority ethnic people, and what actions the government was taking to stop it. Davida Wilkins, a 38-year-old district nurse in the West Midlands, told the BBC she felt \"even more anxious\" about doing her job following the report's publication. She said she felt \"obligated\" to continue her front-line role but added she cannot minimise the risks posed to her by the virus because \"it's the colour that I am and I can't change it\". The rapid review was launched when it became clear that some people were getting more sick with coronavirus than others. PHE reviewed thousands of existing health records and other virus data to look at disparities by: It is not possible to combine all of these factors together to judge an individual's risk because of the way the source data is recorded, but the data does reveal clear inequalities. The analysis on ethnicity and risk did not consider a person's occupation or obesity, even though both are known risk factors for getting seriously ill with coronavirus. The report also found: The government had been under pressure to publish the findings of this inquiry. It was due to be released by the end of May. Now it's here, it's not clear why there was a delay. The main findings reinforce what we already know - that belonging to an ethnic minority group is a major risk factor. It doesn't move us forward in answering why, though. The report acknowledges an important flaw in the analysis - it couldn't factor in important risks, such as a person's job and underlying health conditions, that increase the chance of dying with coronavirus. Where you live and how much you earn are important considerations too. Death rates for people living in the most deprived areas of England were more than double the least deprived areas. The report says coronavirus has replicated and in some cases increased existing health inequalities. It doesn't mention how to address those to save more lives. It acknowledges that more work is needed to understand and advise people about the risks. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the report for not providing recommendations for at-risk groups, adding that the virus \"thrives on inequality\" and \"inequality thrives on inaction\". Labour MP for Battersea Marsha de Cordova said the report was \"notably silent\" on how risks amplified by \"racial and health inequalities\" could be reduced. She said the government \"must act immediately\" to mitigate the risks \"so that no more lives are lost\". While Labour MP for Tottenham David Lammy said families \"are living in fear\" and the government \"must take urgent action to protect at-risk groups\". Gill Walton, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, said while the report's conclusions were \"helpful... it does nothing to protect people\". She said \"clear guidance and support\" from the government should be given to help the NHS tackle the risk to workers. The Royal College of Nursing pointed out that health care staff from black and ethnic minority groups faced an increased risk from the virus and that \"swift and comprehensive action\" was needed to protect workers. While the council chair of the BMA, the doctors' trade union, said the report was a \"missed opportunity\". \"The BMA and the wider community were hoping for a clear action plan to tackle the issues, not a re-iteration of what we already know. We need practical guidance,\" Dr Chaand Nagpaul said. The equality watchdog says the government should produce a \"comprehensive race equality strategy\" in response to the report. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said: \"People are more than statistics, and we cannot afford to ignore the broader context of entrenched race inequality across all areas of life. Only a comprehensive race equality strategy will address these issues.\" Latest government figures show 39,369 people with coronavirus have died in the UK, across all settings, with an increase of 324 deaths on Monday's figures. There were 1,613 new positive cases recorded in the past day."

        "text": "The owner of Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkel's is set to tell staff that a \"large number\" of its outlets will not reopen after lockdown. In an email to staff seen by the BBC, the Restaurant Group says many sites are \"no longer viable to trade and will remain closed permanently.\" The group appears to be speeding up previous plans to shut restaurants as trade suffers due to the pandemic. Staff will be told if their workplaces will remain shut by email on Wednesday. \"The Covid-19 crisis has significantly impacted our ability to trade profitably, so we've taken the tough decision to close these restaurants now,\" the email said. The message was sent to managers in the group's Leisure Division, which includes more than 200 Frankie & Benny's outlets. It is not yet clear which ones will be shut, or how many. Those currently working in sites due to stay closed were told: \"Unfortunately, unless there are any suitable alternative roles identified, it's likely your role will be made redundant.\" Restaurant Group has declined to comment. It is one of Britain's largest restaurant operators, with some 22,000 staff currently on furlough. It also owns the Wagamama chain and some pub units, which are not part of the division which received the email. The Restaurant Group also said in March that 61 out of 80 branches of its Tex-Mex dining chain Chiquito's would remain closed permanently as it fell into administration. It cited the Covid-19 outbreak as having had \"an immediate and significant impact on trading\". However, the group had already announced in February, prior to the introduction of lockdown measures, that it would speed up existing plans to close restaurants. Initially it had planned to make 150 closures - which were first signalled in 2019 - over a six-year period. It then said it would close 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. \"I feel completely overwhelmed and upset,\" says Georgia. She has been working as a part-time waitress at one Frankie & Benny's outlet since last April. \"I'm angry, as they feel as though staff are disposable,\" she says, adding that the lack of certainty around work amid lockdown has created mental stress. \"I just can't believe that they would send that kind of message to managers without any warning,\" she adds. The group had already seen sales falling across many outlets. That came despite stronger revenues across the wider group in its Wagamamas and pub units. It said in February that like-for-like sales in its leisure business (stripping out the effect of new restaurants opening), which includes Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito, fell by 2.8% in 2019. Many casual dining chains had already been struggling in the face of rising overheads and falling consumer spending. But those in the hospitality sector have seen their problems worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic, as customers have been forced to stay at home amid lockdown. Carluccio's, for example, was bought out of administration by the owner of Giraffe restaurants. Despite its rescue, more than 1,000 jobs will be lost at the Italian restaurant chain, more than half of its total workforce. The administrators said the lockdown meant difficult decisions had to be taken. Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 forced most cafes and restaurants to close in March, but some have since reopened as takeaways only. When lockdown was initially announced in March, trade association Hospitality UK said it was \"catastrophic for businesses and jobs\". Its chief executive Kate Nicholls warned at the time that the measures could \"lead to thousands of businesses closing their doors for good, and hundreds of thousands of job losses\". Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest in England, if they can meet social distancing measures."

        "text": "When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (\u00a31.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. \"It's a huge opportunity,\" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. \"What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,\" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. \"Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,\" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. \"It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,\" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. \"The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,\" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. \"They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,\" he says. \"They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.\""

        "text": "The UK is being urged to halt all sales of riot control equipment to the United States amid concerns they may be being used by police to suppress protests over the death of George Floyd. Labour said the UK had licensed exports of tear gas and riot shields in the past year and any use for internal repression would contravene the law. It wants existing and new orders to be stopped pending a review. Ministers have condemned Mr Floyd's death but not commented further. The African-American's death in police custody in Minneapolis on 25 May prompted an international outcry and sparked a wave of peaceful and violent protests across the US. Dozens of people have been injured as authorities used tear gas and force to disperse protests which have swept more than 75 cities. President Trump has urged state governors to mobilise their national guard to control the protests and threatened to send in the military to quell the disturbances. Labour is urging ministers to clarify whether any UK-made equipment is being used by US police in their operations and, if it is, for all future orders to be immediately suspended. Shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry said police forces across the US had used \"excessive force\" against peaceful protesters, including children, and it was an \"obvious matter of concern\" that UK-made equipment could potentially be used to \"crush\" legitimate demonstrations. She has urged International Trade Secretary Liz Truss to publish details of all current riot control exports, who has bought them and for what purpose over the past five years. She said a recent report from the Department for International Trade suggests licences granted include for anti-riot shields, anti-riot guns, portable riot control electric shock devices, tear gas and components for anti-riot guns. Ms Thornberry said ministers should not \"shirk\" their duty to uphold basic human rights because of the UK's close relationship with the US, with the two countries historic alliance making it all the more important for the UK to act. \"It has been the policy of successive governments over the past two decades to refuse licences for the export of arms and equipment that might be used for internal repression in the countries to whom they are being sold. \"If there is a risk that any of these riot control projectiles and equipment are being used in the United States against peaceful, unarmed civilians, then the government must act immediately to stop their export \"The British public deserve to know how arms exported by this country are being used across the world, and the American public deserve the right to protest peacefully without the threat of violent repression.\" Meanwhile, Labour's Dawn Butler has said she is seeking support from MPs from other parties to increase pressure on the government and will release details of names on Wednesday. I am co-ordinating a growing group of cross party MPs who will be calling on our government @trussliz to halt the sale of tear gas, rubber bullets, and riot shields to the US. Full list will be published on Friday. End of Twitter post  by @DawnButlerBrent The UK government has condemned the killing of Mr Floyd and welcomed the fact that a Minneapolis police officer has been charged with his murder. But ministers have refrained from criticising President Trump's response to the ensuing protests, saying they do not want to get involved in another country's domestic affairs. Speaking on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged a de-escalation in tensions but said it was \"not his job\" to comments on the President's handling of the unrest."

        "text": "The use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to treat people with depression should be immediately suspended, according to a new study. ECT involves passing electric currents through a patient's brain to cause seizures or fits. The study's lead author says there was \"no place\" for ECT in evidence-based medicine due to risks of brain damage. At least 1,600 patients were given ECT in the UK and Ireland in 2017, according to psychiatrists. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) currently recommends the use of ECT for some cases of moderate or severe depression as well as catatonia and mania. However, peer-reviewed research published in the journal Ethical Human Psychology and Psychiatry concludes \"the high risk of permanent memory loss and the small mortality risk means that its use should be immediately suspended\". NICE says their guidance for ECT was last reviewed in 2014 but it would look at it again if new evidence was likely to affect their recommendations. The study's lead author, Dr John Read, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of East London, describes previous research justifying the use of ECT in the UK and around the world as \"the lowest quality of any I have seen in my 40-year career\". The paper concedes that \"the severity and significance of the brain damage and memory loss (following ECT) is rarely studied\". However, the researchers go on to say \"it is not hard to find hundreds of personal accounts of debilitating levels of disruption to people's lives\". In 2018, a class action case was settled in the US after a federal court ruled that a reasonable jury could find against manufacturers of ECT equipment if they failed to warn of the dangers of brain damage. One manufacturer, Somatics, immediately added \"permanent brain damage\" to the list of risks from the treatment. The research criticises a British review of the evidence conducted in 2003 for ignoring the lack of data. The UK ECT Review Group \"fails to acknowledge any of these major problems and unquestioningly included the strong finding in favour of ECT\", it says. The article argues the quality of previous studies into ECT is so poor, they \"were wrong to conclude anything about efficacy, either during or beyond the treatment period\". \"There is no evidence that ECT is effective for its target demographic\u2014older women, or its target diagnostic group\u2014severely depressed people, or for suicidal people, people who have unsuccessfully tried other treatments first, involuntary patients, or children and adolescent\", it says. The paper suggests the placebo effect may explain why some patients say they find ECT helpful. The study's joint author, Prof Irving Kirsch, an expert on placebo effects based at Harvard Medical School, says \"the failure to find any meaningful benefits in long-term benefits compared to placebo groups are particularly distressing. \"On the basis of the clinical trial data, ECT should not be used for depressed individuals.\""

        "text": "Portugal's foreign minister has said anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer would be \"most welcome\" amid coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva said tourists will be warned how full beaches are so that they can avoided crowded spots. Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an \"air bridge\" agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June. Holidaymakers would not be subject to a 14-day quarantine under a deal. He said any travel quarantine \"was an enemy of tourism\", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said \"rules\" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer will be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as \"clean and safe\". Later on Wednesday, the UK home secretary will tell MPs that a travel quarantine is needed \"to prevent a second wave of the virus.\" Priti Patel will also say that \"air bridges\" between the UK and countries with low Covid-19 infection rates are possible in the future, so that people arriving from certain places will not have to self-isolate. Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were ongoing with the UK. Mr Santos Silva said that he was hopeful that an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country. Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out \"random testing\" on passengers. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has said it will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people \"could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance.\" People who break the rules could be fined \u00a31,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks. When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include the rate of infection internationally, prevention measures in other countries, the extent to which other countries with more relaxed border arrangements have seen imported cases, as well as the effectiveness of testing methods at minimising the risk of new cases of the virus entering the country. A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a \"high number of coronavirus cases.\" Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine wasn't introduced some weeks ago. New figures show that between the beginning of January and the end of April, 14,225 flights arrived into UK airports."

        "text": "A convicted paedophile who was snared by a vigilante group is to have his case examined at the UK Supreme Court. Judges at the UK's highest court will consider whether prosecutions based on the covert operations of \"paedophile hunters\" breach the right to privacy. Mark Sutherland, 37, believed he was communicating with a 13-year-old boy on the dating app Grindr. But in reality it was a 48-year-old man who was part of a group called Groom Resisters Scotland. The Supreme Court will hold a virtual hearing to consider the case and will issue its judgement later. It will decide whether covert sting operations by vigilante groups are a breach of the right to a private life and private correspondence under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The court defines \"paedophile hunters\" as self-appointed groups of vigilantes who impersonate children in order to expose people whom they consider to be sexual predators. It says some of these groups have attracted substantial online followings and debate in mainstream media. When Sutherland was tried at Glasgow Sheriff Court in 2018, the jury heard he had sent explicit pictures to what he believed was a 13-year-old boy, called James Boyle, whom he had contacted on the dating site Grindr. Even though he was told James was just 13, he sent explicit pictures and made arrangements to meet up. But the person Sutherland was talking to was in fact Paul Devine, a member of the group Groom Resistance Scotland. When Sutherland arrived at Partick Bus Station in Glasgow to meet the boy, he was intercepted by the vigilante group who streamed their encounter live on social media. They informed police and Sutherland was arrested. He was unanimously found guilty of two charges of attempting to communicate indecently with an older child. Sheriff Martin Jones QC jailed Sutherland for a total of two years. Sutherland had previously been imprisoned in 2015 for 21 months after sending a 12-year-old boy explicit pictures and inappropriate messages two years earlier. The case before the Supreme Court justices is very important as the law surrounding the activities of \"paedophile hunters\" is currently unclear. Yet according to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in Scotland (HMICS) almost half of online grooming cases result from the activities of vigilante groups. The inspectorate said these groups are unregulated and untrained, and in its report in February 2020 said: \"A more robust proactive capability on the part of Police Scotland would reduce the opportunities for these groups to operate.\" Although Mark Sutherland was convicted by a jury at Glasgow Sheriff Court, a later case in Dundee was thrown out because evidence gained by a vigilante group was ruled \"inadmissible.\" In that case the sheriff said the means used to induce the accused, known only as PHP, into engaging in an exchange of messages amounted to \"fraud\". PHP's lawyers said the vigilantes' activities interfered with his rights under ECHR Article 8 and using their evidence in any trial would mean the court was acting \"incompatibly\" with those rights. They also argued the use of information gathered covertly was unlawful under legislation designed to to ensure the surveillance of a person was properly regulated. Those arguments were rejected by the sheriff, but he said by pretending falsely to be young children, the vigilantes had acted unlawfully. The case at the Supreme Court is being watched carefully by England's Director of Public Prosecutions who has been granted \"intervener\" status. The judgement, which will be issued later, will provide a definitive answer to the question of whether undercover vigilante activity is legal, and compatible with human rights, even of those who seek to abuse children.

        "text": "Students might have to stay in a \"protective bubble\" of the same small group, when the UK's university campuses reopen in the autumn. University leaders suggested students would live and study with the same group to minimise mixing. They were setting out safety measures for a socially-distanced student life - including a virtual freshers' week. A survey suggested 71% of students would prefer to start the term later, if they got more in-person teaching. University campuses have been closed since the coronavirus lockdown, with teaching switching online, and their representative body, Universities UK has been setting out how they might bring students back for the autumn term. To prevent the risk of infection, the Universities UK briefing suggested students could be kept in small groups, sharing accommodation with people taking the same course, using the \"protective bubble\" approach used in primary schools in England. Liz Barnes, vice-chancellor of Staffordshire University, said she had been discussing the idea of protective bubbles with other universities - with her university expecting to have eight people per bubble. By housing students in groups taking the same subjects, with timetables that bring them on campus at the same time, it would minimise contact with other students. \"The more that we can keep them into a small group of regular interaction the better in current circumstances,\" said Prof Barnes. Students could see others outside, but there would be controls on who could go inside accommodation. This would also assume that university accommodation would have a big reduction in capacity, so that social distancing could be possible and facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms could be safely shared. If lectures are delivered online, there would also be fewer people on campus. The first week of university life - or freshers' week - is where students get a chance to socialise together. But University of Nottingham vice-chancellor, Shearer West, said it might not be \"all singing, all dancing\" this year. This could be the case literally as well as metaphorically, if welcome events are online or restricted to small numbers. \"We're certainly planning to have people join things and get involved in societies, but we may just have to run freshers' fair in a different kind of way,\" said Prof West. These could be \"virtual events,\" said Universities UK president Julia Buckingham. But in a way that \"we can guarantee students have social interaction with one another\". Most likely a bit of both. The term being used is \"blended\", where students get a mix of online lectures and then in-person teaching for smaller groups. But individual students will want to know the balance for their chosen subject - how much will they be studying on campus and how much by distance learning? Prof Buckingham, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, said she wanted to \"dispel the image\" that learning online was not the same quality. And even if courses are entirely online, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has said universities in England can charge full tuition fees. According to a survey from the University and College Union, 71% of students would prefer to push back the start of term, if it meant they had more in-person and less online teaching. The survey of 516 people applying to university this year also found 23% were worried that their preferred university could go bust because of the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Buckingham suggested there would be flexibility for overseas students to start in January, if they were unable to travel for the autumn. Some students might want to defer a year entirely to get a better experience. But with the prospect of no travel, few jobs and a socially-distanced social life, it's also been described as being the world's worst gap year. \"Students need clarity as to what they can expect from the next academic year in order for them to make informed choices,\" says the National Union of Students. The deadline for making a firm choice of university is 18 June - and the higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, says applicants have to be told with \"absolute clarity\" how they will be taught. And if a university subsequently changes what it offers then students should be released from their choices. While the guidance from Universities UK sets out ideas and broad principles, students will want to know about their individual options. Will accommodation be available? How many hours of in-person teaching will there be? What campus facilities will be open? Will freshers' week be a laptop in their bedroom?"

A London Overground train driver, an east London midwife and a King's Cross supermarket worker will all feature on July's front page. Photographer Jamie Hawkesworth captured the trio of women for a 20-page portfolio for the fashion magazine. \"They represent the millions of people in the UK who, at the height of the pandemic, put on their uniforms and went to help,\" Vogue's editor-in-chief Edward Enninful said. \"This moment in history required something extra special, a moment of thanks to the new front line.\" Rachel Millar, 24, has worked as a community midwife at Homerton Hospital, in east London, for almost three years. She was on shift on one of the delivery suites at the hospital when a team from Vogue came in to take portraits of numerous staff for what she believed was to be a feature on NHS staff. Talking to the BBC, Rachel, who lives in Leyton, described being on the cover of British Vogue as \"surreal\". \"I'm a bit overwhelmed - but in a good way. I had no idea it would be what I now know it is,\" she said. \"I've had so many lovely comments about it and I think people have enjoyed seeing someone from the NHS on the cover. \"I feel it has given the NHS a lot of recognition and a lot of love to jobs that were perhaps previously overlooked.\" Narguis Horsford, who has worked for Transport for London for 10 years and driven London Overground trains for the past five, said her manager called her to ask if she would like to do an interview for  the magazine. \"At first I thought he was winding me up,\" she said. \"But it later turned out to be very real.\" Narguis, who lives Bounds Green, north London, said: \"I feel amazing to be representing the female front-line key workers. \"It's very important to highlight the hard work and contributions that we do to keep London moving and to provide services that everyone needs. \"NHS workers are obviously very important, but it's also good to highlight other workers in other sectors.\" Nargius said she initially felt anxious going to work during the coronavirus outbreak but has since gone on to feel an immense sense of pride. \"I am proud to be a key worker and proud to be a train driver, taking those important workers to work.\" Also featuring on the cover is Anisa Omar, who works as supermarket assistant at the London King's Cross branch of Waitrose. The 21-year-old, who lives in Islington with her parents, said the pandemic has given her a new sense of pride in her work. \"My job was not something that was that big of a deal before,\" she said."

Several brands seem to be affected, including Samsung and Google's Pixel. The bug makes the screen turn on and off continuously. In some cases a factory reset is required. The BBC does not recommend trying it out. Samsung is due to roll out a maintenance update on 11 June. The BBC has contacted Google for comment but not yet had a response. A tweet on the issue has had thousands of likes and re-tweets, with some reporting that their phone has also been affected. WARNING\uff01\uff01\uff01Never set this picture as wallpaper, especially for Samsung mobile phone users!It will cause your phone to crash!Don't try it!If someone sends you this picture, please ignore it. pic.twitter.com/rVbozJdhkL End of Twitter post  by @UniverseIce Tech journalist Bogdan Petrovan at Android Authority said the bug did not affect his Huawei 20 Pro but it did cause a Google Pixel 2 to malfunction. \"After setting the image in question as a wallpaper, the phone immediately crashed. It attempted to reboot, but the screen would constantly turn on and off, making it impossible to pass the security screen,\" he noted. Restarting the device in safe mode (by holding down the volume button during boot-up) did not fix the issue.\" It appears to affect some but not all devices running the latest version of the Android operating system, Android 10. The launch event for Android 11 was due to take place this week but has been postponed. There has not yet been an official reason given for the bug but developer Dylan Roussel, who writes at 9to5Google tweeted his theory. Ken Munro and Dave Lodge from security firm Pen Test partners also analysed it for the BBC. \"As digital photographs have improved in quality, phones need to check what the image 'colour space' is to work out how to display it properly,\" they said. \"It's how a phone knows how to display exactly the right shade of green, for example. \"There are different ways of defining the colour space. Some spaces have specialist uses in graphic design, so sometimes you'll see images that aren't in the usual 'Standard RGB' format. It's also possible to deliberately create images that have more colour information than some devices can handle. \"What's happened here is that the way some phones deal with these cases has gone wrong. \"The phone crashes because it doesn't know how to deal with it correctly, and the software developers probably hadn't considered this might happen.\""

A federal judge has given Carole Baskin control of Joe Exotic's old zoo in Oklahoma as part of a ruling in a $1m (\u00a3800,000) trademark dispute. Joe Exotic is currently serving a 22-year sentence for his involvement in a murder-for-hire plot and animal abuse. The zoo's current operator has been ordered to leave within 120 days. Tiger King, which became a huge hit on Netflix in March, tells of Joe Exotic's colourful life and his rivalry with Baskin, the owner of an animal sanctuary in Florida. The rivalry extended to Exotic - real name Joseph Maldonado-Passage - using logos that resembled those owned by Baskin's Big Cat Rescue company. Baskin sued Exotic for trademark infringement in 2011, a case that ended two years later with the latter being ordered to pay Big Cat Rescue $1m. In 2016, Big Cat Rescue sued Exotic's mother Shirley Schreibvogel, claiming he had fraudulently transferred his zoo to her to avoid paying Baskin and other creditors. According to documents posted online, US District Judge Scott L Palk found the transfer had been made to \"remove [the zoo] from the reach of Big Cat Rescue\". Jeff Lowe, Joe Exotic's former business partner, has been told to vacate the premises in Wynnewood, Oklahoma, and remove all of his exotic animals. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

Joyce Richardson, from Thirsk, North Yorkshire, raised the money for Herriot Hospice Homecare in Northallerton, which cared for her son. Having nearly lost the use of her legs after developing sepsis last year, she said each stand was a \"huge struggle\". She thanked everyone who donated, saying \"it's absolutely wonderful.\" Mrs Richardson's eldest son Gill, 74, was cared for by the charity before he died last October. The great-great grandmother said she wanted to thank the charity for \"the wonderful support\" her family received. She set out to raise \u00a31,000 for the charity, but donations to her JustGiving page now total \u00a316, 873 and the charity says with money sent inside cards, the total is almost \u00a318,000. She said: \"When I started it I thought if I raised \u00a31,000 I would do very well, but I'm absolutely amazed how generous people have been.\" Mrs Richardson has been congratulated by Captain Tom Moore, who tweeted his support on her birthday. He wrote: \"Welcome to the club Joyce, 100 years young today! \"And congratulations on your challenge for a great cause.  Stay safe #TomorrowWillBeAGoodDay\" Mrs Richardson shared a picture of herself on her JustGiving page as a 21-year-old in the Women's Land Army in 1941. She said: \"The challenge would have been easy for me too, in those days.\" Herriot Hospice Homecare provides home care in the communities in the Hambleton and Richmond areas. Chief Executive Tony Collins said it was a \"remarkable achievement\". He said: \"She has put everything into it, just the sheer encouragement to the staff knowing they are being supported in this way, it's really put a smile on their faces.\" He said the charity needs about \u00a31m a year to continue the services it provides, and the money would be spent \"very wisely\".

        "text": "This week, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the BBC has recorded its first programme with a live audience listening from home. Could this be the new normal for radio comedy shows? \"Can you give us a cheer so we know you're there? That's great! Now can you laugh as if I just said something really hilarious?\" It's Monday evening, and Radio 4 producer Sasha Feachem is warming up the audience ahead of a recording of science comedy show The Infinite Monkey Cage. But we, the audience, are not in the BBC's radio theatre as we normally would be. Instead we've tuned in over Zoom to hear a new episode of the programme being recorded virtually. For the next hour or so, it's our job to react to whatever the panellists are saying - starting with a quick sound check that sees us clapping, cheering and (fake) laughing. Behaving as if you're a member of a big crowd when you're sitting at home feels strange. But there's no doubt it adds something we've all been missing from comedy programmes recently - namely, atmosphere. \"That was wonderful,\" presenter Robin Ince says as the programme gets going. \"The idea that there are loads of people sitting alone in their house just applauding, and everyone in their street is going 'Oh my god, is it 8pm on Thursday already?'\" The Infinite Monkey Cage is the perfect show on which to test out a virtual audience. You can imagine the show's dedicated fans being delighted to take part in a recording which is itself an experiment. Furthermore, it won't be a major disaster if it doesn't work. Because Monkey Cage is a science programme and not exclusively a comedy show, there isn't the constant reliance on laughter there would be on The Now Show, Dead Ringers or Just A Minute. Ince and co-host Brian Cox tell the at-home audience the episode will combine space, genetics and archaeology, with guests including comedian Sara Pascoe, biological anthropologist Alice Roberts and archaeologist Sarah Parcak. And with that, we're off. The panellists rattle through topics including Ancient Egypt, undiscovered civilisations in Africa and how much Neanderthal DNA is present in humans today. All the guests appear on screen as part of a group Zoom meeting - with the audience represented, appropriately, by an image of an empty auditorium. But in every other way, it's just like a normal episode of The Infinite Monkey Cage. As audience members we can hear each others' reactions to what the panel says, which itself encourages us to laugh or clap more. We can't see each other, so it's not clear how many of us there are. But even a crowd with fewer than 100 people in it is enough to add some much-needed pace and momentum. There's only one technical hitch in the whole recording, which comes just as Parcak is discussing early erotic poetry. \"One of my favourite things to do if I'm teaching an archaeology class around Valentine's Day is to read ancient Egyptian love poetry - and it will turn your ears purple,\" she laughs. \"It's incredibly erotic, they were extraordinarily expressive of love. They talk about having their hearts broken, cheating husbands, the same stuff we read today - it's glorious.\" At this point, producer Sasha has to interrupt the recording briefly to fix a technical problem with one of the microphones. \"Isn't that typical!\" jokes Ince. \"Just as we get to the filth. Typical BBC, isn't it?\" Fortunately things get back on track and Parcak picks up with a tale of some of the earliest recorded pornography. You can hear the audience laughing heartily as she describes Egyptian papyrus that featured drawings of dancing lions or cats playing games on one side and erotic drawings on the other. \"That's essentially the internet now - it's half porn and half cats playing the piano,\" jokes Pascoe, prompting much laughter from the virtual crowd. This recording is the first proper attempt by the BBC to recreate what live comedy used to be like, before the coronavirus pandemic. Some comedy programmes have struggled to maintain their usual momentum recently, including Have I Got News For You and The Graham Norton Show. While the quality of the writing and the interviews on these recent episodes may be as strong as ever, the jokes still fall flat when met with the sound of silence. And so, depending on what the finished product is like once it's edited, Monkey Cage could provide a blueprint of how comedy shows will sound for the next few months or more. The episode we attend on Monday, which will be released as a podcast next week, lasts a little over an hour and will be chopped down to about 30 minutes. It's hard to predict how it will sound on air. During the recording the noise of other audience members is relatively quiet in the mix, so as not to drown out the panellists. But when everything is mixed for broadcast, and the audience can be heard at normal volume, it's likely the presence of a crowd will make a significant difference. There's no doubt that the programme is better, funnier and livelier with a virtual audience. It's not perfect, and certainly not as good as the real thing. But until some kind of normality can resume, it works perfectly well for now. As Ince puts it: \"What a strange, beautiful thing it is. We're alone but we're together.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

In Derbyshire, 80-year-old Sheila also saw her grandchildren again for the first time in 10 weeks. In Aberdeenshire, the Wilkie and Stephen families wore face masks when they got together. Margaret Stephen says:  \"Eighty-six-year-old Nanny hadn't seen all her grandchildren for 11 weeks\".

        "text": "If you often find yourself quietly (or loudly) sobbing at an emotional film, here's a warning - get an extra box of tissues before watching the films mentioned in this article. When US film critic Kevin Lee asked people to tell him \"the hardest you've ever cried in a movie/TV show\" on Twitter last week, he was unprepared for the onslaught that followed. \"Within the first six hours, the responses were unlike anything I've ever received before,\" he says. \"It was a little bit scary to tell you the truth.\" The hardest you've ever cried in a movie/TV show. Go. End of Twitter post  by @Klee_FilmReview Film fans bombarded him with the titles that have left them in puddles of tears. He was even more surprised that some replies were accompanied by personal stories about why the films meant so much. \"The responses were very sweet and each one was so different,\" he says. The BBC has analysed 35,000 replies. The top two tear-jerking films are not sweeping epics or heavyweight dramas - they are family favourites that tug hard at the heartstrings. Disney/Pixar's Oscar-winning 2017 animation Coco tops the mentions, thanks to its powerful story of a Mexican boy who crosses to the Land of the Dead and uncovers his family secrets while following his dream of becoming a musician. It is followed closely by 2008's Marley and Me, in which Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston's couple adopt an unruly Labrador, which accompanies them through their family life. Those two films were some way above anything else. This is not a scientific survey of course, but here are the top 10 films mentioned in replies to Kevin Lee's tweet. Lee, who writes for Film Inquiry and That Shelf, was not surprised to see Coco at the top of the list. \"I adored that film, and it just gets better and better with every viewing,\" he tells BBC News. \"It takes familiar messages like 'pursue your dream' but adds extra layers, such as understanding your heritage, how that shapes you, how you help that culture evolve, and it honours those traditions while still being progressive and moving forward. \"And the story is so emotional and the characters are so relatable - I think that is what got to many, many audiences.\" DEFINITELY coco. saw it 5 times in theaters and who knows how many on tv. still cry waterfalls and sob until my throat, head and chest hurts \ud83d\ude2c End of Twitter post  by @nathvods Marley and me, I wanted a happy dog movie as a kid and it broke me! End of Twitter post  by @Deep_Dreaming_ Three animations, all Disney/Pixar creations, are in the top 10. Up is another cross-generational story, while Toy Story 3 has been described by Buzzfeed as \"probably one of the saddest movies of this generation\". Lee says he is a \"sucker\" for animated films because it's easier to be transported to, and immersed in, the worlds they create, he says. \"Animation is so free to create their own premise, have that premise elevate the story they want to tell,\" he explains. \"Because of that it's so easy to disarm myself and let the story take me over.\" Overall, two types of emotional storylines kept cropping up in fans' replies, he says. \"One is crying over a character dying, either because they've grown so emotionally attached to that character and it's heartbreaking, or they'll share a personal story about how they lost someone close to them,\" he says. One user got in touch to tell him he was particularly moved by Coco because his own grandmother had recently died. (The grandmother in Coco is pivotal to that film's emotional punch.) \"The other common trait I saw were films that were based on real history,\" Lee says. \"You had Schindler's List, Life Is Beautiful, Sophie's Choice, Saving Private Ryan, Grave of the Fireflies\u2026 \"There are a lot of historical films that show the darkest chapters of human history [and] that really gets to people. \"And when it comes to the darkest chapters of human history, that's when you see the worst of humanity but you also see the best of humanity, so it's both devastating but really moving as well. You're not quite sure if you're crying sad tears or happy tears.\" Many of the films unsurprisingly involve (spoiler alert) death or departures in one form or another. The other top picks ranged from female-led 1980s dramas Terms of Endearment, Beaches and Steel Magnolias to 2019's Avengers: Endgame, which had its fair share of gut-wrenching moments between the superhero action. Lee believes his original tweet touched such a nerve partly because of the current coronavirus lockdown. \"My only theory is I touched on the zeitgeist of how everyone's feeling at the moment,\" he reflects. \"Everyone is way more isolated now, and there are a lot of folks out there who are alone in this lockdown. \"Perhaps this thread got a lot of people to want to just reach out and connect with others, and the current atmosphere has allowed people to open up with more personal stuff.\" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "text": "Zohra Khaku is on the frontline of the fight against coronavirus. But rather than working on a ward, or delivering food, she and her staff are on the end of a phone line. She runs the Muslim Youth Helpline, which offers counselling for young Muslims in the UK. She's one of many people in this country dealing with the overwhelming effect the virus has had on Black and Asian communities. In a report released on Tuesday, Public Health England (PHE) acknowledged the disproportionate effect the pandemic has had on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (Bame) people, including making us more likely to become critically ill, and to die. Black people are almost four times more likely to die of Covid-19, according to the Office of National Statistics, while Asians are up to twice as likely to die. Over the past few months, outreach workers like Zohra have been helping those affected by Covid-19 in our communities. The effects have been brutal - not just physical, but psychological, societal and financial. And they hint at why our communities were so vulnerable to the pandemic in the first place. Zohra says they've had a more than 300% increase in calls, web chats and emails from distressed teens and young adults since the virus arrived in the UK - including a spike on Eid weekend. The virus, she tells me, has led to many young people becoming isolated - including those who'd never had mental health issues before - while others are struggling with bereavement and grief, after suddenly losing parents and other loved ones. \"We've been going for 19 years, but we've never been as busy as this,\" she says. The helpline has had calls from young Muslims with mental health conditions, for whom Friday prayers was their only lifeline to the outside world, providing them with a vital support system and connection to their community. \"People's support systems were taken away,\" she says. \"Because we've had Ramadan in lockdown, and people not able to go to Friday prayers, people who had depression or were isolated or lonely before all of this happened - whose only thing they would do with other human beings was once a week on a Friday - they suddenly don't have that any more either.\" Please enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   Here are only some of those who have died. To see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours. One call that sticks in her mind was from a 17-year-old girl whose parents had both been taken to hospital with Covid-19. \"Because her parents were in hospital she was looking after a 19-year-old sibling who was self-isolating, and a younger sibling who was severely disabled,\" Zohra says. \"Issue one was, 'I don't have any money left, please can you point me in the direction of a food bank because I need to be making food for my siblings.' The second thing was that she was doing her A-levels and applying for university, and this was at a time when we weren't sure what was happening with grades. She said that if one teacher in particular ends up giving her a predicted grade instead of her doing an exam, then she doesn't think she's going to get into the university she wants, because she doesn't think her teacher believes in her and is a little bit racist. So she's worried about her future. \"And the third thing was, the doctor from the ward that her mum's in called her just before she called us, and said, 'we don't think your mum's going to make it'. This girl said to us, 'the next phone call I'm expecting is to say that she's died. How do I make sure she has a Muslim burial? I'm only 17, I don't know how to do that.' \"That's just one case, and yet it's so complex. She was on nobody's radar, and if she hadn't reached out for help she'd still be in that situation on her own.\" The outbreak's impact on ethnic minorities' mental health has been devastating. The Muslim Youth Helpline, Zohra says, has seen a worrying increase in calls from people saying they're considering suicide. \"We usually get one call about suicide every two weeks, but we get them every night now,\" Zohra says. \"We had one day last week where half of our enquiries were about suicide, and there have been about three or four every night this week.\" The PHE report reveals that people living in the most deprived areas of the country are twice as likely as those living in the least deprived areas to be diagnosed with and to die of Covid-19. People of Black, Asian and mixed ethnicities are all significantly more likely to live in the most deprived 10% of neighbourhoods, according to government statistics. Overcrowded households are linked to this deprivation, too. Overcrowding is significantly more prevalent in lower-income households than in wealthier ones - according to one study, it affects 7% of the poorest fifth of households, as opposed to 0.5% of those in the richest fifth. This poses additional challenges for Ursala Khan, who provides counselling specifically to Bame youths through her work at The What Centre in Dudley. Since the coronavirus outbreak began, privacy has become a huge issue, she says. Many of the teens she works with live with large families in small spaces, meaning they don't have enough privacy to talk on the phone or video-call about mental health. \"Although we do offer alternatives like online counselling or phone counselling, there are still concerns for people trying to access those,\" Ursala says. \"If someone lives in an over-crowded house, it's quite difficult for them to know if they'll have the privacy to speak to us about their mental health.\" According to the English Housing Survey, carried out between 2014 and 2017, 30% of Bangladeshi households, 16% of Pakistani households and 12% of Black households experienced overcrowding. This was compared with just 2% of white British households. South Asian families in the UK are also more likely than white families to live in multi-generational households, with up to three generations of the same family living together. This means that school-age children may be living with their grandparents - something outreach workers have said most iterations of the government's guidance haven't taken into account. Because of this, many of the teens The What Centre works with are scared of going back to school. \"I see a lot of young people concerned about returning to school or college, especially if they live with elderly family members or family members who have pre-existing health conditions,\" Ursala says. Some people have been told to go into work when they haven't felt comfortable, too. Zohra gives the example of a young man who called the helpline after losing his job, after refusing to go into an office he deemed unsafe. \"We had a few cases of people saying 'I'm not sure if it's safe to go to work, but my employer's making me', and even before the lockdown we had calls about things like PPE,\" she says. \"Early on in the outbreak, there was one guy who said he got fired for refusing to go in\u2026 but he wrote in a few weeks later and told us: 'You know what, I have no job, but at least I'm alive - and I believe that if I'd continued going into work I wouldn't be'.\" The risk is partly because of the kind of work that many Black and Asian people in the UK do. South Asians are significantly more likely to work in the NHS, for example. In England nearly 21% of NHS staff are from ethnic minority backgrounds, but they only make up about 14% of the general population. At the same time, Black and Asian people are also more likely to be in insecure work - such as gig economy jobs, bogus self-employment and zero-hours contracts - than white people with the same qualifications. Many of these jobs, such as delivery drivers, taxi drivers and supermarket work, are now considered \"essential\". Research from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work. A report released last month by Carnegie UK Trust, UCL and Operation Black Vote also found that Bame millennials in particular were 47% more likely to be on notoriously unstable \"zero-hours\" contracts. Because of this, Black and Asian people are disproportionately more likely to have been \"key workers\" in front-line jobs during this pandemic - whether that's caring for patients on a Covid ward, or delivering takeaways. Rajesh Jayaseelan, for example, was an Uber driver in London who died of coronavirus in April. Days before he died, he was evicted from his home and forced to sleep in his car because his landlord had deemed him high-risk, on account of his job. Healthcare workers have also highlighted racism and workplace discrimination as major issues during the pandemic. Last month, Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust's head of equality Carol Cooper told the Nursing Times that Black and Asian nurses felt they were being \"targeted\" for work on Covid wards - more so than their white colleagues. \"They feel that there is a bias,\" she told the publication. \"The same bias that existed before, they are feeling is now influencing their being appointed - and they are terrified. Everybody is terrified.\" In another survey last month, carried out by ITV News, about 50% of doctors and healthcare staff who responded explicitly blamed \"systemic discrimination\" at work for the disproportionate number of deaths among Bame NHS staff. One in five healthcare workers said they had personally experienced racism - in response, NHS England said protecting staff was its \"top priority\" and that it had asked trusts to risk-assess Bame workers. So for now it's impossible to pin down whether the higher death rate among Bame people is down to sociology or biology, Michael Hamilton from Ubele, a social enterprise working with Britain's African diaspora, tells me. According to PHE, this is \"complex\" - but in essence, it's both. Socio-economic inequality means we're more likely to catch the virus, while our biology means we're more likely to die. Ubele has set up a fund to help people hold memorial services for their loved ones after the crisis. It is also leading the call for a full independent, non-governmental inquiry into the deaths of Black and ethnic minority people of coronavirus. So what, in Michael's opinion, is causing us to die at higher rates than our white British counterparts? \"Clearly there are multiple reasons, and I think I am personally, genuinely in a place to say at this point that I don't know,\" Michael says - adding that jumping to conclusions without all of the information is \"the worst thing we can do\". \"I think people are going to find different answers depending on their own speciality,\" he says. \"We might find that there is some biology. The socio-economic stuff, that's my bread and butter, so I can recite that. But I want to keep looking, because I genuinely don't know - but I believe that we do have to know.\" Dr Enam Haque is a GP in Manchester, but he also works with two Bame outreach groups - one that aims to educate patients, and another that works with Bame healthcare workers. He says he and his Bame colleagues have been \"terrified\" of the virus. \"It's quite scary as a GP from a Bangladeshi background myself, when I've seen Bame colleagues dying disproportionately,\" he tells me. The virus is very close to home for him - his uncle, Dr Moyeen Uddin, was a cardiologist in the city of Sylhet in Bangladesh, and was the first doctor in his country to die of Covid-19. It's affecting his patients, too: \"Many of our patients are staying away and not contacting us with health issues. My fear is that a lot of chronic conditions, lots of worrying conditions are not being diagnosed because people are scared - particularly, I've observed, from the ethnic minority population - that any kind of access to healthcare will make them exposed to Covid-19.\" Scientists have been looking into whether certain pre-existing medical conditions could be playing a part. Black and South Asian people are significantly more likely than white people to have Type 2 diabetes and hypertension (that is, high blood pressure), two conditions known to be high-risk. The PHE report reveals that the proportion of both Black and Asian people who've died of Covid-19 with diabetes was higher than white patients. As well as these two conditions, a recent study from Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge has found a link between lower levels of vitamin D and higher Covid-19 mortality rates in 20 European countries. Vitamin D deficiency is particularly common among Black and Asian people in the UK and other countries with limited sunshine. I ask Dr Haque what, in his opinion, could be the reason we're so much more likely to become critically ill, or even die. He tells me that although there are medical reasons for people from Bame backgrounds to be more vulnerable, biology doesn't explain everything. \"It's a fact that people from Bame backgrounds, particularly from South Asia, are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure, all of which make them more at-risk,\" he says. \"But the bigger issue, in my opinion, are the social determinants of health.\" By this, he means the economic and social conditions that make some people more vulnerable to health conditions - in this case, to becoming critically ill from a deadly virus - than others. \"There's something that has disadvantaged our population and has put us at risk,\" Dr Haque continues. \"It's the inequality in society - there's so much more deprivation, people in our communities earn lower wages, and we have more people working in frontline jobs as well. \"As well as healthcare workers we have a lot of bus drivers, taxi drivers\u2026 they may not have access to PPE in these jobs either, so they're putting themselves at risk while serving the community. That's a major factor right there.\" The problem, Michael Hamilton from Ubele says, is the people we're relying on the most in this pandemic are the ones who are the most exposed - and yet, by virtue of being considered \"low-skilled\", they are rendered invisible. \"I think one of the things we have to do - the biggest lesson I think we have to take from this - is to look at what we value, and who we value, and how we show them value,\" Michael says. \"It's our ability to not value certain types of people that has allowed this to happen.\""

        "text": "Last night he held a Bible in front of St John's Episcopal Church, just across the road from the White House. Today, he'll visit the Shrine to St John Paul II, also in Washington DC. But US President Donald Trump's signalling of religious affiliation has not been welcomed by a range of clerics as the nation struggles to manage the twin challenges of a pandemic and widespread political protest. The Episcopal Bishop of Washington, the Right Reverend Mariann Budde, said: \"The president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus.\" James Martin, a Jesuit priest and consultant to the Vatican's communications department, tweeted: \"Let me be clear. This is revolting. The Bible is not a prop. A church is not a photo op. Religion is not a political tool. God is not your plaything.\" Let me be clear. This is revolting. The Bible is not a prop. A church is not a photo op. Religion is not a political tool. God is not your plaything. pic.twitter.com/RZwPeqrwoZ End of Twitter post  by @JamesMartinSJ Rabbi Jack Moline, President of the Interfaith Alliance, said: \"Seeing President Trump standing in front of St John's Episcopal Church while holding a Bible in response to calls for racial justice - right after using military force to clear peaceful protesters - is one of the most flagrant misuses of religion that I have ever seen.\" President Trump does not belong to a particular congregation, only occasionally attends a service and has said many times that he does not like to ask God for forgiveness. But while he may not consider church essential to his personal life, it may yet hold the keys to his political future. In 2016, Mr Trump won 81% of white evangelical votes and exit polls found that white Catholics supported him over Hillary Clinton by 60% to 37%. Mr Trump's status, as the champion of evangelical and conservative voters, can seem peculiar given his use of divisive rhetoric, his three marriages, accusations of sexual assault by dozens of women, the hush-money paid to a pornographic film actress, and the record of false statements made during his presidency - more than 18,000 according to the Poynter Institute's Politifact website. But he has sealed a powerful bond with religious voters by embracing their political priorities and appointing two Supreme Court justices - Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch - and federal judges with their support. This may explain why - though an irregular congregant himself - the president has repeatedly demanded the reopening of churches, saying, on 22 May, \"If they don't do it, I will override the governors.\" Religious conservatives appear to be the most solid core of Mr Trump's voter base, despite political unrest and the vast number of deaths from Covid-19. According to the latest Pew Research Poll, 75% of white evangelical Protestants say he's doing a good job in handling the pandemic - down 6 percentage points from six weeks before. But while one voting bloc remains faithful, the country at large is deeply divided. According to analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight, which collates all polling data, 43% of Americans agree with the president's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, while 53.4% disapprove. Several religious leaders are hoping that Trump's visit to the shrine may encourage him to reflect on the words of then Pope John Paul II, delivered to the United Nations in 1995. \"The answer to the fear which darkens human existence at the end of the 20th Century,\" he said, \"is the common effort to build the civilization of love.\""

        "text": "Protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis have spread across the US and to other countries. They've been documented in videos, images and posts on social media. But some of these aren't what they claim to be. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been tracking misleading videos and conspiracy theories about the protests, which have been circulating online. So, here's what to look out for - and avoid - on your social media feeds. Rumours that the protests have been set up with potential projectiles handed out to agitators have gained traction, with thousands of posts referencing \"bricks\" on social media. Several videos that show piles of bricks along with claims that they were planted by police or the government have been watched by millions of people. Other posts pin the blame on Antifa - the left-wing group President Trump has accused of promoting the disturbances. However, there's no evidence so far to suggest foul play, nor that the protests have been somehow pre-planned. Most of the videos and images we've seen don't look particularly suspicious - it's not uncommon to see piles of bricks near building sites. Responding to a video suggesting bricks had been placed to escalate protests, San Francisco police said on Twitter \"pallets are affiliated with a construction site and (we) have contacted the contractor to have them removed.\" One Police Department in Boston hit back at misleading claims about a viral video of its officers unloading bricks from a van. Suggestions had been made on social media that the officers were unloading bricks from a vehicle \"to use them as an excuse\" against protesters. However, Boston's Northeastern University Police Department has tweeted that the officers had collected them \"from a damaged brick sidewalk\" and taken them back to the station as they were posing a safety hazard to pedestrians. Another viral video from Fayetteville, North Carolina that has racked up over a million views shows a pile of bricks in the vicinity of protests as a man says there is \"no construction\" site in the area. We've been able to geolocate the video and found images from 24 May with the same pile of bricks in the same place, long before any protests took place. In other cases, old images of piles of bricks have been re-shared of previous demonstrations elsewhere, such as from the protests in Hong Kong last year. We've seen lots of examples of old video surfacing in recent days. Among many genuine videos of brutal arrests, one that went viral yesterday was not what it seemed. The dramatic video shows a man being arrested then released by police once they'd checked his ID. A post claiming the man in the video is an \"FBI agent\" has been viewed over 4 million times on Twitter. This claim was repeated on Facebook and Instagram by others sharing the video, where it racked up millions more views. In response, Rochester Minnesota Police Department put out a statement clarifying that the man is not a Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agent. The incident took place in June last year, when he was mistaken for a wanted man. The original post of the video on Instagram includes a caption which stated the video was from the year before, and contains no mention of the FBI. A video of a teenager being violently arrested by a US police officer has generated almost 10 million views in the last few days. But the incident happened back in April - in Rancho Cordova, a city in Northern California. This wasn't made clear in the latest post that has been retweeted more than 100,000 times. It also wrongly identifies the teenager as female. The clip attracted widespread criticism at the time. Meanwhile, there is footage from the current protests which has led to allegations of police brutality. Video from the US shows police using batons and tear gas on protesters and journalists seemingly unprovoked. This video claims to show a US police building on fire and was posted on 28 May. It's not only old - it's from 2015 - it was filmed in another country. It shows an explosion in the Chinese city of Tianjin. So, why are people sharing old videos? \"The videos may be compounding the anger they are feeling and could be driven by attempts to sow division or get clicks,\" says Marianna Spring, BBC Specialist Disinformation and Social Media reporter. Speculation about who's behind the protests have been circulating online. Some claims are unsubstantiated, others totally false. First up, posts that have gone viral about George Soros. Some influential right-wing figures have made unfounded claims that the Hungarian-American billionaire is \"funding\" the demonstrations. Supporters of QAnon - a conspiracy theory about a \"deep state\" secret coup against Donald Trump - have shared similar claims. More than a million posts and memes online have repeated allegations about Mr Soros paying agitators. Mr Soros, whose Open Society Foundations provide financial support to a number of civil society groups and progressive projects around the world, has been a bogeyman of some on the right for a long time. His organisation has responded to the latest posts, tweeting that \"Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest\". Claims have circulated online about Russia's involvement in the protests. Viral tweets with thousands of shares suggest that Russia was involved in George Floyd's death - as part of a military operation or an elaborate plot. There is no evidence to support these claims. This isn't to rule out the idea that Russia or other countries - either through state media outlets or networks of fake accounts - could be involved in stoking tensions online. Investigations into Russian interference during the 2016 US Presidential election revealed that Russia was involved in a misinformation campaign, infiltrating groups and pages run by US activists - and that included Black Lives Matter groups.

        "text": "As protests spread across the US, President Trump has threatened to send in the army to end the unrest. Mr Trump said he would send in the military if cities and states failed to solve the problem. But some state governors have said the government does not have the power to send in federal troops without the permission of the state authorities. In short, yes under certain circumstances. There are already thousands of troops deployed from the National Guard, which is the reserve force for the US Army. They're in more than 20 states across the US trying to quell protests, but these forces have been requested by the cities or states themselves. However, a US law passed in the 19th Century lays out circumstances when the government in Washington DC can intervene without state authorisation. The Insurrection Act says the approval of governors isn't required when the president determines the situation in a state makes it impossible to enforce US laws, or when citizens' rights are threatened. The law was passed in 1807 to allow the president to call out a militia to protect against \"hostile incursions of the Indians\" - and it was subsequently extended to allow for the use of the US military in domestic disturbances and to protect civil rights. Another law passed in 1878 requires congressional authorisation for domestic military use, but a legal expert told the BBC that the Insurrection Act was sufficient legal authority on its own for the president to deploy the army. It is widely accepted that the president would have legal grounds to employ the military without asking for approval from the states in the current circumstances. \"The key point\", says Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor, \"is that it is the president's determination to make; the governors do not have to request his help.\" According to the Congressional Research Service, the Insurrection Act has been used dozens of times in the past, although not for almost three decades. It was last invoked in 1992 by former US President George HW Bush during race riots in Los Angeles. The law was used throughout the 1950s and 60s during the civil rights era by three different presidents, including when there were objections from state governors. President Dwight Eisenhower faced objections when he used the law in 1957 to send US troops to Arkansas to control a protest at a school, where black and white children were being taught together. Since the end of the 1960s, the use of the law has been rare. Congress amended it in 2006 following Hurricane Katrina in an attempt to make military assistance more effective, but the amendment was repealed after state governors objected to it.

        "text": "As the UK stared down the barrel of a coronavirus epidemic in early March, the biggest fear was that hospitals would be swamped and incapacitated by a tsunami of patients. It happened in Wuhan and northern Italy. The NHS largely pulled through, but there were still times hospitals became overwhelmed. One of those was when a London hospital became suddenly engulfed with victims. On 19 March, night-shift staff at Northwick Park Hospital in north-west London awoke to discover their workplace was so overwhelmed with Covid patients that a critical incident had been declared. \"I saw it on the news and thought 'oh my goodness',\" said consultant Tariq Husain. \"I'd had messages from colleagues during the day saying it was getting really busy, we needed extra help, we've got such a volume of patients. \"It was that realisation that everything we feared was becoming reality. \"It was shocking and almost unbelievable that it was happening.\" Six weeks earlier, at the end of January, Brexit was the only story in town. Coronavirus was still a mystery disease silently circulating in China. Northwick Park, which specialises in tropical diseases, was soon asked by Public Health England to start screening people coming into the UK from Wuhan who were showing signs of coronavirus. The hospital's location makes it easy to access from Heathrow Airport - similar protocols were used during the Ebola outbreak five years earlier. By mid-February, the extent of the global spread of coronavirus was impossible to ignore. In Italy, the number of cases crept up slowly at first and then rapidly accelerated - a textbook epidemic curve. Northwick Park staff were watching the news from abroad closely. \"I love Italy and go to Italy several times a year - I had actually cancelled a holiday that we had booked for the end of March,\" head of facilities Yvonne Smith said. \"So taking a particular interest in that and seeing the pictures of the intensive care units there was quite sobering, and you knew you were going to have to prepare yourself for something like that.\" Yvonne, from Kent, looks after non-clinical roles within the hospital - security, cleaning, porters, patient transport and laundry workers all fall under her remit. \"It's been extremely challenging because it has been so new and you don't know what to expect. It was a challenge managing all those groups of staff I look after in terms of making them safe at work, but making them feel confident in the job roles that they had.\" Battle plans were drawn up in case Northwick Park experienced a similar onslaught to the one in northern Italy. A pod was placed outside the hospital and any patients showing symptoms of coronavirus were assessed there. A specialist from the infectious disease department would don full PPE and come to test them. Inside the hospital, training exercises and preparations were just as rigorous. Some day-to-day tasks had to be scaled back. \"We mapped out a patient coming in as a live scenario and how we would have to adapt,\" A&E nurse consultant John Ross said. \"Then we just trained and trained and trained for a good 10 or 12 days. So everything we did had to change because of the threat coming in with Covid.\" John, from Inverness, explained that initial precautions against the virus were focused on identifying those patients who had travelled from China, Iran or Italy. \"For us, it was changing every single day. Which part of the world they were from and how much risk they had. I think Italy was when we really had to focus and get even more prepared - we kept saying in our training sessions that it was not likely to happen, but let's get prepared.\" John knew that if a coronavirus wave was destined for the capital, the boroughs served by Northwick Park - Harrow, Brent and Ealing - would be likely to be hit hard. \"We saw what happened in Italy,\" John recalled. \"We know there is a very dense population here, we know the demographics, we know a lot of our patients have cardiac and respiratory problems - a lot of diabetes - so it was always at the back of our minds. \"You hope that it isn't going to happen but you have to be prepared for it.\" All of their intense training was about be put to the test. On 3 March, \"wash your hands\" was the mantra at the Downing Street briefing - although Prime Minister Boris Johnson explained he had been continuing to shake people's hands. It was on this day the government published a detailed coronavirus action plan. Ten miles from Downing Street, a patient turned up at Northwick Park who had just returned to London from Iran. \"We knew Covid was coming,\" said Dr Rachel Tennent, who specialises in respiratory medicine. \"It had been in the news since January and we were preparing around February. \"Then it hit us like a tonne of bricks. It hit us hard and fast - the epicentre of the outbreak in the UK.\" When a further two patients tested positive for coronavirus, the hospital triggered a set of rapid changes. Surgeons were obliged to give up space so patients could be assessed safely and the A&E department was divided up. \"I remember meeting up here on Sunday 8 March - how we are going to keep staff and patients safe?\" Rachel said. \"We decided to create different pathways, negative going to one area of the department and people with respiratory problems who might be positive to the other. \"We had to move a lot of wards and staff around - stuff that would usually take six months to a year happened in a week.\" The number of seriously ill patients being admitted to Northwick Park was increasing and, within days, staff found themselves dealing with a crisis. \"We had an exponential increase,\" Rachel said. \"On Monday 9 March we opened our respiratory assessment area wards and within two days those wards were full. \"Then on the third day another ward was opened and then we started cohorting patients with respiratory problems in side rooms. By the end of that second week we were up to a full ward and then another one full.\" Coronavirus was declared a global epidemic by the World Health Organisation on 11 March. The virus was by now spreading across London, and Public Health England's modelling suggested cases were doubling in the capital every five days. At Northwick Park, they were seeing the number of cases double every two days. \"It increased at a very, very rapid rate,\" Rachel explained, adding that new advice from China was that early intubation of patients was the way forward. Risks are attached to every intubation as the procedure projects the virus into the air, further exposing staff. At this point, 44-year-old consultant Tariq Hussain had a tough conversation with his family after he was asked to take a senior role in Northwick Park's critical care response to Covid-19. \"It wasn't an easy call to make. You end up sacrificing a lot of things,\" Tariq said, although he knew that taking on the role was the right thing to do. The gravity of the situation was by this stage clear, with confirmed infections in Harrow, Brent and nearby Ealing jumping from five to 112 in a week. \"We saw all kinds of patients - patients who have been admitted to ICU have been relatively fit and well, with a few diabetes, high blood pressure cases, but otherwise reasonably well,\" Tariq said. \"But certainly not just elderly; we had people in their 20s, 30s and upwards from there. \"There have been relatively few Caucasians and a high proportion of Asian patients, which is the cohort of people around here. \"Everyone had read the newspapers and seen the news about the scale of the pandemic, particularly in China. \"We never thought we'd quite reach the point of such a huge volume of patients requiring admission to intensive care.\" \"Patients would initially go into side rooms,\" head of facilities Yvonne Smith said. \"Every time a Covid patient vacated that room it would need a full clean. \"So our normal terminal cleans will average 20 or 25 a day. At our absolute peak that went up to 96 terminal cleans a day.\" Tariq described the surge of patients at this stage as a \"tidal wave\". It was about to crash down, as Northwick Park ran out of space for the sick. On 19 March, the prime minister said it would take 12 weeks to turn the tide against coronavirus. At the same time an executive meeting was being held at Northwick Park, where a critical incident was declared. \"We had a lot of patients and more coming in than we could match the demand of what we could actually do,\" head of nursing Trish Mukherjee said. As part of the critical incident protocol, patients were shuttled to other hospitals to alleviate the pressure. \"The whole point about the critical incident is for that help within the area,\" Dr Rachel Tennent said. \"You don't want people dying in a busy hospital when 30 miles up the road no-one has even got it, so the whole point is to share the access to ventilators.\" Northwick Park became the first UK hospital during the pandemic to declare such an incident - only Watford General has taken the same action, although Weston General also saw its resources pushed to the very limit. Medical director Dr Martin Kuper was one of those involved in the decision to declare an emergency at Northwick Park. \"I think it was right for us to do so,\" he said. \"We had an awful lot of patients and we needed some help here.\" To stem the flow of coronavirus cases, the UK was put into lockdown on 23 March. Restaurants, pubs and tourist hotspots emptied, while hospital beds and morgues continued to fill. At the peak of the crisis at Northwick Park, 126 patients in the hospital's NHS trust area died with coronavirus in one week - every one of them with no family present. \"Yes, the deaths were going up,\" head of nursing Trish Mukherjee said, \"but the most difficult part was that relatives weren't there and we had to stay with the patients and hold their hand and be there for their last moments - I think that was difficult in itself.\" Emma Leahy, a nurse from Limerick, has the task of using a tablet computer to connect patients with loved ones at home. \"We continue to care throughout all different parts of their stays in intensive care,\" she said. \"Seeing a patient who we have cared for a month to be able to wake up and say 'thank you for looking after me', and seeing their children say 'can't wait to see you, Dad' - this is why we do this job.\" One of the people Emma has nursed is Jal Makai, a father of four from Northolt, who was taken to Northwick Park on 3 April after collapsing on the toilet. In hospital, his condition worsened and within three days of being admitted he was hooked up to a ventilator. He spent a month on it. His kidneys failed and he was unable to walk or hear out of one ear. But Jal has survived. \"Without these guys at the NHS I'd be gone, very simple,\" he said. \"At one point my wife thought that was it, I was gone.\" He added: \"When you do open your eyes there is someone here. Always - maybe even more than one. They are angels. They put themselves in harm's way - they should be getting paid more than footballers. \"If it wasn't for them I wouldn't see my kids again, very simple.\" At about the same time Jal was admitted, NHS veteran of 35 years Chris Bown took over as CEO of the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust, which is responsible for Northwick Park. \"The striking thing for me is, having finished a job in the NHS as a CEO in mid-January, was that the NHS that I left in mid-January was not the NHS I returned to at the end of March,\" he said. \"It fundamentally had to shift and change to meet this devastating pandemic. \"I was really quite shocked to see the impact this was having but equally reassured that, despite the enormous pressures, the staff here in this trust were absolutely doing their utmost to manage very difficult circumstances with great compassion.\" Every survival story during the pandemic has provided a much-needed morale boost for staff - and they have even had one of their own. Nurse Alicia Borja spent a month in the hospital with coronavirus and was eventually applauded out of Northwick Park by the colleagues who helped save her. Alicia is recovering at home but will be back to help care for others with the virus that almost killed her. \"We've had 900 discharges of Covid patients and that is amazing,\" Trish said. \"It was lovely to see Alicia recover so well and to see her go home. \"I got to look after her, I got to speak with her, hold her hand and talk about normal things. \"Seeing her be applauded out was just an overwhelming joy.\" There is now relative calm at Northwick Park. Covid patients are still coming in but at nowhere near the volume experienced a few weeks ago. On the coronavirus ward, Emma Leahy takes a break from chatting with patients and families to reflect. \"The last few weeks have been emotional,\" she said. \"It has been a rollercoaster and it's made me realise we take things for granted - and it's something I won't be doing any more.\" \"Our work is being recognised,\" Emma added. \"I never really knew my neighbours, they didn't really know me.\" \"They didn't know I was a nurse and the last few weeks I've gotten to see my neighbours and we've clapped for carers every Thursday together and it has just brought this sense of community and the feeling that we are all in this together.\" \"North-west London is where the wave crashed in Covid and we were the hardest hit first,\" medical director Martin Kupar said. \"The reasons for that, our boroughs, Brent, Ealing and Harrow, have a high rate of Covid. \"We don't know why that is - it is certainly a diverse and multi-ethnic area and then there is a lot of travel as well. There are also socio-economic reasons.\" He said that patients numbers did not double again at Northwick Park after the critical incident was declared. More than two months on, staff now fear a second wave. \"We were the place that was hit first but it would have carried on - the lockdown was essential. Nothing else can help you reduce the numbers,\" he said. \"It seems likely that there will be upstrokes of waves as the lockdown is eased... the rate of increase is likely to be slower than the first time round, which is when there were no restrictions on people. \"I don't think we've had a similar crisis in my lifetime in the NHS and I think the staff have been amazing.\" End of Youtube post  by BBC London Many staff are being encouraged to take time off. \"Of course we are on standby in case anything increases,\" CEO Chris Bown said. \"But we are seeing that the numbers of admissions and deaths through Covid-19 have decreased substantially. \"Clearly, we are all learning a great deal from this and we always need to be prepared if there is going to be a second wave - which we really hope there isn't - but we are now making sure staff take as much annual leave and training as we are in a bit of a dip right now.\" It's now almost three months since the first confirmed coronavirus patient was admitted to the hospital. Even though the past few weeks have been traumatic, there is a sense of triumph in the unity, compassion and resilience shown by staff at Northwick Park."

        "text": "Over the weekend thousands of people chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" across the UK - at protests in London, Manchester and Cardiff. They were marching in support of protesters in America angered by the death of George Floyd on 25 May. He died nearly 4,000 miles away from the UK in Minnesota, but his death was felt here in our black community too. That's why people like Shayne defied UK government coronavirus guidance and went out to protest on the weekend. \"We didn't expect that many people to turn up at the protests, it was mad,\" the 20-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. \"The general vibe was electric because you could literally see that everybody was hurt.\" Shayne says she and her friends wore military boots to the London protest and were impressed to see lots of other women dressed like members of the Black Panther movement. \"There were a lot of black women with their natural hair out,\" she says. \"We wanted to show we're proud of who we are and that we shouldn't have to hide our blackness to stay alive.\" Shayne says although George Floyd was killed in the US, \"we know that it happens here too\", citing the case of Mark Duggan. He was a 29-year-old who was shot and killed in 2011 while police in London were trying to arrest him under suspicion of planning an attack and being in possession of a gun. His death sparked riots in London, where police officers are four times more likely to use force against black people than white people, and later across the UK. An inquest jury in 2014 found that Mark Duggan was lawfully killed. In 2016, ex-Aston Villa footballer Dalian Atkinson died when he was restrained by police and Tasered in Telford, Shropshire. Rasharn Charles died in hospital due to a cardiac arrest and obstructed airway during restraint from police officers in 2017. Last week a public inquiry was announced into the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody in Scotland in 2015. Protesters in London held signs bearing their names, and the names of other black people who have died after encounters with British police, at the weekend. \"It's just very frustrating, I'm very angry and very tired. To constantly be hearing about black people being aimlessly killed for no reason is draining,\" Shayne says. \"We have our issues within the black community but we are still very united. \"The prejudice that black people in America face is the same prejudice we face here. When one is hurt, we're all hurt, because it could have been us.\" In America, protests have led to violent clashes between protesters and police. The police officer who was seen with his knee on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes during his arrest for using a fake $20 note has been charged with murder. Eyram Kiakia, who's 20 and has a YouTube channel speaking about the UK Black Lives Matter movement, says she became more upset about the death of George Floyd the more she learned about his life. \"I watched a few seconds of when they were kneeling on his neck but I wasn't able to finish watching it, I was really upset,\" she tells Newsbeat. \"What upset me more was watching the videos of him as an activist and him being vocal about certain things in his community, they upset me more than the video of the police killing him.\" Eyram says people think the UK is more progressive on race than America, \"when actually it isn't\". The UK Home Office was accused of racism following the Windrush scandal - when black people who came to Britain as children were wrongly told they were here illegally and deported or threatened with deportation. \"Race clearly played a part in what occurred,\" the long-awaited review into what happened said earlier this year. The Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 and the Windrush scandal were mentioned by rapper Dave when he called Prime Minister Boris Johnson racist during a performance at the Brit Awards after winning album of the year - causing Home Secretary Priti Patel to defend the PM. Eyram says racism in the UK is institutionalised and also evident in schools - where Black Caribbean pupils are more likely to be excluded than White British pupils - and the workplace. \"There's a lot of more covert things that have happened to us and still happen to us, like when we were in school they policed black people's hair, we weren't allowed certain hairstyles or colours even though our white counterparts were able to dye their hair any colour,\" she says. \"In the workplace, there's always micro-aggressions. Everyone I know has experienced some sort of ignorant comment at the hands of a fellow employee or even an employer. \"Just because it's so subtle and it's not overt, it doesn't mean it's not racist.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

        "text": "Violence has erupted in cities across the US over the death of African-American George Floyd, after he was physically restrained by police in Minneapolis. We've looked at some of the data around crime and justice in the US, and what it shows about the experience of African-Americans when it comes to law and order. The figures that are available for incidents in which the police shoot and kill people show that for African-Americans, there's a much higher chance of being fatally shot relative to their overall numbers in the US population. In fact, in 2019, although African-Americans made up less than 14% of the population (according to official census figures), they accounted for more than 23% of the just over 1,000 fatal shootings by the police. And that figure has been relatively consistent since 2017, whereas the number of white victims has come down since then. African-Americans are arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use at similar levels. In 2018, around 750 out of every 100,000 African-Americans were arrested for drug abuse, compared to around 350 out of every 100,000 white Americans. Previous national surveys on drug use show that white people use drugs at similar rates, but African-Americans continue to get arrested at a higher rate. For example, a study by the American Civil Liberties Union found that African-Americans were 3.7 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites, even though their rate of marijuana usage was comparable. African-Americans are imprisoned at five times the rate of white Americans and at almost twice the rate of Hispanic-Americans, according to the latest data. In 2018, African-Americans made up around 13% of the US population, but represented almost a third of the country's prison population. White Americans made up around 30% of the prison population - despite representing more than 60% of the total US population. That's more than 1,000 African-American prisoners for every 100,000 African-Americans, compared to around 200 white inmates for every 100,000 white Americans. The US prison population is defined as inmates sentenced to more than a year in a federal or state prison. Imprisonment rates have dropped for African-Americans over the last decade, but they still make up more of the prison population than any other race.

        "text": "Across Europe, lockdown measures are being lifted cautiously, in phases. Businesses are reopening and many children are back in school. Here is how Europeans are emerging from life under lockdown. Germany has begun opening up: control of lifting the lockdown will now be in the hands of Germany's 16 federal states. But Chancellor Angela Merkel has stressed that an ''emergency brake'' will be applied anywhere that sees a surge in new infections. What did football's new reality look like? Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. Travel between regions and to and from the country will be allowed from 3 June. France's strict lockdown was imposed on 17 March, with residents required to provide a travel permit justifying any outdoor trips. Restrictions began to ease on 11 May, and phase two of the easing began on 2 June, including an end to a 100km (62-mile) travel limit: The three Baltic states - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - became the first countries in Europe to allow free movement again, but only with each other. From 15 May citizens and residents could move freely across the three countries, provided they had not travelled outside the Baltic states in the past two weeks, were not infected, and not in contact with an infected person. Those coming from elsewhere still have to self-isolate for 14 days. Estonia has since said several countries would not be affected by quarantine from 1 June, including Germany, France and Austria. Ireland has had a stricter lockdown than the UK, with residents only allowed to exercise within 2km (1.2 miles) of their homes. But a five-stage roadmap to reopen the country started on 18 May, with restrictions eased every three weeks. Restrictions are slowly being lifted in a country that has seen a high number of deaths in care homes. No public sporting or cultural events can take place before 30 June. The Netherlands imposed a far less strict lockdown than next-door Belgium. Prime Minister Mark Rutte unveiled a five-phase plan for easing lockdown restrictions, which kicked in from 11 May. Austria was one of the first countries to ease its lockdown. The health minister said the reopening of small shops in mid-April didn't cause a spike in cases. Denmark, one of the first European countries to announce a lockdown, started to ease restrictions in mid-April. Spain outlined a four-stage plan on 4 May to start easing one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, which saw children under 14 confined to their homes for six weeks. On 1 June Spain moved to a second phase for 70% of Spaniards, but Madrid, Barcelona and some other regions were remaining under tighter phase-one restrictions. The state of emergency is to end on 21 June, restoring freedom of movement. Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum became Spain's first large museum to reopen its doors, though in all cases 50% capacity is the maximum allowed. Switzerland began easing its eight-week lockdown in stages from 27 April. Portugal has had fewer coronavirus cases and deaths than some other south European nations. The government announced a three-phase plan, reopening different sectors of the economy every 15 days. Greece recorded its first Covid-19 case on 26 February and the government acted swiftly to impose a lockdown. On 28 April, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced a relaxation of lockdown measures in the weeks ahead. President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia's nationwide lockdown was being eased from 12 May, and that businesses could go back to work to stop unemployment rising further. He also said it was up to individual regions to decide the best policy. But Russia's daily infection rate remains high, compared with the rest of Europe. In Poland, Covid-19 numbers are lower than in many Western European countries. Most of the recent infections have been amongst the country's coal miners in the southern Silesia region. Poland began lifting restrictions on 20 April, when parks and forests were allowed to reopen. There was no compulsory lockdown in Sweden, unlike the measures seen elsewhere in Europe. But in line with government advice, most people took to voluntary social distancing and working from home."

        "text": "When travel start-up Pana held a meeting for all of its employees over Zoom, they explained that some staff would be laid off, and that there would be two further calls that morning - one at 09:00 for those who would be laid off, and one at 09:45 for those who would not. Employees would know which meeting they were attending by the invites they would have received by email. Sales executive Ruthie Townsend was invited to join the 09:00 call but, due to the shock of the news, she could not remember which call was for those about to be laid off, and which was for those being retained. \"Because it was such a highly stressful situation, it was hard to process what was going on so I got mixed up. I joined the 09:00 call as that was the invite I had, and once I realised that I was being laid off, I quickly turned off my video,\" she says. Ms Townsend was on the call with 15 of her colleagues, and executives from the company then walked these employees through the benefits, the severance package and the next steps. The company, based in Denver, Colorado, had been hit by the collapse in travel due to the coronavirus outbreak. But there had been a feeling that redundancies would be a last resort, and Ms Townsend had no idea what was coming that morning. That kind of shock is unfortunately commonplace at the moment, as companies are slashing staff numbers to cope with the economic fallout from the coronavirus. Before the crisis managers would usually have met staff face-to-face, to give them the bad news. Now video-conferencing tools, such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams (MS Teams), are being used to replicate the formality of the meeting. Chris Malone, an audio visual technician at events company Sparq in the UK, feared for his role when it was explained to him that a HR representative would be on his next MS Teams call along with his line manager. His instincts proved correct, as he was told he was going to be laid off. For him, the use of a video call made the meeting formal, but more awkward than an in-person meeting or telephone call. \"I think if you were doing it over the phone, it would mean you don't have to look at someone but when you have the video call, you get dressed up to make it feel formal and to look presentable. \"Even though it is a video call, the pressure is there - and as you're not in the room with them there isn't a natural chemistry, connection or body language you can read off, and there's a little bit of a delay, you're waiting for someone else to say something,\" he says. However, Mr Malone believes that a one-to-one video call is still the best way a business can break the unfortunate news to an employee in the current circumstances. For Ms Townsend, there were pros and cons to having more than 15 people on the same call as her. \"I don't think any way of making someone redundant over video conference is going to be ideal. If it's one-on-one, it's still going to be really hard and then your boss is going to see all of your emotions. I liked the group setting because I turned off my video, and I didn't have to say anything,\" she says. However, she believes that the group setting prevented her from asking important questions at the time. More Technology of Business Sarah Evans, partner at law firm JMW, explains that communication prior to any announcement is key for employers. \"What many big businesses can do is conduct large meetings on Zoom, to make an announcement to the same people at the same time, so there's no miscommunication going around,\" she says. This would make it clear that redundancies or the furlough scheme are being considered for employees, and would also make clear what this means for the business, and how they intend to follow-up with individuals. It is key for employers to provide employees with time to absorb the information, ask questions and give people the opportunity to voluntarily be made redundant or furloughed. \"In redundancy cases, that would be at least a couple of meetings to go through opportunities to avoid redundancy and consider alternatives, and there's no reason why all of this can't be done on Zoom,\" she says. The use of video, phone call or in-person, is not a legal matter; it's merely a matter of etiquette. However, the group call, which Ruthie Townsend had experienced in the US, would not be allowed in the UK. \"That wouldn't cut it in UK law, as you have a right to individual consultation. There's nothing wrong with a group call to announce potential redundancies but you shouldn't be making people redundant in the same video call,\" Ms Evans says. If this were the way a UK employer had acted, the employee might then have a case for unfair dismissal. The option to record video calls could also prove problematic in these cases. Peter Binning, a partner at law firm Corker Binning, explains that, generally speaking, anyone should ask for consent before recording a call of any kind. However, regardless of whether consent was asked for, given or not given, a recorded conversation could still be admissible in an unfair dismissal case. \"Whoever wants to use the evidence has to be able to prove that it had been properly recorded and was genuine but it would be a matter for the court or tribunal to decide whether that evidence should be admitted,\" Mr Binning says. And those wanting to snoop on people by deliberately joining a Zoom call where someone else is being made redundant would most definitely be breaking the law - as there are a number of criminal offences about intercepting communications in the regulations. While video may create new problems, it is the best replacement for a meeting in person. \"It will feel more uncomfortable to look someone in the eye, and the level of emotional frustration and anger will be more visible, but it is essential to delivering the message in an open, fair and transparent way to another person,\" says Stuart Duff, an expert on the psychology of leadership at business psychology consultancy Pearn Kandola."

        "text": "A woman lifts the weights over her head one last time then drops them to ground with a grunt of exhaustion, turning her head towards the slight breeze coming in from the open door. This ladies-only gym in D\u00fcsseldorf has just reopened. Life in Germany is beginning to look a little like it did before coronavirus silenced its beer gardens, grounded its aircraft and brought production lines to a standstill. Schools, businesses, restaurants, shops and churches have either reopened or are about to - with strict social distancing measures. There's even the promise of summer holidays elsewhere in Europe. But Britta, who's just finished her workout, is unsure about easing restrictions. \"I'm torn,\" she said. \"I enjoy the new freedoms but at the same time I'm rather scared, maybe it was too early. I think people need to be careful still and mustn't be careless.\" Germany's calm and successful handling of the pandemic attracted international attention. But its next moves have been chaotic, characterised by squabbling between regional leaders which has culminated in a faster lifting of restrictions than Chancellor Angela Merkel would have liked. The leaders of Germany's 16 states have the power to decide how and when they do that. Unable to agree a common strategy, they've instituted a patchwork of rules and regulations, with people in one state able to, for example, use the gym again, while in another region, fitness centres have remained closed. It's fuelled an intense public debate about the \"Lockerung\" or relaxation policy, with many fearing that Germany could squander its initial success. \"It's too soon, we're easing up too fast and too much and we risk a second wave,\" said Professor Frank Montgomery, who chairs the World Medical Association. Professor Montgomery speaks for many when he says that there's been \"a beauty contest\" from the premiers of the different German states  which \"risks all that we have achieved\". In the warmth of the early evening sun, cyclists glide around couples and families strolling along D\u00fcsseldorf's riverfront. Under a pavement table, a dog opens a lazy eye as a waiter brings beer and wine to cheerful customers. As yet, there's been no significantly adverse effect (beyond a couple of outbreaks linked to churches and slaughterhouses) on Germany's infection figures. But, with newly reopened shops and restaurants reporting that customers are cautious and slow to return, it may be too soon to tell. Surveys suggest that the German public were accepting of the restrictions, that they approved of Angela Merkel's cautious approach, despite the terrible impact on the country's economy. So why have some regional politicians been so enthusiastic to open up society again? Some appear to have been spooked by recent street protests against the measures, perhaps remembering how the small grassroots protest movement Pegida grew into a full-on backlash against Mrs Merkel's refugee policy and seats in parliament for the far-right party Alternative for Germany (AfD). The anti-lockdown movement - which appears to be dwindling - has brought together left and right wing extremists, conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers, and could hardly be said to represent the general population. But many suspect there's another reason for that so-called beauty contest. Angela Merkel is due to stand down next year after four terms in office. The race to succeed her was well under way but the coronavirus crisis has transformed political and public life and, with it, the chances of those with ambitions to the Chancellery. Some, like the businessman Friedrich Merz, have all but disappeared from the spotlight while others, like the country's health minister Jens Spahn or Bavaria's premier, Markus S\u00f6der - who grabbed headlines by announcing the first lockdown in his state - are being talked about as possible chancellors in waiting. Armin Laschet, whose office overlooks the D\u00fcsseldorf waterfront, has been one of the most voluble agitators for a swift relaxation of coronavirus restrictions. The premier of North Rhine-Westphalia - and one of the leading chancellor candidates - denies that his approach has anything to do with trying to maintain a high profile through the crisis. \"The measures we had to decide now are so important - a matter of life and death - you couldn't act on a tactical basis,\" he said. \"Among the population it was much more popular to close everything down but I thought that was wrong\u2026I acted out of a basic sense of responsibility to this state.\" He's a cheerful chap who enthusiastically jabs a finger at official charts showing the downward trend in infection rates. Mr Laschet says it's best that every region, with their differing economies, geographies and infections, should act independently. \"We have the health problem of the pandemic, the infection, disease, but there are other damages,\" he said. \"For children from disadvantaged backgrounds: If they can't go to school for 10 weeks they lose chances. Sick people who didn't have Covid-19 didn't get treatment because the hospitals were reserved for Covid-19. People in care homes got lonely, lost the will to live.\" \"These are damages too and they claimed lives. It's why I always thought you have to consider both sides of the story, not just the virological one,\" he said. Not far away, in a tent outside a care home, I sit opposite Katharina Resch. A perspex screen divides us but it means we can talk safely, face to face. The relaxation has meant her family has now been able to visit the pensioner. But the staff worry. They've kept the virus out but fear the impact of a second lockdown on their residents if general infection levels rise. Katharina's concerned, likening the rush to lift restrictions to upending a sack of potatoes. \"I'm sceptical that this head over heels [approach] is a good thing,\" he said. \"But I think politicians are so under pressure that they have to do something.\" A care worker wheels Katharine back into the home and she waves goodbye. Germany may have got its outbreak under control for now but scientists and politicians are watching anxiously. It is, as Angela Merkel has repeatedly acknowledged, a fragile success."

        "text": "Swimmers may have to arrive in their costumes and the number of people in lanes be limited when pools reopen, to allow for social distancing. For the time being indoor and outdoor pools must remain shut, despite the easing of some lockdown restrictions, It's thought chlorine in swimming pools will kill coronavirus but Swim England has warned a \"stricter regime\" will still be needed when they do reopen. The body has warned 500 pools in England could close permanently. Pools in England cannot reopen before 4 July under the government's current plan for lifting lockdown restrictions and the advice also says people should not swim at the beach without a lifeguard present. In Scotland, indoor leisure facilities will not be able to open until the country moves to phase three of its plan for easing the lockdown and they will be subject to physical distancing and hygiene measures. A provisional date for reopening pools is also yet to be given in Wales and Northern Ireland, where indoor leisure centres will remain closed until step four of its lockdown plan. But as the weather has warmed up, people have headed to beaches, with three people seriously injured while jumping off a cliff into the sea at Durdle Door in Dorset on Saturday. In London, the Serpentine Lido in Hyde Park was forced to close after attempting to reopen last week because it became too crowded. Chlorinated water should kill the virus, but preventing it from spreading in changing rooms and other areas around pools remains a concern. Swim England chief executive Jane Nickerson said guidance was still being finalised but that people might be asked not to use changing rooms, and pools could be told to limit how many people could be in the water at a time. She told The Times people might have to arrive \"beach ready\" in their costumes. Olympic gold-medallist Duncan Goodhew, who is president of the Swimathon charity, told Radio 4's Today programme there were 5,000 public pools in England, 10% of which might not be able to reopen with social-distancing measures as they were \"old, inefficient and expensive to run\". He said: \"A little like a restaurant, it becomes very difficult economically to make it work because you're just not getting the volume of people through.\" Swim England has called for financial support from the government to help ensure pools are financially viable as the lockdown eases. Ms Nickerson said: \"We know there will be major financial challenges for pool operators, all of whom saw their income disappear overnight, and who will be faced with the dilemma of opening pools against the backdrop of less footfall and increased environmental costs.\" Mr Goodhew, who won gold at 100m breaststroke in Moscow in 1980, added: \"It's really important the pools open because there are many, many people out there, some people who are disabled or have bad hips, etc, who cannot do any other exercise. \"From a point of view of quality of life, we've got to get them open.\" Thea Paraskevaides, 33, is one of those who is desperate to get back in the pool. She started swimming 18 months ago after a bad ankle injury and relies on the activity as her main form of exercise. \"Aside from the fitness element, it's really important for mental health,\" she said. \"For me I feel like I need that exercise to help my wellbeing, especially now at such a difficult time.\" While she feels confident she would be able to maintain social distancing while swimming, Thea said she would still have some concerns about hygiene around the pool. \"I would have to take hand sanitiser and wipes and clean everything before I touched it,\" she added. Louise Zecevic, who used to swim regularly with her children before the lockdown, said she would be happy to put up with any restrictions needed when pools are allowed to reopen. \"If numbers were restricted I would accept that and it might make the swimming experience more pleasant in some ways as the pools near me in London can be massively overcrowded,\" the 39-year-old said. \"We all love swimming and my kids are constantly asking when we can go back to the pool. \"We've had a paddling pool in the back garden but it's not an activity you can really replicate.\" Prof Keith Neal, emeritus professor of epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said chlorine was \"very easily able to inactivate most viruses including Covid-19\", but \"the main problem will be the social distancing, mostly the changing rooms\". Swim England is working with Public Health England on advice for pools reopening, which will be published on 15 June. Among the issues which will be covered are water treatment, air circulation and social distancing. The Swimming Teachers' Association is also liaising with the government on measures for after the lockdown. Chief executive Dave Candler said there was no \"one-size fits all\" answer to personal hygiene and social distancing measures for the industry - which would \"most likely mean smaller classes in the interim\"."

        "text": "Some of Europe's best known art museums are reopening after closing in March for the Covid-19 pandemic but it will be far from business as usual. For most of these museums and galleries, it will be a matter of limiting visitor numbers, intensifying cleaning procedures and insisting all tickets be bought online in advance. Normally at this time of year Amsterdam's huge and world-famous Rijksmuseum would have up to 12,000 visitors daily. From this week that number will be strictly limited to 2,000 a day. But after weeks of unwanted closure the museum's director Taco Dibbits is delighted to be reopening even on a limited scale. Several major public galleries around Europe have decided the arrival of June is the right time if not to fling open the doors at least to open them very carefully. Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum and the Rembrandt House also reopen this week. Dibbits says the decision to open Dutch museums is a matter of government policy. \"But I think we all felt this was the time to give the people of the Netherlands their museums back, which are so much loved. The Rijksmuseum is open with our normal hours although I think for now there will not be many tourists. \"Every case is different, not just in the Netherlands, and we all have to find our own way to provide a safe experience for visitors. I think almost all museums will insist visitors buy a ticket in advance and keep to the slot they are given online. \"But once you are in our museum you are able to roam free and we are deliberately keeping our visitors to about 20% of what they would normally be. You still have to keep 1.5 metres from other people but we wanted to make the experience of the museum as normal as possible.\" Among other important venues reopening this week is the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim Bilbao in northern Spain. It too has been shut since the middle of March. Initially it will only open from 2pm most days but it's coordinating with the city's Fine Arts Museum which will be open when the Guggenheim is closed. Its older but much smaller cousin, the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice is also open again from this week. And in Rome one of Europe's great cultural glories is viewable by tourists once more - the Sistine Chapel, whose ceiling was painted by Michelangelo from 1508. For now visitors will need a face mask and will have their temperature taken when they enter the Vatican Museums. The Vatican authorities say there be will health workers on hand to help. One of Europe's most gorgeously located galleries of modern art is Denmark's Louisiana Museum on the coast an hour from Copenhagen, looking across the water to Sweden. It reopened on Friday. It benefits from an outside sculpture park, as well as the displays inside and was reopened last week by the Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Like virtually all the museums which reopen this week it wants people to book ahead online. But Jan Hybertz Goricke of the museum says visitor numbers are generally about 2,500. \"So we will try to get people in even if they haven't pre-booked. I think all the museums which have reopened are going to find a way through the first weeks, trying to ensure visitors have an experience as good as possible.\" The Louvre in Paris, possibly the world's most famous art museum, remains closed but it's scheduled to open on 6 July. The Louvre Lens, in eastern France, starts to reopen from this week. All these changes are provisional: if Covid-19 starts to peak again it's possible some or all of these re-openings could be reversed. And in many places it will remain hard or impossible to visit these museums without pre-booking for months to come. But this week art galleries and museums in certain European countries have something to celebrate at last. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

        "text": "Early in the Covid-19 outbreak, the Shetland Islands were one of the worst-hit areas of the UK by head of population. Now, no new cases have been detected there for six weeks. Some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown - but for the first family on the islands to test positive, it hasn't been easy. It was a clear, bright Tuesday in early March when the plane began its descent. The Shetland archipelago stretched out ahead of the tiny twin-propeller aircraft. Iain Malcolmson looked through his passenger-seat window at the sprawl of islands, aware of how far north he'd just travelled. Iain, 53, an architect, was on his way home. He and his wife, Suzanne, had spent a long weekend in the Italian city of Naples with four friends. They'd hesitated before setting off on 28 February - news bulletins were full of alarming footage of the Covid-19 cluster in Lombardy, 500 miles to the north of where they were staying. But official travel advice at that point was clear - it was safe to visit the south of the country - so they'd gone as planned. All the same, Iain recalled spending the trip fastidiously wiping down restaurant tables and washing his hands. Now, after an overnight stop in Edinburgh, Iain would soon be back at the house in the tiny settlement of Nesting, about 12 miles north of the islands' capital, Lerwick. Locals call this leg of the journey the \"white-knuckle express\"; in strong winds, the plane has to take off and land at Sumburgh Airport sideways, like a crab. Normally, Iain preferred the 14-hour overnight ferry from Aberdeen. But on this occasion everything seemed calm. During the first week of March 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic that had raged out of Wuhan still seemed far away. Here in the tiny aeroplane, Scotland's mainland was 110 miles to the south, Norway was 190 miles to the east. It was still possible to conceive that Shetland might be spared. \"You have to understand what Shetland is like,\" says Iain. \"We're pretty isolated, and I think most people thought it would be something that would happen to other people. It wouldn't have come to Shetland.\" Then, two days after he landed, on the evening of Thursday 5 March, Iain noticed he had a headache. From Sumburgh Head in the south to Out Stack, the northernmost point in the British Isles, Shetland has 567 sq miles of land and 1,679 miles of coastline. Of its 100-odd islands, 16 are inhabited, and about half the 23,000 population, like Iain and his family, live close to Lerwick. In the summer, days are up to 19 hours long; in the winter, if you're lucky, you can see the Northern Lights. The islands were pledged to Scotland by Norway in 1468, and the Norn language - a form of Old Norse spoken on the islands - died out in the mid-19th Century. The Scandinavian influence is still strong, from the Nordic-derived placenames - Burravoe, Grutness, Mavis Grind - to the brightly coloured timber-clad houses dotted across the landscape, and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals, which conclude with the torching of a Viking galley. But despite this Shetlanders don't want the rest of Scotland to forget about them. A 2018 law introduced by the islands' Member of the Scottish Parliament banned public bodies from producing maps that depict Shetland, for reasons of cartographical convenience, in a box in the Moray Firth or east of Orkney rather than its true geographical location. Iain was raised as a Shetlander. He left to study architecture in Edinburgh, where he met Suzanne, but two decades later, after starting a family, they decided to open a practice back on Shetland. It had been their dream for a long time. \"It's just the freedom that you have,\" he says. \"You've got family, friends and that sort of thing. It's a very friendly, positive sort of place.\" He's a well-known figure in Shetland - he sits on the local community council, is a keen Up Helly Aa participant and has played guitar in local bands. The property he and Suzanne designed for their family to the dimensions of a Norse longhouse was featured on the BBC's Scotland's Home of the Year programme. Shetland might be remote, but it is no backwater. Thanks in part to the discovery of North Sea oil in the late 20th Century, its per capita GDP is among the highest of all Scotland's local authority areas. In the 1970s, the local council drove an extraordinarily hard bargain with the energy companies who wanted to operate the terminal at Sullum Voe. Compensation payments were invested in a charitable trust that ensures the islands have exceptionally good public services. \"The facilities up here are second to none,\" says Iain. \"Every little community has its own leisure centre or pool.\" When he woke on the morning of Friday 6 March, Iain still didn't feel well. For the past two days he'd gone in to work, but now he clearly wasn't up to it. One of the friends he'd travelled to Naples with, a Glasgow resident, wasn't feeling great either and had been advised by the NHS to get tested; so Iain and Suzanne arranged to be tested too. Nurses arrived at the couple's house. They stripped off on the porch and, before stepping inside, changed into full PPE - visors, protective suits - before taking swabs from the Malcomsons' noses and the backs of their throats. \"It was like something off the telly,\" Iain says. The whole scenario was unnerving, but the staff were reassuring. \"They were saying: 'You'll be fine, the chances of you having it where you've been are almost zero. So don't worry about it.'\" He says he and Suzanne stayed indoors that weekend anyway. There was a delay while the samples were tested - Iain was told they had to be flown down to Aberdeen and then taken to Glasgow. On Sunday evening the results came through: Shetland had its first confirmed cases of Covid-19. \"Everybody was gobsmacked,\" says Iain. \"And it all kicked off from there.\" At least one person on Shetland wasn't surprised by the arrival of the virus. His name is Michael Dickson. Not long before, as NHS Shetland's chief executive, he'd been summoned to the mainland for a presentation on the likely impact of the pandemic. \"I can honestly say when I came out of the government briefing, it was without a doubt the worst day of my entire career,\" he says. \"To go back to Shetland and have to share that with the people of Shetland was incredibly difficult.\" He also knew that Shetland's geographical isolation would make treating the virus there especially challenging. \"Lovely as it is,\" he says, Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital \"was never built for this.\" There is no intensive care unit anywhere on the islands. At that stage, any patients who became critically unwell would need to be flown to Aberdeen or elsewhere on the mainland in an enormous RAF Atlas military transport aircraft. But Shetland would have advantages, too. Standing at his front door, \"I can cast my eye out and see no-one\", he says. \"There's houses but I'm not going to see anyone walking down the street. If I go for a five-mile run I might run into three or four people. It's just a completely different place to socially distance.\" Also, an outbreak of measles on the Aberdeen ferry meant NHS Shetland had very recent experience of carrying out contact tracing. \"That was hugely useful,\" he says. \"The fact is, knowing the geography of Shetland, the different communities, makes a huge difference.\" This was crucial, Dickson says, after the first positive test results came in. \"When that call went out from the Public Health teams to say we need to do this now, there wasn't a debate. People came in on their Sundays and said 'Right, let's start, let's get on with this.'\" The nurses in visors and PPE suits who came to test the Malcolmsons took the names of everyone they had come in contact with and tested them too. According to Dr Susan Laidlaw, NHS Shetland's public health consultant, staff from other NHS departments were drafted in to phone contacts. \"We had a week of very long hours and intense work following up the contacts, identifying new cases and getting them tested and isolated,\" she says. \"Although difficult at the time, this did help to contain the initial outbreak.\" \"Everybody at our work got it,\" Iain says. \"And everyone from our work's family ended up getting it.\" Some had diarrhoea, others lost all sense of smell and taste. Others fared worse - Iain says the father of one of his employees had to be airlifted to Aberdeen. He would later make a full recovery. While the contact tracers scrambled to identify how far the virus had spread, Iain's condition was getting worse. Suzanne's symptoms were cold-like, but his were more like the flu - a high temperature, shivering. There was talk of flying Iain, too, to Aberdeen. The prospect terrified him. \"I really didn't want to go off the island,\" he says. After a few days, Iain's symptoms began to improve. But the knowledge he might have given the virus to others in less robust health weighed heavily on him. He was terrified he'd given it to his parents, both in their 80s. \"That stress was there, knowing that you could have given it to people who weren't going to be as lucky as you.\" And while he'd been feeling unwell, Iain hadn't felt much like looking at social media. He hadn't yet seen the rumours about him. The virus spread quickly on Shetland. On 12 March, four days after Iain and Suzanne's test results came back, the number of confirmed cases announced in the local press rose from two to six; five days later, they stood at 15; by 19 March, they had risen again to 24. These were not enormous numbers, but they were enough to ensure that Shetland had the highest number of Covid-19 patients in Scotland relative to its population, and one of the highest in the UK. \"I think we were top of the graph possibly in the world at one point,\" says Dickson. As Dickson sees it, this early spike was, in part, testament to the efficiency of the contact tracing teams. A dedicated Covid ward had already been set aside at the hospital. But compared to Orkney and the Western Isles, which had largely been unaffected at that point, Shetland stood out - and Shetlanders were understandably anxious. Dickson believes this was a crucial factor in containing the outbreak; it meant islanders were already taking social distancing seriously before controls on movements were enforced. \"It's a difficult thing to say, but I think having those cases early on enabled us to move possibly more quickly than had we not had cases until later on in the pandemic,\" he says. \"My family live down in Brighton and if you went down to the beach there a week before the lockdown occurred you wouldn't have known anything was different. In Shetland, things have been different pretty much from day one.\" As early as 11 and 12 March, two Up Helly Aa fire festivals - hugely important events in Shetland's social calendar - were called off, in response to appeals from the health board. The following day, while the Cheltenham Gold Cup was going ahead as planned 700 miles away, it was announced that nearly all Shetland's schools would close from 16 March - a week before the rest of the country. Cafes, bars, restaurants and leisure centres were already shutting down across the islands long before the Scottish and Westminster government imposed their lockdowns, says Maggie Sandison, chief executive of the Shetland Islands Council. \"I think there's a really strong sense of community in Shetland,\" says Sandison. Naturally, islanders were anxious to do the right thing by their neighbours. But also, because such a high proportion of the population knew each other, \"people were aware that they may have come into contact with somebody who then became a positive case\" - and this in turn meant they knew to self-isolate. Sandison says the early decision to close schools was taken in part because some teachers had been part of the contact tracing teams and were advised to stay home after coming into face-to-face contact with people who had tested positive. On a sparsely populated group of islands, this was enough to put a strain on staffing levels. At the same time, \"there was quite heightened anxiety from parents\" some of whom were keeping their children at home already. Ferry operators also began preventing tourists and non-residents from travelling to the islands before nationwide restrictions were brought in. \"Because the transport links with the mainland were reduced early on, and the transport operators are only taking people who have essential reasons for travel, this has to some extent isolated the islands,\" says Laidlaw. A weekly Covid-19 Facebook livestream hosted by Dickson would attract as many as 600 viewers at a time. And Shetland's community spirit wasn't just about locking down and staying vigilant. When laundry staff at the hospital found they had a shortage of scrubs, a sewing pattern was posted on Facebook along with an appeal to turn any unwanted bedsheets into medical clothing. \"We had bags and bags of finished scrubs within days,\" says a personal assistant working for NHS Shetland, 38-year-old Lisa Grey, who oversaw the Shetland Scrubs project. As well as bringing extra colour to the wards, superhero patterns on erstwhile children's duvet covers proved especially popular with medical staff. \"You can see it when you're flicking through Facebook - folk saying, 'If anyone needs shopping, I'm off tomorrow.' If anyone needs help, there will always be someone that'll help,\" Grey says. With the rest of Scotland and the UK soon following Shetland's example in locking down, and many other Covid-19 clusters emerging around the UK, the islands felt less like an outlier. But as March turned to April the archipelago's cases kept rising, and before long it would report its first death. Word had spread quickly around the islands that the Malcolmsons had been the first to test positive; Iain had never expected otherwise. \"One thing about Shetland is you have absolutely no anonymity,\" he says. \"People know you're the person that's brought it in.\" To Iain, it was understandable, in a perverse way, when rumours about his family began to circulate on social media. Their names hadn't been officially released, and \"in the absence of fact, people just make stuff up\", he says. \"That's never going to change. There's always a few idiots out there.\" As he hadn't been looking at Facebook, it was news to him when friends got in touch to say the family was \"getting a serious amount of flak\". According to the gossip, on the weekend he and his wife had been tested, \"we were everywhere - we were out on pub crawls, we were out at concerts,\" says Iain. \"That weekend we did everything in Shetland that everyone else was doing. And I don't know why, but they were totally convinced that they'd seen us there.\" It was bad enough when it was confined to Facebook. Then tabloid journalists began calling the house. Iain's friends and family were feeling the pressure. They urged him to go on Facebook and correct the record. Iain really didn't want to do it. He wasn't a big social media person. What if it backfired? Might this not antagonise people further? But something needed to be said. Late one evening, Iain sat down at his computer and began typing. \"After some of the hardest few days we have ever experienced, and it is only getting harder, it is with a heavy heart that Suzanne and I feel it is necessary to put straight some of the more vicious rumours that are circulating about us on social media in Shetland,\" he wrote. After being told they were to be tested and advised to self-isolate, \"we have not left the house since and have not been out partying, or socialising of any kind\". The response was overwhelmingly positive. The post was shared over 1,000 times; friends and neighbours backed up their account; the record was duly corrected. Iain didn't bear a grudge - this was what happened in the absence of reliable information. \"It showed you the good side and the bad side of social media.\" According to National Records of Scotland (NRS), the first death of a person in Shetland with Covid-19 took place some time between 30 March and 5 April. Five more came the following week; a sixth the week after that. On 6 May, another death was announced; there have been no more since then. Tragically, five of the seven were in a single care home. Shetland has good reason to hope it has seen its last coronavirus death of the current peak. The last time a resident of the islands tested positive was 20 April - since then, the total number of confirmed cases has stood still at 54. Nine days afterwards, Dickson told Shetland's local media that the outbreak there may have \"plateaued\". \"They've obviously managed to control the virus by doing an early lockdown,\" says Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, who has advised the Scottish and UK governments. \"Full marks to them, really. Whatever they did worked.\" Shetland's isolation and lack of new cases makes it, along with Orkney, effectively \"a very small-scale New Zealand\", says Prof Pennington - and like New Zealand, he says, the islands could in theory lift their lockdowns by strictly controlling who comes and goes. But the islands' authorities are cool on the idea of a New Zealand-style quarantine. Dickson notes how many patients have to travel to Aberdeen for routine, non-Covid medical treatment: \"So are we saying those people aren't able to go to the mainland because we've closed our borders?\" It's also necessary for the fishing and oil industries for some people to have the ability to travel in and out. It's not just winter and spring events like the Up Helly Aa festivals that have been postponed though, as a result of the lockdown. In 2020 the long summer days will pass on the islands without sheepdog trials, the accordion and fiddle festival, Shetland Wool Week. And there's no end in sight - the first fire festival of 2021 has already been cancelled. The absence of tourists is also being keenly felt. \"My business wouldn't exist without tourism,\" says Lynn Johnson, who runs the Cake Fridge tea room on a single-track road between Voe and Aith on West Shetland Mainland's northern coast. To keep it going, she needs both the lockdown to be lifted and travel to resume. \"We really, really need that spring, summer, along with the big tourism boost that our islands get, to see us through the winter. And we're not going to have that at all.\" But for now, the lockdown is holding. Shetland is ready to resume contact tracing - which was halted in late March, as in the rest of the UK - and Laidlaw says the islands are well prepared for the next phase. Since late April, Shetland has had its own Covid-19 testing equipment, meaning samples no longer have to be sent to the mainland. And two small planes - like the one Iain flew back from holiday on - have been converted into air ambulances. In spite of the apparent success of Shetland's track-and-trace operation, no-one may ever know how the virus arrived there. Iain and his wife may have been the first people on Shetland to have tested positive, but that doesn't mean they were the first to bring it. \"Obviously I know about the contact tracing, the Malcomsons and their experience,\" says Dickson. \"We picked up those people who were diagnosed and got a positive result. I always say, those are the ones we know about. Shetland is a small community but we do have people who come in and out of the islands frequently.\" The couple most likely travelled in with the virus, but \"what we can't guarantee is they were the only people\". And there is no guarantee the Malcolmsons caught the virus in Italy either, as it is thought to have been circulating in Edinburgh, where they changed flights, since February."

        "text": "The government has come under pressure from MPs and businesses to relax the 2m (6ft) rule for social distancing, to make it easier for people to return to work. But scientists continue to question whether that would be safe, given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread. The simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization says that a distance of 1m is safe. Some countries have adopted this guidance, while others, including the UK, have gone further: Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. In a study published in the medical journal The Lancet, scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread. They conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission. But some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If that is the case, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Professor Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out at hospitals in China, which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But for the US Centers for Disease Control, the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is \"currently uncertain\". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. There is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19, following up the contacts of the people infected. They estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside. In many countries, including England and Scotland, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and \"enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible\". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions. It will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried, and how viable it remains, which will all take time."

        "text": "Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a \"dangerous moment\" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. \"It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,\" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at \"Level 4\" rather than \"Level 3\" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is \"not a lot of room\" for manoeuvre and the data \"urges caution\". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and \"we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate\". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those \"following the science\". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. \"Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,\" argued Prof Calum Semple. Major deja vu feeling to mid March. Scientists incredibly concerned, politicians ignoring this, public doesn't want life disturbed. End of Twitter post  by @devisridhar There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a \"second wave\". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. \"With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,\" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: \"I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. \"It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.\" Follow James on Twitter"

        "text": "Lockdown restrictions are gradually being eased across the UK, but the rules are different in each of the four nations. So, what sports can you play and who can you meet? The overall advice remains \"stay at home\" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. However, small-sided or full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, if social distancing guidelines are followed, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. More than two people can now meet outside across the UK: In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. Children are included in the headcount for groups meeting in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales, two large families can meet - as long as each of them lives at a single address. And remember, social distancing guidelines - with people from different households remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - still apply across the whole of the UK. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible for many people who want to see their friends and family. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: \"It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet.\" Overnight stays are also still not permitted. Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, said: \"If you were to do something like a barbecue, remember that passing things from one person to another, if you haven't washed your hands, you can pass the virus that way.\" The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. The rules in Wales so far say you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not \"an invitation to go into a garden, have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people\". People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible and, if you do go out, take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household. There is another group of about 2.5 million people, categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. These include people who have had organ transplants, cancer patients and those with severe respiratory conditions. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called \"shielding\". Now people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again, while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Despite the easing of lockdown restrictions across the UK, scientists stress the need for people from different households to remain 2m (6ft) apart. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. This coronavirus appears to thrive in crowded, indoor spaces which is why pubs, restaurants and many workplaces remain closed and the public has been advised against using public transport. But virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should stay at home and not leave it for any reason. This is known as self-isolation. You should not leave your property even to buy food or medicine, and instead order these online, or ask someone to drop them off at your home. If the NHS Test and Trace team in England gets in touch because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you will have to self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but they must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

        "text": "Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children. Exact rules vary, but head teachers have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Head teachers have been told to keep focussing on priority pupils - vulnerable children and those of critical workers - across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Beyond these groups, nursery and pre-school children plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 will go back first in England. But not every primary school will reopen. A BBC Breakfast survey of 150 councils revealed many are not guaranteeing this. Of the 99 who responded, only 20 said they were advising schools to open more widely on 1 June: Another 15 said they would not be advising schools to open their doors to more pupils: Two-thirds (68) could not guarantee schools would reopen to Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Plans include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could look different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is \"very, very small, but not zero\", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. But there is much uncertainty in the advice, and the group \"cannot be clear\" on the extent to which schools can reopen without increasing Covid-19 cases. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools will not be ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. But Schools Minister Nick Gibb told MPs there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in England back before the summer break. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It remains unclear how many families will take up the offer to go back. A study from the National Foundation for Educational Research, based on 1,200 school leaders, suggests: The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen to Year 10 and Year 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time. Students will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. As of 22 May, about 244,000 children were attending school in England - 2.6% of the total number of pupils. That figure included 75,000 \"vulnerable\" children - which the Department for Education estimates to be 15% of all young people in that category. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales and Scotland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England and Wales, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. Exam watchdogs have been working together on alternative arrangements. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?

        "text": "The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are \"far from complete and comprehensible\". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had \"temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. \"People tested\" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with \"void\" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one \"person tested\" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a \"small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test\", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was \"just not happening\". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as \"smoke and mirrors\". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to \"show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the \"people tested\" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the \"people tested\" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as \"people tested\" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed \"to avoid confusion\". Follow Rachel on Twitter"

        "text": "Outdoor markets and car showrooms have been able to open again in England from Monday as the government eases its restrictions on some retail sites classed as \"non-essential\". So, what can customers expect and what is the timetable for the reopening of other types of outlets? Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations have been able to remain open during the coronavirus lockdown. But now that list has grown in England. From Monday, open air markets and car showrooms have been allowed to reopen. The government says they must meet the Covid-19 secure guidelines to protect shoppers and workers. It says, as with garden centres (which reopened in England on 13 May), the risk of transmission of the virus \"is lower in these outdoor and more open spaces\". One car dealership is trusting customers to take test drives alone. The National Association of British Markets Authorities chief executive, David Preston, though expects a lot of older stallholders will not return because of virus fears. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland on Monday, prompting long queues. Hundreds of people starting queueing hours before the stores opened as Ikea asked them to come prepared with ready-made shopping lists and their own bags. From 15 June, non-essential stores in England will be able to reopen. This includes shops selling things like clothes, toys, books and electronics, as well as tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets. Among department stores, John Lewis will open 13 branches initially, while Next will only reopen 25 of its 500 stores on 15 June. Primark will keep its 190 shops closed until it is \"convinced that it is safe and right\" to open them. No dates have been set for the reopening of shops in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but each country has plans in place. Smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in Scotland in phase two of its lockdown easing plan. In Wales, non-essential shops and services could happen in the amber phase of its exit strategy. Non-food retail outlets can reopen in step two of Northern Ireland's plan. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. And those measures are also likely to feature in other shops. But some more unfamiliar measures are also expected to be put in place to try to reduce the spread of the virus. Shoe shop Kurt Geiger will put footwear aside for 24 hours after a customer has tried them on, and Waterstones has said it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone, if they can, and talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited and shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) estimates that the current lockdown is costing non-essential retailers \u00a31.8bn a week in lost sales, and it does not expect that to pick up immediately shops reopen. \"Evidence from other countries suggests that, despite an initial bounce in spending in the weeks after restrictions are lifted, discretionary spend is likely to remain subdued as the coronavirus pandemic wears on,\" said the BRC's Kyle Monk. The British Independent Retailers Association's chief executive, Andrew Goodacre, believes fewer people than before will go shopping and they may \"soon become weary of queuing\". He told the BBC: \"Social distancing also takes away the fun and positive experience of shopping. All these factors mean that it will be difficult at first, and for many months after.\" Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest, if they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection falls. Hospitality firms and some other small businesses may have to wait longer to reopen. And Mike Cherry, national chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, wants the government to \"provide those firms some idea of when they'll be able to get back to work\". He added: \"High Streets up and down the country have been largely empty for months now, and while more businesses in England may be able to open up soon, there may well be not enough custom to justify the financial and health costs. \"Until people feel safe enough to spend, small businesses face a long struggle back to steady ground.\""

        "text": "The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone \"we're all going to wash our hands once an hour\". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says \"wash your hands\". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."

        "text": "Anyone with coronavirus symptoms should get tested so Covid-19 can be controlled as the lockdown eases, says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But the UK statistics watchdog has criticised the government's handling of the testing data. So how much testing is being done? In England and Wales anyone with symptoms can get a swab test. In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On Sunday, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May - describing it as \"an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus\". But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes  testing kits posted out to homes. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has now criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing \"the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Sir David Norgrove has written to Mr Hancock saying the information is \"far from complete\", presented in a way that is \"difficult to understand\", and relevant figures may be \"misleadingly\" described. He points out: Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test doesn't work. Sir David is also calling for more detailed data on those being tested. He wants age, sex, location and job to be included - such as working in a care home or hospital. The government says it releases full data. A spokesman said the government was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to \"increase transparency around the government's response to coronavirus\". The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or by someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past and since recovered. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples from patients. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only being offered to health and care staff. Testing is essential if the contact-tracing systems now in place in all four UK nations are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. Tests can also help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. They can also let the health service plan for extra demand and inform government decisions around social distancing and lockdowns. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered to your door. The government says home test kits will be limited at first, because of a lack of availability. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Couriers will collect samples and take them to laboratories. The government says it aims to return test results within 48 hours of a swab being taken, or within 72 hours for a home test. Speed is important if the contact-tracing systems across the UK are to work well - because delays will give the virus more time to spread. Speaking the day before England's tracing system was launched, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was now a target to get test results in less than 24 hours. But the Department of Health and Social Care said no formal deadline had been set to achieve this. On the same day, the head of England's test and trace programme, Dido Harding, said 84% of tests at drive-through centres were returned within 24 hours, and 95% within 48 hours. She didn't provide a figure for home testing kits or those provided at other settings. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

        "text": "As schools prepare to reopen on Monday to children in years one and six, some parents' social media feeds have turned toxic. Kirstie Brewer talks to mothers feeling judged or shamed for their decision to send children back to school - or to keep them at home. Marsha's WhatsApp group went pinging into overdrive as soon as it was announced that primary schools and nurseries would reopen for some children on 1 June. There was outrage, relief, excitement, anxiety. Everyone seemed to have an opinion. Marsha wrote that she'd be happy to send her son back to school. Then immediately another mum shared a news item about a teacher who'd tested positive for coronavirus. \"This is why I will be keeping Rosie safe at home with me - I'm not putting her life at risk,\" she wrote. A few other parents then sent thumbs-up and shocked-face emojis to show their approval of Rosie's mum's message. \"It felt very passive-aggressive,\" says Marsha, who said she didn't want her real name to be published because she couldn't face \"more drama\". The WhatsApp group she belongs to is for parents with a child in year one at a school in the Bristol area and is normally a source of useful information. But since the pandemic hit, it's become toxic, she says. \"People have been posting lots of screengrabs from Facebook which are full of misinformation about how the virus spreads and the risks to children,\" she says. \"But if you dare to try to correct anything or put things into perspective you get shot down and it is implied you are a bad parent. \"I'm trying to hold down a full-time job while also homeschooling two children - I find being judged by other parents on top of that very hard to deal with.\" Sophia, 25, had a similar experience when she commented on a Facebook group for single mums that her four-year-old daughter would be returning to preschool. She was branded \"selfish\" by another mum - and then she watched as that damning verdict was endorsed by \"likes\" from other members of the group. Normally this would be a very positive, empowering community says Sophia, who works full-time as a charity consultant, so it's a sign of how much times have changed. \"It showed me how much the lockdown is getting to people,\" she says. \"It feels as if the worst assumptions are being made about someone's reasons for sending their child back to school or nursery.\" Sophia's daughter has special educational needs and for weeks now she hasn't had access to her usual speech therapy. \"She learns a lot by being with other children so being at preschool is the next best thing for her,\" she explains. \"I could have a PhD in children's education and it would still be better for her to be around other children. There is no substitute for that.\" Parents who have decided to keep their children at home haven't escaped the crosshairs either. Harriet Shearsmith, founder of parenting website Toby & Roo, has an Instagram following of 116,000 and is one of the few \"mummy bloggers\" to have publicly stated her position on this divisive issue. She won't be sending her children back when the schools reopen in June, but when she explained this decision she was careful to add the caveat that she wasn't criticising other parents. \"If you fall into the group of people who are choosing differently to me or you simply don't have a choice, this isn't a judgement of you or a dismissal of your situation,\" she wrote. Some nonetheless responded witheringly that Harriet obviously didn't care much about her children's education - but as an experienced blogger she is accustomed to dealing with it. \"I've had comments, you know, 'You're going to be damaging your children,' or, 'You're just not very intelligent and a terrible mother.' That kind of thing is said, but I largely just ignore it,\" she says. \"Lockdown has made us all much quicker to lose our tempers. We are much more frayed and we are all in very stressful positions, regardless of what those positions might be.\" Fellow blogger Alison Perry says she has also noticed the ground shifting. \"It feels like all the social 'rules' have changed,\" she says. \"Everyone feels very differently about homeschooling and screen time and even just interpreting the government guidelines. I'm usually a very outspoken person but have found myself biting my tongue, because whatever I say, there will be someone there telling me I'm wrong or selfish.\" Liz, who lives near Cambridge, points to another possible explanation - people now have more time to spend on social media, she says, so any backlash gets amplified. Like Marsha and Sophia, she is planning on sending one of her children back to school on Monday. \"It's really difficult to know what the right decision is but we think that the benefits of our son going back to school outweigh the risk of him becoming ill,\" she says. She has been hurt by judgemental comments from other parents on her Facebook group, some of whom she's known for several years. \"Apparently those of us who are willing to send our children back to school when they reopen are sending them back to be 'guinea pigs' or 'canaries', to see if cases are going to rise again,\" she says. \"I said I found it offensive. That does imply that anyone who is happy to send their child back to school is throwing them to the wolves, so to speak, whereas actually we  just want some normality for our children, and, you know, education and socialisation.\" When she made this point in response to a critic on Facebook she says she was accused of \"bullying\". The issue seems to have caused a deep divide, she notes with regret. She has now minimised her time on social media and advises other parents in her position to do the same. The parents on Marsha's group who are sending their children to school have taken a different approach - they have started avoiding the main group chat and talking among themselves instead. A few parents on Mumsnet who've made the decision to send their child back to school say they've felt bruised by the negative responses of family or friends, which seem to be driven by worries about the infection risk. Many people are highly dubious that the youngest children can really be prevented from sharing bugs and carrying them out into the community, and lots of people have picked up on teachers' concerns about whether schools have had enough time to prepare a really safe environment. It seems likely that people's responses are driven by understandable fear and uncertainty, but if you're a parent run ragged by nine weeks of homeschooling while attempting to hold down a job, other people's judgement is likely to be the last thing you need. The first rule of self-care is to find time for yourself. But how do you do that when you have to juggle work and family duties? Easy, says Sue Elliott-Nicholls, just steal it.

        "text": "The government has told schools to reopen for certain year groups from 1 June. But what does it mean in practical terms for schools - and how are they getting ready? We spoke to one head teacher to find out. \"It's like doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are green.\" That is how Debbie Whiting, head teacher of North Denes Primary School in Norfolk, describes the task in front of her - remodelling her school during a pandemic so that three classes can return next month. \"The more you look at things, the more there is to think about,\" she says. Classrooms have been stripped out, new signage put up around the school and year groups divided into small \"bubbles\" to keep pupils away from each other and - it is hoped - minimise the risk of coronavirus spreading. The school in Great Yarmouth already knows it will not be ready to reopen for Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 classes on 1 June, and is instead working to a deadline of 8 June. This summer the school should have been preparing to move into its new \u00a39m buildings, but construction delays mean all focus is now on making the existing school safe for returning pupils. \"The 1 June date might be convenient for being after half-term but it's not given us anything like the time we need to put things in place,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"It's really difficult. You just keep thinking, have we caught everything?\" Parents have been asked whether they will send their children back - but only half have responded, making planning difficult. So far, one-third of those who have replied say their children will return. Mrs Whiting estimates she can make her plans work if about 40% of the 180 children return. If they all came back, she would need an extra 12 classrooms at the school. The school hopes to make social distancing as natural as possible for children by breaking classes into smaller \"bubbles\" of about seven pupils and two teachers. But without knowing the intentions of the other families, the plans could be useless. Mrs Whiting has left the decision up to parents, but wrote to them recently to warn them \"school will be a very different place\". \"Until we have those numbers, planning to keep everyone safe in bubbles is really tricky,\" she said. \"My concern is that they've heard that schools are reopening and on 1 June they just arrive.\" For the rest of term, all school life will take place within the bubbles. In those groups pupils will learn, eat and play, with each bubble using a nominated classroom and set of toilets to prevent cross-infection. Children will not be allowed to take bags to school, and will work in a new exercise book and their teacher will not take them home to mark. Uniform policy will be scrapped as children will need to wear clean clothes every day \"and many will have outgrown it anyway\". \"If they've got different clothes on every day you'll know that they've actually changed,\" said Mrs Whiting. The school has gained experience from teaching the children of key workers over the past weeks, and the numbers have steadily risen from eight pupils to 20. \"Parents will expect us to social-distance their children, and we intend to do that,\" says Mrs Whiting. The school day will be re-organised, with staggered starts and a lunchtime finish once children have been given their food. In the morning, children in each bubble will arrive at 15-minute intervals, and line up in the playground two metres (6ft 6ins) apart before being led into their classrooms. Only one parent will be allowed to drop off and collect each child, with no gathering by the school gates, though Mrs Whiting acknowledges getting several children to school at different times is \"likely to cause problems\" in single-parent households. Bubbles will be kept separate at break times and when they are given lunch, with each being given their own area of the playground to use. Even before coronavirus, the school was without its kitchen because of building works, and could only use half of its main hall. Pupils' movements around the school will be restricted mainly to their bubbles, but the way they use the communal areas will change. Each year will have a separate entrance to the buildings, and school corridors will operate a one-way system so people can maintain their distance. Doors will be left propped open and handles cleaned regularly. \"It's about controlling all movement,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"We also started careful hand washing before the lockdown and the children have been pretty good at that.\" Hand dryers in the toilets have been switched off on official advice, and replaced with paper towels, while the school has ordered pedal bins for every classroom so that PPE - which will be used for first aid or personal care - can be disposed of safely and without contact. Classrooms will also look different, with the need for distancing reducing capacity to about eight desks. All rooms have now been decluttered and non-essential items removed, filling the school's storage spaces. In the younger age groups' classrooms, soft furnishings, rugs and toys have been removed - anything remaining will have to be washed at the end of each day. Cleaning routines have been stepped up and surfaces will be disinfected regularly. Pupils will be asked to bring their own stationery, and forbidden from sharing. In a letter to parents, Mrs Whiting had previously warned \"there is no such thing as social distancing in a school - we can try but we certainly cannot guarantee it\". The logistics of preparing the school come on top of the everyday challenges of leading a school in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country. \"The government line is to get children in school so that they don't fall behind, and in disadvantaged areas that is important,\" says Mrs Whiting. \"But a lot of those who want to return are not those who are in that group.\" The Department for Education says it wants children back in schools \"for their education and wellbeing\", and the phased return is based on scientific and medical advice. For head teachers, the last few weeks have been \"wearing\", says Mrs Whiting, as they juggle pressures from government, parents who want their children to be kept at home, and those who want them back at school. Underpinning all the preparations, her focus has been on keeping the children as safe as possible. \"This is something I've never ever had to deal with,\" she said. \"And you do wonder what happens if someone gets it and, heaven forbid, there's a fatality? \"But I can't hold myself responsible for that, because I'm not the one who is asking them to come back.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"

        "text": "Some children in England will be going back to school from Monday 1 June. Following a heated debate, the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom. Children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus. Adults - and particularly older adults - are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus. Across the UK, 0.01% of deaths were people under 15, 1% were aged 15-44 and about 75% were over 75. Half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were 60 as at 15 May, and half were younger, according to a research charity. But the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40. Children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases, according to Prof Adilia Warris, a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the University of Exeter. They often have \"milder disease than adults,\" she says, pointing out that deaths have been rare. There have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease, and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus. This is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads. It is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is - at any age. To understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population, and work out how they might have caught it. A University College London review of the evidence, based on studies using contact tracing and population screening, suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus. The government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the \"balance of evidence\" suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and, if they do catch it, less likely to pass it on. But the \"evidence remains inconclusive,\" it said. One study looking at cases in Shenzhen in China at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus, raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms. But research carried out since then has been more reassuring. Studies of clusters of infections in family groups across China have concluded - based on contact tracing - that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children. A study of a cluster of infections in the French Alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms. Community studies in Iceland, South Korea, the Netherlands and  Italy all found evidence children were less likely to have - or have had - the virus than adults. The Italian region studied tested 70% of its population. A review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded: \"The role of children in transmission is unclear, but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection, and lower rates of children bringing infections into households.\" One theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells. But experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this. More children in schools means more teachers working, and more parents at the school gates, and it's not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection. As the Sage report says, \"It is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff, parents, and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school.\" The group of scientists modelled nine different \"return to school\" scenarios. On 16 May, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the R number - the measure of how fast the disease is spreading - while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school. It was reported that in 22 European Union countries where schools were partially reopened, there hadn't been a significant increase in cases, including among staff. These countries all opened up schools to different extents. France did report a small uptick in cases after partially re-opening schools. But World Health Organization (WHO) chief scientist Dr Soumya Swaminathan agrees that children are \"less capable\" of spreading the virus, and are at \"very low risk\" of getting ill from the disease. \"What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.\" Government guidelines say it wants to start with Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children in England because: The government says secondary schools in England will be able to reopen to Year 10 and Year 12 from Monday 15 June. But only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time The schools minister Nick Gibbs told MPs there is still no decision about the government's ambition to send all primary children in England back before the summer break."

        "text": "Around 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home. This \"shielding\" is to protect lives. While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves. The guidance on shielding is being kept under review as the UK moves out of lockdown. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from Monday 1 June, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. Other parts of the UK have not yet recommended the same. Those most at risk, who include: While it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, over half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. Over 90,000 are children. Anyone in this highest risk category who has not yet received a letter from the NHS or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online. This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing. Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations. You could call your doctor to discuss this. It means staying at home and following the guidelines. You should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors. Visits from people who provide you essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing with soap and water. They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you. They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing. They should also keep some physical distance (two metres) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window. If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels. If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery, unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too. Keep surfaces that are frequently touched clean - door handles, taps and handrails. Communities Minister Robert Jenrick said parcels of food, which would be free initially, and medicines would be delivered to those affected via community hubs. The Treasury will cover the cost and in time hope to refine the scheme so it is \"more tailored to individuals' needs\". In England, people have been asked to shield until the end of June and this date will be reviewed. In Wales, it's 15 and in Northern Ireland and Scotland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to. The ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. A vaccine could help towards this. These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading: Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible. Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online. Prepare a hospital bag just in case - this should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas. You can register for support with food, shopping and deliveries and additional care. Over two million food boxes have been delivered in England since the programme started."

        "text": "The UK government has set various targets during its efforts to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Have they been met? \"We will massively scale up our testing capacity in the weeks ahead so we hit 25,000 tests a day\" - Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 18 March Outcome: On the same day a press release from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) gave more details of the tests to diagnose coronavirus and said \"the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks\". But the government did not hit 25,000 tests a day by mid-April. Only 18,665 tests were conducted in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) on 15 April. In terms of testing capacity - the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day - that stood at more than 30,000 by mid-April. \"I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month\" - Health Secretary Matt Hancock, 2 April Outcome: On 1 May, the government said it had reached the target and announced 122,347 tests for the last day of the month (30 April). The testing figure had been averaging about 20,000 a day but increased significantly in the last days of April. When home testing kits were introduced in large numbers towards the end of the month, DHSC began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures. So, it doesn't mean the test was actually used by someone on that day. Previously, only instances in which the testing swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test. The 122,347 figure included about 40,000 kits sent out to homes and test centres. In a letter to Mr Hancock on 2 June, Sir David Norgrove, chair of statistical watchdog the UK Statistics Authority, was critical of this methodology. \"The aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding,\" he wrote. Prof John Newton, who leads the government's testing programme, said on 1 May: \"That's the way they are counted, have always been counted, and the way we were advised to count them by officials.\" In May, using that methodology, the government hit its target 18 times and missed it 13 times. The devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing. But Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5,000 tests a day by mid-April, blaming problems obtaining testing kits. Likewise, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 April that Scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10,000 tests per day by the end of April, saying \"we are working towards a capacity of 3,500 by the end of April\". The Scottish Government announced at the beginning of May that it had reached this reduced target. \"The ambition, clearly, is to get up to 200,000 a day by the end of this month, and then to go even higher\" - Boris Johnson in Parliament 6 May There had been some confusion as to whether the target for testing by the end of May was 200,000 tests conducted or a capacity to do this many tests. Matt Hancock eventually clarified that it would be the capacity for tests, and that it would include antibody tests (which establish whether somebody previously had the virus) and tests being sent out to a random cross-section of society by statisticians, as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms. On 30 May, the DHSC announced that the UK had hit the target, with labs able to process 205,634 tests a day. This included capacity to do 40,000 antibody tests a day. On 31 May, they carried out 23,000 antibody tests. When it comes to number of people actually tested for coronavirus on a daily basis, the government has not released this figure since 22 May. The DHSC says the number has been \"temporarily paused.\" \"We are working with Boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of April\" - Matt Hancock statement, 4 April Outcome: DHSC told the BBC on 4 May that 49 regional test centres were operational across the country. Mr Hancock had previously said in a statement that there would be \"over 50\" by the end of April. The \"drive-through\" test centres are run by Boots and other commercial providers. DHSC also said that 96 mobile testing sites were in service by 4 May. \"By mid May, we'll have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place\" - Matt Hancock, 1 May Outcome: On 1 May, Mr Hancock said that the government's testing programme was the \"first element\" in the wider strategy to \"test, track and trace\". He added that an \"initial 18,000\" contact tracing staff would be in place \"by mid-May\". Their role is to identify individuals that have Covid-19 and then to \"track and trace\" anyone they've recently been in contact with. Those individuals can then get themselves tested. On 18 May, Mr Hancock told Parliament that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited in England, of whom 7,500 were healthcare professionals. And on 20 May, Mr Johnson told Parliament, \"already we have recruited 24,000 trackers - by 1 June we will have 25,000.\" \"I have great confidence that by 1 June we will have a system that will help us very greatly to defeat this disease.\" On 1 June, Matt Hancock said that the contact tracers had been working since Thursday 28 May, but would not give figures for how many people they had contacted. \"On the personal protective equipment, the answer is by the end of this week.\" - Boris Johnson, 25 March Outcome: On 25 March, Mr Johnson was asked in parliament when \"every single person\" working in care homes around the country would receive the personal protective equipment (PPE) they needed. He said it would happen by the end of that week. However, that didn't appear to happen. In early April, Nadra Ahmed, from the National Care Association, said, \"The issue we hear most is, 'I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.' Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\" According to those working in the care home sector, the situation improved later in April but was not resolved. Martin Green from Care England said on 20 April that \"access to PPE remains problematic\" and that care homes still need \"a consistent supply\". The DHSC says that from 25 February to 27 May over 1.51 billion items of PPE have been delivered across the health and social care system in England (it hasn't given a figure for care homes). This includes: It has been counting gloves individually so this last figure would be over 451m if counted as pairs. Concerns about the availability of PPE in care homes have also been raised in Scotland and Wales. \"Making sure that the NHS always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical\" - Matt Hancock, 17 April Outcome: The government has met its objective. By 18 May, the last day the figures were published, the proportion of critical care beds occupied by Covid-19 patients had fallen to 20% in England, 17% in Wales, 10% in Scotland and 15% in Northern Ireland. The spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for the virus. The government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment. \"Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks\" - Matt Hancock, 5 April Outcome: The DHSC told the BBC that, by 5 May, the government had managed to make 10,900 mechanical ventilators available to the NHS across the UK. Mr Hancock's 18,000 target was for this type of ventilator, according to the DHSC. The original UK target had been higher but was reduced, Mr Hancock said, because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus. A spokesperson for the DHSC said: \"Every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one. We continue to keep capacity ahead of demand.\" This article was updated to reflect the latest figures on testing and contact tracers. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "text": "About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated \u00a310bn to the economy. But ceremonies this year have been devastated by the coronavirus outbreak. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights - and are you entitled to a refund? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to start taking place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland currently allows weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have also applied for emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment\", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act\", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to \u00a330,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."

        "text": "People who've been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 in England and Scotland are now being traced by thousands of health workers. BBC News answers some of your questions on how the schemes will work. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can\u2019t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth \u00a395.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. No.The Department of Health says the service will begin tracking those who tested positive in England on Wednesday and going forward. Anyone who tested positive before that should already be self-isolating for at least seven days, with other members of their household self-isolating for 14 days While most NHS contact tracers won\u2019t be trained health professionals, there is also a clinical team of local public health experts which will deal with more complex cases. The Department of Health says if someone who works in a care home tests positive, it will be escalated to this team and it will work with the care home to agree the best course of action. It will consider things like whether personal protective equipment was worn and whether staff had been able to remain at a distance from each other. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage. Yes, people who have previously tested positive will be asked to self-isolate again. That's because there are still a number of uncertainties about whether having coronavirus gives you immunity, or whether people with immunity can transmit the illness to others. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who tested positive for the virus in March, told LBC Radio that he would have to isolate if he was approached by a contact tracer. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford\u2019s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland's chief dental officer has expressed hope that routine dental care will be available by the end of July. In Wales, the aim is to gradually reintroduce routine dental care before January 2021, and Northern Irish dentists are to discuss a schedule for reopening at a meeting on 2 June. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. All personal protective equipment (PPE) worn during the highest-risk situations - such as aprons, gloves and surgical masks - should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. However, guidelines now say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises \"some compromise\" is needed in these \"exceptional circumstances\". But doctors and nurses are not happy with this situation. The Royal College of Nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a \"last resort\" if adequate PPE has not been provided. If you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. \"If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,\" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. \"Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.\" It\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK\u2019s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will \"remain unprecedented\" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to \"long waiters\", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre-Covid-19 levels\u201d. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that \"infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. Primary schools in England are starting to reopen from 1 June, depending on the number - pupils in Reception and Years 1 and 6 are among the first to return. It's expected that about half of the children entitled to return will do so. At present, it is not compulsory for parents to send their children to school, and there will be no fines for non-attendance. However, the government says that eligible children are \"strongly encouraged\" to attend. It is expected that this temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - will continue for all parents of any year groups going back in England during the summer term. There are currently no plans for schools in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland to reopen before the end of the summer term. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are \"no restrictions\" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: \"Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes.\" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may \"vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe\", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. The number of flights arriving in the UK has dropped dramatically during lockdown. The UK government has said it will introduce a two-week quarantine period for international passengers from 8 June. If travellers cannot say where they plan to self-isolate, then they will do so in accommodation arranged by the government. There are some exemptions, including people arriving from the Republic of Ireland. Airlines and airport operators have said that maintaining social distancing is very difficult, and many are advising passengers to wear face coverings and gloves. Healthrow is trialling large-scale temperature checks for some passengers. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. There is no specific guidance on this, according to employment lawyer Susie Al-Qassab, but as long as you are not unwell, and your role permits it, your employer should allow you to work from home on full pay. If you cannot do your job from home, then the unpaid leave may be seen as a suspension and may not be allowed. You should check your contract to see what your employer is entitled to do. If they are acting beyond their rights, they will need to seek to reach an agreement with you not to attend work for a specific period (which would usually need to be treated as paid leave) Statutory sick pay (SSP) is currently payable to all those who are self-isolating. You should query whether this is available to those who are self-isolating because they have returned to the UK from abroad. If you\u2019re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of \u00a37,500. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months (\u00a36,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job \"absolutely cannot be done from home\". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. If you are employed, your employer has an obligation to pay your Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) for up to 28 weeks. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. In the case of small and medium-sized employers, the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days. Eligible employees are entitled to \u00a395.85 a week. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it\u2019s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: \"We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,\" he said. \"So we are talking about really large numbers of people.\" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who\u2019s leading the Church\u2019s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job.

        "text": "Lockdown measures are starting to be eased after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? From Monday in England, you will be able to meet in groups of up to six people from different households outside - either in parks or now also in private gardens - as long as you remain 2m (6ft) apart. From Friday in Scotland, members of two different households will be allowed to meet up outdoors if you maintain social distancing. Groups cannot be bigger than eight, and people are \"strongly recommended\" not to meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, the BBC understands that people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland, although outdoor weddings with 10 people present may be allowed from 8 June. There is no longer any limit to the amount of time you can spend outside doing exercise, or in \"open-air recreation\" like sunbathing in England and, from Friday, in Scotland. Currently, you can play outdoor sports such as golf or tennis with members of your household or with one other person from another household (while maintaining social distance). From Monday, people in England will also be able to exercise outside with up to five others from different households. That means small groups of sport teams can resume fitness sessions, but social distancing must be maintained. In Scotland, outdoor activities where physical distancing can be maintained can resume from Friday. This includes golf, tennis, bowls and fishing. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, where the rules are different. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. However, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced the lifting of some lockdown measures in the country from 29 May. As well as meeting people from one other household outside, people will also be able to sit or sunbathe in parks and open areas. It will also be possible to travel - preferably by walking or cycling - for recreation, although people will be asked to remain \"where possible\" within or close to their own local area. Rules in Wales are set to be relaxed next week, while any changes in Northern Ireland will be confirmed after the executive meets next Thursday. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so \"for the foreseeable future\". But the government says those who can't, should travel to their workplace if it is open - and walk, cycle or drive if at all possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport. Those who do use buses or trains are being told to expect social-distance queuing and to wear face coverings. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay at home and shield will be able to spend some time outdoors again from Monday 1 June, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. These people all have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable to coronavirus. It means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2 metres apart. Other parts of the UK have not yet recommended the same. House moves and viewings can resume again in England. Potential buyers and renters will be able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England have now been told they can return to work - but only if they're caring for youngsters who come from the same household. During lockdown, registered childminders have either been closed or providing care for vulnerable children or children of key workers. The government has said it would like pre-school nurseries in England to start reopening from 1 June. The government's ambition is for all primary school children in England to return to school before the summer for a month if feasible. In England, pupils in nurseries, early years and Reception and Years 1 and 6 at primary schools will be able to return from 1 June. Class sizes are expected to be no more than 15 pupils, with staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. From 15 June, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their \"continued remote, home learning\". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. The university watchdog says new students must be told with \"absolute clarity\" how they will be taught before accepting a place. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen from 1 June, if they are \"Covid-secure\". But the government has said these dates could change if coronavirus infection rates increase. Garden centres have already reopened in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. They are now due to reopen in Scotland. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will open from 4 July at the earliest, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection goes down. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and the government has now said a two-week quarantine period for people arriving in the UK will be introduced \"as soon as possible\". There will be some exemptions for people arriving from the Republic of Ireland as part of the Common Travel Area. If international travellers cannot say where they plan to self-isolate for 14 days, they will have to do so in accommodation arranged by the government. All passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory.

        "text": "One of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months, with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year. Some airlines have grounded their entire fleets, while others have been focusing on cargo flights, in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can. Now, however, many carriers are making plans to get back in the air. Ryanair, for example, says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from July, EasyJet is starting a limited service this month and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of August, while Air France KLM and Lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of June. Hungarian carrier Wizz Air has already resumed flights. In the UK, the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 June - which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country. But can passengers fly safely, or will they be at risk of infection? The Covid-19 coronavirus is still relatively new, so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply. But previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses. Based on the available information, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections. A 2018 study by researchers from Emory University in Atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft, and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases. \"A droplet-mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger. Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger,\" the researchers concluded. But contrary to this, earlier research - led by the same academics - had shown that in real life cases passengers with Sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area. Their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport, while embarking or disembarking from the plane, or from touching contaminated surfaces, rather than by breathing in infected droplets. The simulations also indicated that, because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers, they could generate several new infections, and concluded \"it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill\". Meanwhile, public health officials in Canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from Guangzhou to Toronto were found to have Covid-19. The flight had 350 people on board, and lasted for 15 hours. Although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections, the chief engineer at aerospace giant Airbus insists that is not the case. Jean-Brice Dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean. \"Every two to three minutes, mathematically, all the air is renewed,\" he says. \"That means 20 to 30 times per hour, the air around you is completely renewed.\" Put simply, air is collected from outside the aircraft, normally through the engine, and mixed with recycled air from the cabin. The recycled air, which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels, is passed through HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters that are similar to those used in hospitals. The Covid-19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter (a nanometre is a billionth of a metre) and is within the particle-size range that HEPA filters capture - 10 nanometres and above. Mr Dumont says: \"HEPA filters have standards, and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards. They filter out 99.97% of particulates (small particles) of the size of Covid-19.\" The flow of the air itself, he explains, is also designed to minimise infection risks. \"The air flows vertically. It is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet. That makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited. So a passenger from row one, for example, cannot contaminate someone in row 20.\" But is this enough? This regular flow of air, from top to bottom, can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles, thus altering the path of any airborne particles. And crucially, while HEPA filters do work, they can't capture all Covid-19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in, says Dr Julian Tang, consultant virologist at the Leicester Royal Infirmary and associate professor at Leicester University. He is also one of the team behind a study, published this month, looking at minimising the airborne transmission of Covid-19 in enclosed spaces. \"Filtration only works on mass airflows, most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short-range face-to-face conversations. Close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane, train or a bus - this is the biggest risk.\" And even if you are further away, the risk is not eliminated, says Dr Tang. \"How long Covid-19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors. It varies between different people, it varies depending on the state of your infection, and you can't say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres. \"Some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres - and they all could be carrying the virus.\" Dr Tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as Covid-19 or Mers, Sars and influenza, something which they argue has been overlooked. But Mr Dumont believes that simple precautions, such as wearing masks, and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks. \"I want to be precise on that. We want people to wear masks,\" he says. This, he claims, combined with the rapid replacement of air, should minimise exposure. So, would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft, for example by blocking out middle seats - a move contemplated by some airlines, but described by Ryanair's CEO Michael O'Leary as \"idiotic\"? \"We don't think so,\" says Mr Dumont. \"It doesn't add to the risk reduction, we believe.\" Virologist Dr Tang disagrees: \"The problem is that if you're sitting next to somebody - 0.6 metres in economy, say - who's coughing and sneezing in that immediate area, that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system, get filtered and come back down again.\" Meanwhile the International Air Transport Association (Iata), which represents airlines, has set out a detailed \"biosecurity roadmap\", which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry. Much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself, but on the time spent in the airport - where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another. It wants that time to be minimised as much as possible. As a result, it is calling for: The actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk - and according to Iata vice president Nick Careem, \"physical distancing on board is not necessary\". The emphasis, he says, should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin, as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas. That could include banning queues for the washrooms. The key message, Mr Careem says is that \"there is no silver bullet, no single measure that can prevent infection\". Dr Tang, meanwhile, says he would fly with precautions. \"If I get on a plane, I'll be wearing a mask. It's not 100% but at least I'll have some protection.\""

        "text": "Bosses who have furloughed staff during the coronavirus crisis will have to start paying a share of the government scheme from August. The furlough scheme is designed to help people put on leave due to the coronavirus outbreak, and to prevent employers having to make mass redundancies. So how does it work and who is eligible? The government is currently paying the wages of more than a quarter of UK jobs through its furlough programme - the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. It puts workers on leave and allows them to stay on the payroll. About 8.4 million workers have been furloughed since March, with the government paying 80% of their salaries up to \u00a32,500 a month. Companies can top up this pay if they choose and must let employees know they have been furloughed. The scheme - backdated to 1 March - opened to applications on 20 April. By the end of May \u00a315bn of claims had been made. It will run until the end of October and is expected to end up costing about \u00a380bn. On 29 May, Mr Sunak announced two changes. From 1 July, businesses can bring furloughed employees back to workplaces part-time, a month earlier than previously announced. It will be down to individual firms to decide what part-time means and pay the wages for that time. They will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work. For example, Mr Sunak said an employer could bring someone back to work two days a week. In that situation, the employer would pay for those days, while the furlough scheme would cover the employee for the other three working days. From 1 August, employers will have to pay national insurance and pension contributions. Furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay. In September, employers will then pay 10% of employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at \u00a32,500 per employee per month before tax, or \u00a3576.92 a week. If employees are not paid set amounts each month - for example if they have returned from maternity leave, or receive top-up pay - you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built in to an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. All the money claimed must be paid to your workers, or to cover their national insurance and pension payments, even if a firm is in administration. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank account, if you are eligible. Claims take about six working days to process. Potentially yes, if your company can't give you work to do because of the coronavirus outbreak. The scheme covers those who were on an employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. This includes full-time and part-time workers, and employees on flexible, zero-hour or agency contracts. You must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and you can be furloughed more than once. If you have been made redundant since 19 March, your former employer can re-hire you under the scheme. But newly hired employees are not eligible. Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than \u00a350,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500. Anyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding for health reasons or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on maternity, paternity, adoption or shared parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage. If you are placed on furlough you can't do any work for your employer. This will change from July onwards when the government says furloughed workers can return on a part-time basis. You can volunteer in the community or even for your company as long as you aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. From July to October, you may be able to work part time, and be furloughed for the remainder of your hours. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to \u00a32,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. Companies don't have to keep on any employees when furlough ends, and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages. The hope is that by the time the scheme ends, restrictions will have lifted and businesses can start paying full salaries again."

        "text": "The self-employed are receiving government support to cover some of the losses they face as businesses struggle in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. Ultimately, it may not be as generous as the scheme for furloughed workers, but it will now extend into the summer, following the latest announcement from Chancellor Rishi Sunak. If they have suffered a loss in income, a taxable grant is being paid to the self-employed or partnerships, worth 80% of their profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month. It is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, and is open to those who were trading in the last financial year, still trading now, and planning to continue doing so this year but who confirm business has been hit by coronavirus. Initially, this was for three months in one lump-sum payment. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment, the chancellor has said, which will cover 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months, so \u00a36,570 in total. This will again be made as a lump sum direct into bank accounts. More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The scheme has been open to those with a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Those who are recently self-employed, having set up since April 2019, will not receive any help under this scheme. This is because they will not have filed a tax return and therefore HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will not know of their self-employed status. Self-employed people can apply for the first grant until 13 July, and the second from August - at a date to be set. They do not need to have received the first to apply for the second. The government's help comes on top of a six-month delay for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Those with the lowest incomes are in line to receive more generous benefits payments, announced previously. The chancellor said those applying for universal credit should be paid within a few days. The chancellor said this will cover 95% of the self-employed who make most of their money from self-employment. This is how it works: Those who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme but will have 80% of their salary covered by the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme if operating through PAYE. There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of \u00a3781 a month. The number has risen fast since the financial crash of a decade ago. About 3.8 million of them may be covered by this scheme. So far, 2.3 million self-employed have signed up to grants totalling \u00a36.8bn. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education. The chancellor also suggested tax breaks for the self-employed, such as lower national insurance may end in the future. These were in place because, for example, the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay, and to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of the self-employed with employees. A plan had already been announced for those who are employed. The government says 80% of gross wages in the private sector, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for those not working and who would otherwise have been laid off will be covered by these grants from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). These was backdated to March and the scheme has been extended to October. The idea is to prevent mass unemployment. Employers will have to make a contribution to these payments from the summer. The self-employment support package is slightly less generous, but the Treasury says this is because, unlike salaried worker, self-employed people are still free to operate if work is available."

        "text": "Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen from Monday, 8 June, if they put in place appropriate safety measures. All routine dental care in England has been suspended since 25 March. The British Dental Association (BDA) has welcomed the announcement but says key questions remain. Currently, any patient with an emergency dental problem is supposed to be referred to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub for treatment. In a letter to all practices, NHS England's chief dental officer, Sara Hurley, said: \"We are asking that all dental practices commence opening from Monday, 8 June for all face-to-face care, where practices assess that they have the necessary IPC and PPE requirements in place.\" The BDA said that while dentists would be relieved by the announcement, the ability of practices to reopen would depend on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). \"It is right to allow practices to decide themselves when they are ready to open. Dentists will be keen to start providing care as soon as is safely possible, but we will need everyone to be patient as practices get up and running,\" said BDA chairman Mick Armstrong. \"Dentists can open their doors but won't be able to provide a full range of care without the necessary kit. Longer term, practices can only stay afloat with ongoing support, while social distancing continues and the costs of providing care are sky high.\" Official data shows there were 12,010 dental practices in the UK in 2017. According to NHS England, almost half of all adults were seen by an NHS dentist in the 24 months up to 31 December 2019. Some practices say it is going to be a challenge to reopen on 8 June. \"We've got a few issues,\" says Sophia Joseph, an NHS dentist practice manager in Sheffield. \"One of the biggest issues is PPE. We were asked to donate our PPE to other causes, like hospitals and care homes. \"Now we're being told to get that PPE back. I'm not sure if we will reopen, as it will be extremely difficult to get the PPE and maintain it,\" she says. At the moment any patient with an emergency dental problem is supposed to be referred to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. More than 550 of these centres have been created to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. However, the BDA has previously warned about problems with the UDC hubs, including PPE shortages, which has left many patients going untreated. Going to the dentist is likely to be a very different experience once practices reopen. Ms Hurley has written to dentists about the sort of measures practices will need to consider before reopening, including: Some dentists are already putting in place new measures. \"We will arrange regular deep-cleanings of the entire surgery, and probably be including UV-light cleaners as well,\" says Alexandra Germain, a dentist based in Marylebone, London. She also says that hand sanitiser, masks and gloves will be mandatory for patients in the waiting area. If symptoms are serious, local dentists can prescribe medication, such as painkillers and antibiotics, over the phone. In such cases, dentists can contact local pharmacies, which can then prepare medication for patients to pick up. If a patient has an urgent dental problem, they should be referred to a UDC hub by their dentist. Other emergency treatment may also be available. For example, some hospitals may offer emergency dental appointments. However, if a patient cannot reach their local dentist then the advice is to use the 111 online service. Follow Tom on Twitter"

        "text": "Durham Police have investigated Dominic Cummings' relocation of his family to Durham during lockdown. They found that when he subsequently drove to Barnard Castle to check his eyesight \"there might have been a minor breach\"  of the law. Mr Cummings has maintained he behaved reasonably and legally throughout the episode. Mr Cummings drove his family to Durham to stay at his father's farm on the evening of 27 March, after his wife fell ill and suspecting that he might soon fall ill. The next day he developed coronavirus symptoms and was self-isolating. By 12 April Mr Cummings was cleared to return to work and wanted to travel back to London. He decided to go for a drive first to see whether he could drive safely. \"My wife was very worried particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease. She did not want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child given how ill I had been.\" He explained that after parking on the outskirts of Barnard Castle town, he felt sick and the family walked \"about 10-15m\" and sat by the riverbank for about 15 minutes. Durham Police have now investigated and said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to or from the town he would have been told to return to his father's property. If he had agreed no further action would have been taken. The police view is that it might have been a minor breach of the regulations because Mr Cummings maintained social distancing - ie stayed more than 2m away from anyone. According to Adam King, a senior criminal barrister at QEB Hollis Whiteman, \"the use of the word 'might' makes clear that it's not the police's ultimate decision whether to determine reasonable excuse, that's for the courts.\" \"However, if the police's view was that it was a reasonable excuse you would expect them to say that, as they do in relation to the drive to Durham,\" he says. Many people have questioned whether it was dangerous to test his ability to drive with his wife and child in the car and said it was a breach of the Highway Code and motoring laws. Others have pointed out that it took place on his wife's birthday. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove earlier defended the trip by saying it was \"consistent with the guidelines\". He also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. \"It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well,\" Mr Gove said. But the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - says \"driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise\" was not likely to be reasonable. When Mr Cummings originally took his family to Durham to stay at a cottage on the family farm, the police view was that the law wasn't broken. \"Durham Constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father's premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020.\" The lockdown has been underpinned by both the law and various sets of government guidelines. The police only deal with the law. That says: \"During the emergency period, no person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse.\" The law gives examples of reasonable excuses such as obtaining necessities, exercise, medical need and travelling to work. But the list is not exhaustive which means there can be reasonable excuses that are not on it. There are lockdown \"rules\" that are in the guidelines but not in the law. When Mr Cummings drove his family to Durham he suspected his wife had coronavirus and the whole family should have been remaining in their home and self-isolating, according to the guidelines. But he said he feared both him and his wife becoming incapacitated and unable to look after their four-year-old. He has cited a section in the advice that says: \"We are aware that not all these measures will be possible if you are living with children, but keep following this guidance to the best of your ability.\" On 2 April, Mr Cummings' son was taken to hospital in an ambulance after he \"threw up and had a bad fever\". The next day his son \"had recovered and seemed back to normal\" and Mr Cummings said he drove to the hospital to pick up his family as \"there were no taxis\". The night before Mr Cummings was so ill he \"could barely stand up\", he said, and his wife's Spectator piece described how he had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs for 10 days. As he had coronavirus symptoms like fever, Mr Cummings was supposed to be isolating. On this car journey, Mr Cummings said he did not get out or have contact with any strangers. But were other forms of transport available? There were taxi firms who were taking patients home from hospital in Durham at that point. However, the government guidance told self-isolating people: \"Do not use public transport or taxis.\" But in March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. Mr Cummings confirmed that his son was tested upon leaving the hospital, but did not receive his negative result until \"a few days later\". So an ambulance could have taken them home. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they \"could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service\" in early April. Mr Cummings was seen running out of 10 Downing Street on 27 March. His wife, Mary Wakefield, in an article for the Spectator magazine about having the virus, wrote: \"My husband did rush home to look after me.\" In his press conference in the Downing Street rose garden, Mr Cummings said his wife was feeling a bit better after a couple of hours. \"There were many critical things at work and she urged me to return in the afternoon and I did.\" Public Health England (PHE) guidance, published on 12 March, stated that along with the infected individual \"all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days\". Mr Cummings returned home again in the evening and spoke with his wife. \"She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever.\" In his prepared statement at the recent press conference Mr Cummings said: \"For years I have warned of the dangers of pandemics. Last year I wrote about the possible threat from coronaviruses and the urgent need for planning.\" Journalists quickly found a blog by the adviser from last year that mentioned SARS a single time. But it was soon established by a bit of internet sleuthing that the blog had been edited to contain this coronavirus reference on the evening of 14 April this year, the day Mr Cummings returned to work from Durham. When originally published it had contained just a link to another article. Mr Cummings has not revealed why he made the edit when he did.

        "text": "People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. The NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. The hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead. Anyone in England with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, with 700 contract tracers at the moment - increasing to 2,000 later. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop you from unknowingly spreading the virus. This means that you should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. The people you live with won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. The tracers can track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day, the government says. It's hoped the system - already used in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany - will slow the spread of coronavirus. The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he was confident the \"vast majority of people\" would do their \"civic duty\" and follow the NHS test and trace instructions - which are currently voluntary. Since then, the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply \"we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house\". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a395.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions. There are fears that many workers will not be able to live on that amount and will be forced to keep working. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has urged the government to introduce \"enhanced\" sick pay. \"There will be people whose work conditions and employment conditions make [self-isolating] difficult for them so they need that security,\" he said. A smartphone app which would automatically alert people that they've been in contact with someone with coronavirus is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight. It was originally due to be rolled out nationwide in mid-May, but the government now says it will be ready ''in the coming weeks''. With Bluetooth switched on, the app would work in tandem with manual tracing - and could help get hold of people who might not personally know the person who has tested positive. The Isle of Wight trial suggests that at the moment, because of lockdown, people have not been spending 15 minutes in the close company of many others - mainly only those with whom they live. Contact tracing has been credited with helping to lift restrictions in other places:"

Families and friends will be able to reunite (outdoors and at a distance), people will be able to play some sports and visit garden centres, and councils are due to reopen their recycling centres. But with Nicola Sturgeon still urging people to \"stay at home\" as much as possible to contain the spread of the virus, life will remain far from normal. So what exactly can people in Scotland do from Friday? Expect a lot of socially-distanced picnics and barbecues this weekend. From Friday, one household can meet up with another household - as long as they are outside in areas like a park or a private garden. Despite weeks apart, they must resist the urge to hug each other as each family must remain two metres (6ft) from each other. Hand-washing and hygiene should also be a priority and people should avoid touching hard surfaces like gates, walls, fences and park benches. In total, the group meeting up should be no larger than eight - so two families-of-four can meet in the park but two households of five cannot. They are being asked to limit their meetings to one household per day, not meeting several families on the same day. And if they are planning to share a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. People will also need to think about the distance they are travelling to meet family and friends. The guidance says we should not go inside other people's homes - so if your destination is so far away that you will need to use someone else's bathroom, you should not go. With a warm weekend forecast, the first minister has given the green light to more outdoor recreation. From Friday, people will be allowed to sunbathe and sit in parks and open areas. They will be permitted to travel locally - by walking or cycling - for recreation, but the government's \"strong advice\" is that they should not go any further than five miles. Ms Sturgeon said she did not want large numbers of people at tourist hotspots or local beauty spots. \"If you go somewhere and find it crowded, change your plans, use your judgement and go somewhere else,\" she said. However, people will also be able to get back to playing on golf courses, as restrictions are lifted on non-contact sports. Other sports which will be allowed include: The Scottish government says it is not an exhaustive list but people must use their own judgement and maintain physical distancing. One-on-one personal training and coaching is also permitted if it is outside and they can keep apart. Businesses like pubs, cinemas, theatres, hairdressers and clothing stores must remain closed during phase one of the lockdown easing. However, garden centres and plant nurseries will be able to open their doors from Friday, as long as they have distancing measures in place. The construction industry will be able to start preparing their sites for reopening in the future. And the government said it would no longer be discouraging drive-through food outlets from re-opening. Businesses which are not obliged by law to remain closed must ensure their employees can remain two metres from each other. Household waste recycling centres will also be allowed to re-open from Monday. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"

        "text": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has said he acted reasonably and legally after driving 260 miles from his home to Durham during lockdown. What did he do and what does the guidance say? 23 March: The prime minister tells the UK public they \"must stay at home\". People are warned not to meet friends or family members they do not live with. Those with symptoms had already been told to self-isolate. 27 March: Mr Cummings is seen leaving 10 Downing Street.  \"I suddenly got a call from my wife who was looking after our four-year-old child. She told me she suddenly felt badly ill.\"  He went home, but after a couple of hours his wife felt better and he returned to work. Guidance: If Mr Cummings believed his wife may have had coronavirus, the guidance was that \"all other household members who remain well must stay at home and not leave the house for 14 days\". Evening: Mr Cummings went on to explain - \"That evening I returned home and discussed the situation with my wife. She was ill. She might have Covid although she did not have a cough or a fever.\" Mr Cummings said many people he worked closely with, including the PM, had had symptoms or were absent with symptoms. He said: \"I thought there was a distinct probability that I had already caught the disease.\" Later:  Mr Cummings drove up to Durham with his family, arriving \"at roughly midnight\". \"I was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London we could reasonably ask to look after our child and expose themselves to Covid. \"My wife had felt on the edge of being able to look after him safely a few hours earlier.\" Mr Cummings did not say that at the point the family drove north his wife was unable to look after their child. Guidance: Stay at home is the simple government advice for households where one or more members have coronavirus symptoms. However, the main advice page says it is not always straightforward when children are involved. It says: \"If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability, however, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.\" Other government advice did not contain this caveat, such as the leaflet drawn up at the end of March to be sent to every house. Nor did the government page on essential travel which said: \"Essential travel does not include visits to second homes... whether for isolation purposes or holidays. People must remain in their primary residence.\" Durham Police said on 28 May that it did not consider that going to Durham had been an offence. The police statement stressed that it was concerned with whether Mr Cummings had breached the regulations, not the general government guidance to \"stay at home\". 28 March: Mr Cummings says he woke up \"in pain and clearly had Covid symptoms, including a bad headache and a serious fever\". 30 March: A No 10 source confirmed Mr Cummings had developed symptoms of the virus and was self-isolating \"at home\". 1 April: Durham Constabulary speak to the father of Dominic Cummings who confirms that his son and family were present at the property. 2 April: During the night, Mr Cummings' four-year-old son \"threw up and had a bad fever\". Following medical advice, an ambulance took the child to hospital. He was accompanied by Mr Cummings' wife. Mr Cummings \"could barely stand up\". 3 April: After being taken to hospital, Mr Cummings' son woke up the next day having recovered. He was tested for coronavirus and his mother, who was with him at the hospital, was told \"they should return home\" (the test result arrived days later and was negative). According to Mr Cummings, there were no taxis so he \"drove to the hospital, picked him up and returned home\". He said he \"did not leave the car or have any contact with anybody on this short trip\". But according to his wife's later article in the Spectator Mr Cummings had a high fever and muscle spasms in his legs throughout this period. Guidance: People with symptoms that may be caused by coronavirus and who do not require hospital treatment are told they \"must remain at home until they are well\". In March and April, the North East Ambulance Service (NEAS) policy was to offer transport for patients leaving hospital with suspected Covid-19 but without a confirmed test result. A spokesperson for Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust, which runs nine hospitals and two accident and emergency units in the area, told the BBC they \"could arrange ambulance transport via North East Ambulance Service\" in early April. 6 April: At some point in the week leading up to this date, Mr Cummings discussed his decision to travel to Durham with the prime minister. \"When we were both sick and in bed,\" he said, \"I mentioned to him what I had done. Unsurprisingly given the condition we were in, neither of us remember the conversation in any detail.\" 4-11 April: Mr Cummings said \"after I started to recover, one day in the second week, I tried to walk outside the house\". He confirmed he, his wife and his son went for a walk into woods owned by his father and it was at this point he was seen by passers-by but his family \"had no interaction with them\". The exact date is not clear but his second week isolating in Durham would have between these two dates. Guidance: Advice concerning outdoor exercise changed during the second week in April, when Mr Cummings and his family walked in the woods. Until 9 April, people with coronavirus symptoms and their household were told they could exercise outdoors. On that date, the PHE advice changed to say \"any exercise should be taken within your home\". A separate NHS guidance page said people isolating could use their gardens. 11 April: Believing he had recovered by this date, albeit \"feeling weak and exhausted\", Mr Cummings said he \"sought expert medical advice\". \"I explained our family's symptoms and all the timings and asked if it was safe to return to work on Monday or Tuesday, seek childcare and so on. I was told that it was safe and I could return to work.\" 12 April: Mr Cummings drives to Barnard Castle, about 25 miles from his parents' home in Durham, with his wife and child. He explained this episode as needing to test his driving was fine before making the long drive back to London. He said he'd been having problems with his vision. Guidance: On 28 May Durham Police said the drive to Barnard Castle \"might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention\". It added that the offence was minor because there did not appear to have been any breach of the social distancing rules. The statement said that if an officer had stopped Mr Cummings on the way to Barnard Castle, they would advised him to return to Durham. The constabulary said it would not be taking retrospective action against him because it would not do so against any other member of the public. There was no mention in the statement of whether Mr Cummings was fit to drive given his concerns about his eyesight. The 1988 Road Traffic Act says: \"If a person drives a motor vehicle on a road while his eyesight is such (whether through a defect which cannot be, or one which is not for the time being, sufficiently corrected) that he cannot comply with any requirement as to eyesight prescribed under this Part of this Act for the purposes of tests of competence to drive, he is guilty of an offence.\" The Highway Code says: \"You MUST report to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) any health condition likely to affect your driving.\" Sir Peter Fahy, former chief constable of Manchester Police, said the drive to Barnard Castle was potentially a criminal offence. \"It's not the way to test your eyesight and put, potentially, other people in danger.\" On Twitter, John Apter, chair of the Police Federation for England and Wales, said: \"If you're feeling unwell and your eyesight may be impaired do not drive your vehicle to test your ability to drive. It's not a wise move.\" Michael Gove also referred to a reason that Mr Cummings did not during his press conference. \"It was part of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) guidance that you could drive at that time in order to take exercise as well.\" In the NPCC guidance referred to by Mr Gove - which was publicised in mid-April - \"driving for a prolonged period with only brief exercise\" was deemed not likely to be reasonable. Mr Cummings and his family walked a few yards and sat by a riverbank for a few minutes. 13 April: Mr Cummings and his family travel back to London. 14 April: Mr Cummings is seen in Downing Street for the first time since 27 March. In his recent press conference Mr Cummings said he had written \"about the possible threat from coronaviruses last year\" but it transpired an old blog was edited on the evening of 14 April to add a short section on this. 19 April: Five days after being in London, The Observer and Mirror report that Mr Cummings is seen again in Durham by an unnamed witness. Mr Cummings says he did not return to Durham and that evidence on his phone proves this. Mr Cummings insisted he did not break the law, saying: \"I believe that in all the circumstances I behaved reasonably and legally, balancing the safety of my family and the extreme situation in Number 10.\" He said \"I don't regret what I did\" and added that \"the rules make clear that if you are dealing with small children that can be exceptional circumstances and the situation I was in was exceptional circumstances\"."

        "text": "As the crisis has unfolded, scientists have discovered more evidence about a strange and worrying feature of the coronavirus. While many people who become infected develop a cough, fever and loss of taste and smell, others have no symptoms at all and never realise they're carrying Covid-19. Researchers say it's vital to understand how many are affected this way and whether \"silent spreaders\" are fuelling the pandemic. When people gathered at a church in Singapore on 19 January, no-one could have realised that the event would have global implications for the spread of coronavirus. It was a Sunday and, as usual, one of the services was being conducted in Mandarin. Among the congregation at The Life Church and Missions, on the ground floor of an office building, was a couple, both aged 56, who'd arrived that morning from China. As they took their seats, they seemed perfectly healthy so there was no reason to think they might be carrying the virus. At that time, a persistent cough was understood to be the most distinctive feature of Covid-19 and it was seen as the most likely way to transmit it. Having no symptoms of the disease should have meant having no chance of spreading it. The couple left as soon as the service was over. But shortly afterwards, things took a turn for the worse, and in a wholly confusing way. The wife started to become ill on January 22, followed by her husband two days later. Because they had flown in from Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, that was no big surprise. But over the following week, three local people also came down with the disease for no obvious reason, leading to one of Singapore's first and most baffling coronavirus cases. Working out what had happened would lead to a new and disturbing insight into how the virus was so successfully finding new victims. \"We were extremely perplexed,\" says Dr Vernon Lee, head of communicable diseases at Singapore's Ministry of Health. \"People who didn't know one another somehow infected each other,\" while showing no sign of illness. This new batch of cases simply did not make sense, according to what was known about Covid-19 back then. So Dr Lee and his fellow scientists, along with police officers and specialist disease trackers, launched an investigation, generating detailed maps showing who was where and when. This involved the very best of the process known as contact tracing - a version of which is getting under way now in the UK. It's seen as a vital system for tracking down everyone involved in an outbreak and helping to stamp it out, and Singapore is renowned for the skill and speed with which this is carried out. Amazingly, within a few days, investigators had spoken to no fewer than 191 members of the church and had found out that 142 of them had been there that Sunday. They quickly established that two of the Singaporeans who became infected had been at the same service as the Chinese couple. \"They could have spoken to each other, greeted each other, during the usual activities of a church service,\" says Dr Lee. That was a useful start and would explain in theory how the infection could have been passed on, apart from one key factor. It did not answer the crucial question of how the virus could have been transmitted by the two Chinese people when at that stage they had shown no indication of having the disease. And on top of that was an even greater puzzle. It was confirmed that the third Singaporean to become infected, a 52-year-old woman, had not been at the same service as the others. Instead she had attended another event in the same church later that day, so how could she have picked up the virus? Investigators resorted to going through the CCTV recordings made at the church that Sunday to search for clues. And they stumbled across something completely unexpected - the woman who'd attended the later service, after the Chinese couple had left, had sat in the seats they had used several hours earlier. Somehow, despite having no symptoms and not feeling ill, the Chinese husband and wife had managed to spread the virus. Maybe they'd had it on their hands and touched the seats, maybe their breath carried the infection and it landed on a surface, it's not clear, but the implications were huge. For Dr Lee, piecing everything together, there was only one possible explanation - that the virus was being passed by people who had it without even realising. This was a revelation that would be relevant the world over because the central message of all public health advice on coronavirus has always been to look out for symptoms in yourself and others. But if the virus was also being spread by people without symptoms, silently and invisibly, how could the disease be stopped? He remembers the moment, while working in his office, when the reality dawned on him. \"Every time you make a scientific discovery, it is like a 'eureka' moment when you realise that this is something important that you've uncovered, through the hard work of many individuals and teams.\" What was revealed was what's known as \"pre-symptomatic transmission\" where someone is unaware of being infected because the cough, fever and other classic symptoms have yet to begin. Along with many others, this study highlighted a critical period of 24-to-48 hours before the visible onset of the disease in which people can be highly infectious, perhaps even their most infectious. Being aware of that is potentially invaluable, because as soon as you realise you're ill then everyone you've been in close contact with can be warned to stay at home. That would mean that they would be isolating during the key phase of infection before their own symptoms start. But exactly how the disease can be transmitted without a cough to project droplets containing the virus is still open to debate. One option is that simply breathing or talking to someone can do the job. If the virus is reproducing in the upper respiratory tract at that time then it's possible that some of it will emerge with each exhalation. Anyone close enough, especially indoors, could easily pick it up. And another potential form of transmission is by touch - the virus gets onto someone's hands and they touch another person or a door handle - or a seat in a church. Whatever the route, the virus is clearly exploiting the fact that people are bound to be less vigilant if they're not aware that they might be infected. This is an even more mysterious scenario, and one that scientists simply have no definitive answer to. It's one thing to know that people can be infectious before their symptoms show, quite another when they become infected but never have any sign of it. This is what's known as being \"asymptomatic\" because you are a carrier of the disease but do not suffer in any way yourself. The most famous case is that of an Irish woman who was working as a cook in New York at the beginning of the last century. Wherever Mary Mallon was employed, in house after house, people became ill with typhoid and at least three, maybe many more, died of it, but she was completely unaffected. Eventually a connection was established and it was confirmed that she was the unwitting spreader of the disease. Reporters dubbed her \"Typhoid Mary\", a label she always resented, but the authorities took no chances and kept her in confinement for 23 years until her death in 1938. Staff nurse Amelia Powell was shocked when she found out that she is asymptomatic. She was at work on her hospital ward at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in April when a doctor rang to give her the result of a swab test. She had been feeling normal and safe behind the personal protective equipment she had to wear while caring for patients with Covid-19. But suddenly all those assumptions were undermined because, to her horror, she had tested positive. \"It was a bit like hearing that someone in the family had passed, it was surreal. \"I thought, 'This can't be right, not me, I'm absolutely fine,'\" says 23-year-old Amelia. She had to leave her post straightaway to go into isolation at home. \"I was worried because I've seen the other side, with patients deteriorating very quickly with it, so I did wonder if this would happen to me.\" But, to her surprise, at no point did she feel unwell. \"I had nothing, literally - I was exercising indoors, eating normally, sleeping normally.\" At the moment it's impossible to know how many cases of infection exist but remain hidden from view. The discovery that Amelia was infected was only revealed because she was part of a study of all the staff at her hospital. It produced the surprising result that as many as 3% of more than 1,000 people were positive while showing no symptoms at the time of the test. An even greater proportion of asymptomatic cases was found on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which had been sailing off the coast of Japan earlier this year. Later branded \"a petri dish for infection\", it had around 700 cases. Researchers found that three quarters of the people who had tested positive had no symptoms. And at a care home in Washington state more than half the residents were positive but had no sign of the illness. Different studies suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many cases are asymptomatic stretching from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that \"there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics\". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, \"perhaps a lot of cases\". The biggest concern of Amelia, the nurse, was that she might have unwittingly transmitted the virus either to those she works with or to the patients who depend on her help. \"I don't think I passed it on because all the colleagues I work with tested negative but it was worrying to think how long I'd been positive for,\" she says. \"But we still don't know if people who are asymptomatic are contagious or not - it's very bizarre and the information about it at the moment is minimal.\" One study in China which found that the number of asymptomatic cases was actually greater than those with symptoms had a warning for the authorities. \"As 'silent spreaders',\" the scientists wrote, \"asymptomatic carriers warrant attention as part of disease prevention and control.\" The team that studied that Diamond Princess reckoned that asymptomatic cases were likely to be less infectious than people with symptoms but even so they're estimated to have caused a significant number of cases. To try to get an answer, scientists in Norwich are pushing for the population of the entire city to be tested. \"Asymptomatic cases may be the 'dark matter' of the epidemic,\" according to Prof Neil Hall, head of the Earlham Institute, a life science research centre, who's leading the initiative. Dark matter is the invisible substance believed to make up most of the matter in the universe, and it's yet to be identified. Prof Hall worries that asymptomatic cases may actually be driving the pandemic, keeping it going despite public health measures. \"If you have people who don't know they're ill while using public transport and health care facilities, inevitably that's going to increase transmission,\" he says. \"Any intervention that's only based on people coming to primary health care when they have symptoms will only deal with half the problem.\" A team of scientists in California believes that not knowing who's carrying the virus without symptoms is the \"Achilles Heel\" of the fight against the pandemic. In their view, the only way to stop the disease from spreading is to find out who's infected regardless of whether they think they are or not. That was also the recommendation of MPs on the Commons Science and Technology Committee in a letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson. They wrote that the risk of asymptomatic transmission has \"a profound consequence for the management of the pandemic\". And they said that anyone looking after vulnerable people - such as health workers or care workers - should be given regular testing. A similar approach is being adopted on a far larger scale in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic is thought to have begun. As many as 6.5 million people there were tested in as little as nine days in a mass screening programme designed to detect the disease - including in those showing no symptoms. As lockdown measures are eased and more people start to use public transport, return to work or go shopping, getting to grips with the invisible risk matters more than ever. At the moment, there is no way of telling who among the growing crowds may be carrying the virus without knowing. That's why governments the world over say it's essential that everyone cooperates with efforts to trace the contacts of anyone infected and then quickly self-isolates. They also advise that the best defence remains social distancing - to keep apart wherever you can. But where that isn't possible, the recommendation is to cover your face, even with a mask that's homemade. When the US government announced this policy, it highlighted the discoveries made in the church in Singapore back in January. The logic is that this is not about protecting yourself, it's about protecting others from you, in case you're infected but don't know it. Many health professionals worry that masks might distract people from hand washing or social distancing, or increase the risk of contamination if they're clumsily handled. But more and more governments, most recently that of the UK, have become convinced of the benefits. Not that face coverings will halt the pandemic on their own. But because there's still so little we know about asymptomatic transmission, almost anything is worth a try. When you talk to intensive care doctors across the UK, exhausted after weeks of dealing with the ravages of Covid-19, one phrase emerges time after time: \"We've never seen anything like this before.\""
