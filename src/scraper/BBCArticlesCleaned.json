        "text": "there have been warnings coronavirus may be starting to spread again in the north west and the south west of england some scientists say the r number is creeping up across the country and may have surpassed one   the point at which the epidemic takes off again   in these regions tameside council has strongly advised schools not to reopen on monday the government insists the number is not above one anywhere in the country so what is going on how worried should we be and what does it mean for lifting lockdown it is the number of people each infected person on average passes the virus onto if the r is three then 10 people would infect 30 others but if r is 05 those 10 people would infect only five an r of one is the crucial threshold anything lower and an epidemic is in decline but if it goes higher then cases increase exponentially that r is increasing across england one team at public health england phe and the university of cambridge says this has been the clear pattern in their data since 11 may when restrictions in england were eased their findings suggest were now balanced on the edge of a knife both the north west and south west are just above one but all regions are straddling one said dr paul birrell one of the researchers but this is just one mathematical model and there is huge uncertainty in the figures the phe data gives a figure between 072 and 12 for london the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine agrees the south west may be above one but paints a more optimistic view of the rest of england and their r number for the north west is just 08 overall i would say we see r creeping up dr sebastien funk from the london school told the bbc they also say the r number is 08 in wales scotland and northern ireland it would be easy to say yes but the reality is confusing and it is important to understand what is driving any changes in r its complicated the reasons are many and difficult to untangle dr funk told me the most straightforward explanation is that the virus is genuinely spreading more as the phe report says we believe that this is probably due to increasing mobility and mixing between households and in public and workplace settings but due to a counter intuitive quirk of maths lockdown can be a success cases fall and r still goes up if cases collapse in the community   which appears to be happening   but come down more slowly in care homes and hospitals   which we also think is happening   then these areas will drag the r number back up even though the situation is improving and when you get to low levels of infection all the estimates become more uncertain and that too can make r appear higher its a weird thing about r it tells you the rate of change and once all the way down you cant have r at a low level said dr funk there is no perfect way of measuring r the government takes advice from multiple modelling groups including the two above which all estimate the figure from different angles some give more positive others more negative views on r it is the job of sage the governments group of science advisors led by chief science advisor sir patrick vallance to come to an overall view the official position is the r for the whole of the uk is between 07 and 09 sage sources say in their view there is no region that has an r above one but some areas are very close sir patrick has consistently and publicly warned there is little room for manoeuvre in easing lockdown as r is on the cusp of one john edmunds professor of infectious disease modelling at the london school of hygiene & tropical medicine says it could take some time to identify a rising r number he told bbc radio 4s today programme on saturday the delay is really concerning numbers are relatively small our measures are quite crude so it would take some time to detect an increase in say the reproduction number he said there are still quite a few infections in the community id prefer to see fewer infections in the community one in 600 is still quite a high rate so i think it would be safer if we drove that rate right down before we ease things too much the first point is the number of cases is vital too a high r is more of a problem when there is a lot of virus around r shouldnt be taken in isolation about the current level of threat said dr birrell the south west has always had relatively few cases   currently 778 infections a day according to phe however dr birrell says the north west   4170 infections a day   is more worrying also relaxing lockdown is putting pressure on the r number to increase some school children are back in the classroom businesses are reopening and we can see more people while maintaining social distance the full effect of this is expected to be seen in the official data in the coming weeks dr funk said were pretty close to r equals one whichever way you look at it were lifting restrictions and if we see a sustained r greater than one then we need to do something about it a day above one doesnt concern me a couple of weeks does the next stage of controlling coronavirus will depend on getting a detailed picture of what is happening up and down the country the plan is to use local lockdowns that target clusters of cases that may be linked to a business or a care home but this will require an even more precise picture of what is going on than in these models

is likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than war he told the audience his prescient words picked up some coverage at the time including from the bbc   but largely went unheeded but now the video of this talk has now been viewed more than 64 million times   with many people more interested in the reasons behind that speech than the talk itself some accuse of him of leading a class of global elites others believe he is leading efforts to depopulate the world still more accuse him of making vaccines mandatory or even attempting to implant microchips into people there are myriad conspiracies surrounding bill gates said rory smith from fact checkers first draft news he is this kind of voodoo doll that all these communities are pricking with their own conspiracies and it is unsurprising he has become the voodoo doll   because he has always been the face of public health theories falsely linking bill gates to the coronavirus were mentioned 12 million times on television or social media between february and april according to a study by the new york times and zignal labs much of the content is posted to public facebook groups from where it is shared millions of times first draft news has also found that chinese viral video site tiktok is becoming a new home for such conspiracies the bbcs anti disinformation team has been researching some of the more outlandish ones so how did the founder of microsoft who has poured billions into global healthcare from the philanthropic foundation he runs with his wife melinda become the bogeyman of covid 19 conspiracy theorists prof joseph uscinski a political scientist at the university of miami and author of books on conspiracy theories believes it is simply because he is rich and famous conspiracy theories are about accusing powerful people of doing terrible things he told the bbc the theories are basically the same just the names change before bill gates it was george soros and the koch brothers and the rothchilds and the rockefellers and while the majority of conspiracy theories die on the vine the ones that endure are those that offer big villains and address issues that people care about it should come as no surprise that rich people and big corporations are being accused of conspiring to put chips in our necks because that is a thing we fear he said this has been the ammo of conspiracy theories for a long long time while he thinks such conspiracies have no tether to the truth whatsoever people still seem to be falling for them more than a quarter of all americans and 44% of republicans believe that bill gates wants to use a covid 19 vaccine to implant microchips under peoples skin according to a survey from yahoo news and yougov mr smith thinks that there is often a kernel of truth which is taken way out of context so for example the bill and melinda gates foundation did fund a study conducted by the massachusetts institute of technology last year which looked at the possibility of storing a patients vaccination history in a pattern of dye it would be invisible to the naked eye and could be delivered under the skin at the same time as a vaccine it is difficult to ascertain the root of conspiracy theories   but its thought the internet is making them spread further before the internet they were self contained and existed only in their own echo chambers or bubbles within certain communities but the internet allows them to travel across political lines between communities so i think there is much more scope to mainstream conspiracy theories than before the internet said mr smith and he added conspiracy theories had particularly flourished during this global pandemic because people were psychologically vulnerable this crisis is unprecedented in size and scope and the advice shifts as new studies are published there are large areas of uncertainty and humans abhor uncertainty he said to deal with it individuals resort to something he calls collective sense making we grab onto any information to inject some sort of sense and order and that is when the rumour mill starts conspiracy theories   and notably bill gates conspiracy theories   fill these informational vacuums the bill and melinda gates foundation which has committed $300m \u00a3240m to combat covid 19 has remained sanguine about the barrage of false claims in a statement to the bbc it said were concerned about the conspiracy theories being spread online and the damage they could cause to public health at a time like this when the the world is facing an unprecedented health and economic crisis its distressing that there are people spreading misinformation when we we should all be looking for ways to collaborate and save lives right now one the best things we can do to stop the spread of covid 19 is spread the facts in an interview with the bbc bill gates expressed surprise that he had become the figurehead of such theories it is troubling that there is so much craziness when we develop the vaccine we will want 80 percent of the population to take it and if they have heard it is a plot and we dont have people willing to take the vaccine that will let the disease continue to kill people im kind of surprised some of it is focused on me we are just giving money away we write the cheque and yes we do think about lets protect children against disease but it is nothing to do with chips and that type of stuff you almost have to laugh sometimes"

school in lockdown i hadnt put on my uniform in months and it felt strange i couldnt wear my tie   the school said it was to avoid any infection from ties dragging across different surfaces i could only take a bottle of water in with me and no bag when we arrived at the school gates we had to queue 2m apart my mum shouted hi and are you all right to some of the other parents but there was no chatting before i entered the school building i had to wash my hands for 20 seconds we all had our own desks and were sitting apart from everyone else once you had chosen your desk that was yours until the end of term you couldnt sit anywhere else there were nine children in my class today the maximum we can have in our class bubble is 10 and it was made up of a variety of students from different year 6 classes i had a different teacher and teaching assistant they didnt wear masks but kept their distance and stayed at the front of the class at times they would say time for hand sanitising the teachers have put up some rules showing what you should do inside the school building one is that we have to follow a one way system when we are walking around the school to make sure we keep our distance the teachers say stretch out your arms and if you are almost touching someone you have to back up or go forwards if we are going somewhere you can only start walking when the person in front of you has taken three steps we had maths and english today and we ate our lunch in the classroom when it came to outdoor play the playground had been divided up into squares and you could choose three or four friends from your class to be in a square with you while still social distancing once you had chosen you would stay with the same people for outdoor play until the end of term i looked at two of my friends it took just one glance and we knew the three of us would be in a square together four year 6 children from schools in england explain their feelings on going back to school including their worry about spreading the virus the difficulty of not being able to hug a friend and getting back into happiness when we used to play basketball on the court we could pass the ball to each other with our hands i miss that in the square i was in today we had tennis balls and i could bowl the ball but id have to go and pick it up myself no one could catch it if you were in the square with the footballs you could kick the ball to someone but not touch the ball with your hands or tackle anyone four of my close friends have not returned to school we had pe today and so i wore my pe kit to school this morning it was colder on the way to school and i had goosebumps our teacher says the virus can stay on clothing so we cannot change into our sports kit at school like we normally would we wore it there and stayed in it until we went home we were outside more today we had science and we walked in a single line around the school grounds always staying three steps behind someone looking at the habitats of insects in our pe lesson we had a competition between different groups you all had your own tennis ball and one of the things we had to do was bowl the ball and if you hit the wicket your group got a point we also practised our fast footwork by weaving in and out of cones my favourite lesson is maths i would like to be a computer engineer in the future i usually go to maths club after school on tuesdays and wednesdays but all clubs have been cancelled i preferred what school was like before the lockdown but im getting more used to the feel of how it is now even though you have to keep your distance from your friends you can still chat to them and we have invented what we call invisible high fives   its like a normal high five but into the air we did two new subjects today   history and art in history we learnt all about the history of london in art we came up with ideas based on artist barbara hepworths sculpture my design was a leaf and in the middle was a hole where the sunlight pointed through one of my friends didnt come to school today so there were only two of us in our square for outdoor play were really good friends and i missed him but i still had my other friend there we dont see anyone else from the other classes during the day as they do different activities at different times and they enter and leave the school at different times too i used to go to school and come home by myself but with the new routine my mum takes and collects me she says its like it was when i was back in year 1 school finishes 30 minutes earlier than it did before the lockdown and mum says its quieter at the school gates when she takes me and picks me up every year in summer we would have sports day and it was good because we got to do different competitions in different groups but we wont have sports day this year this is my last year at primary school there would usually be a huge party for us at the end of term and wed take part in year 6 productions its a shame i wont get to experience these even though its been different this week its been nice being back at school we had design and technology today and learnt about mechanics and we wrote a description of the main character in a book we have been reading called rooftoppers in pshce personal social health and citizens education we learnt about the riots that have been happening in the us after the death of george floyd it was my turn in the football square on the field today in outdoor play it was good to be back playing football my friend wasnt in school again but he says hell be back next week mum says the school set up is beginning to feel more normal she is really impressed at how the teachers always make sure everyone sticks to the social distancing she is looking forward to when everything can go back to how it used to be and being able to chat at the school gates again but she says she knows its going to take a while we had a half day at school today the teachers have said the school will be shut on friday afternoons for a deep clean we went into school in our pe kit again like we did on tuesday but we didnt have pe   its to give everyone an extra day for our uniforms to be washed im looking forward to going back to school again on monday im also looking forward to secondary school in september mum says shes excited for my new adventure in year 7 too she says shes really proud of me my mum has a message for any other students who are planning to go back to school again for the first time next week i know its a bit scary for some people but just be open minded and just look on the bright side she says and try to be calm and try to be positive as told to lucy wallis all photographs courtesy of carls mother or

any critical feedback the prettier the picture the better no matter what laws rules had to be broken to create it the few people who are willing to voice their critical feedback are usually ignored told they are just being negative or that they need to stop policing \u201cart\u201d  if you think adults deserve to be coddled to have their hands held or should be ignored when they repeatedly lie and break the law there are plenty of accounts you can follow that conform to the status quo and take that approach @publiclandshateyou isn\u2019t one of those accounts i call it like i see it is the approach here salty sarcastic and snarky yes is it effective yes i think it is i understand that no one is perfect people screw up i screw up and that\u2019s ok life is a learning process however when the response to a harmful mistake is excuses ignorance and lying rather than learning and growth there needs to be a level of accountability unfortunately ig & fb have decided that preservation of our environment is not a priority and have chosen not to provide a way to report illegal harmful actions on our public lands that leaves it up to us the peers of people who post harmful actions to voice our opinions and make it known that we don\u2019t support illegal and harmful actions on our public lands the goal isn\u2019t to bully insult or make people feel bad but to show with polite and educational dialogue that we don\u2019t support illegal and harmful behavior on our public lands the goal is to change the social norms around what is acceptable on our public lands and that change requires a lot of voices change never happens by following the status quo people have to get out there and stick their heads out is that going to make some people uncomfortable yes but our public lands don\u2019t have their own voice so that means people like you and i need to step up and be that voice speak out for what we believe in no one is going to do it for you and our public lands are not going to protect themselves a post shared by  our public lands hate you @publiclandshateyou on may 15 2019 at 621pm pdt end of instagram post  by publiclandshateyou one man has made it his mission to stop bad behaviour by social media stars in national parks and public spaces but not everyones happy with his methods theres a picture of me just a few months old and in a backpack with my parents taking me for a hike through a national forest where i grew up says steve and as ive grown my love of the outdoors has grown but also growing is steves frustration with influencers trampling over his beloved open spaces to get that perfect photograph i drew the conclusion between the rise of this disrespect and the rise of instagram and social media he says speaking to the bbc from a mostly rural area in the western us so i decided to start an instagram account to fight fire with fire steve   weve agreed not to use his real name because of threats hes received   started an account called public lands hate you in 2018 it wasnt long before it went viral in early 2019 heavy rains came to southern california including walker canyon a chunk of public land an hours drive east of los angeles it was a wet year for us recalls brian tisdale mayor of the nearby city of lake elsinore and when you get rain it creates the perfect conditions perfect conditions that is for an explosion of wildflowers it was a sea of orange just every hill was covered with flowers it was absolutely stunning says mayor tisdale  people started pulling off the road to come and look at the flowers it started this social media frenzy he says download the trending podcast from the bbc world service the hashtag was #superbloom attracted by social media   and old school media as well   walker canyon became a tourist attraction causing queues on the nearby highway and gridlock in lake elsinore itself influencers   and some unfamous social media users as well   took photos while trampling the flowers going off the trail and picking the blooming poppies all of which are against the parks rules at one point authorities were even forced to temporarily close walker canyon the crowds kept coming until the flowers faded away into summer the superbloom sent steves account viral his fans sent in dozens of photos of people in walker canyon breaking the rules he now has more than 75000 followers   ironically making him something of an influencer himself hes not alone other accounts do similar work   they have names like instawrecked national parks hate you and keeping iceland beautiful steve emphasises that he always tries to work with people rather than against them he says he first tries to approach instagrammers privately to get them to add educational captions to their photos or take down particularly egregious shots he has won some converts jae fusz is an instagrammer who flocked to another california superbloom this year   in antelope valley north of la i was like this is amazing its so pretty like it was the best time ever he says he posted a few shots on instagram including this one california gurl \ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1\ud83e\udde1 a post shared by  jaefusz @jaefusz on apr 28 2020 at 929am pdt end of instagram post  by jaefusz the backlash was immediate steve got in touch in the comments section calling him up on picking and walking over the flowers jae thought about it   and posted an apology each year hundreds of people come and destroy these flowers he wrote im posting this in hopes of educating the next person who goes to take photos near them and not trample over the flowers like i did not everyone is so accommodating if steve is blocked or ignored he reposts the photo and contacts companies who sponsor the offending instagrammer the most efficient tool in our fast paced and ever evolving social media culture is calling out illegal and harmful behaviour he argues and unsurprisingly thats earned him a few opponents ania bonyetska works with her husband to post stunning images from all across the globe she has over 100000 instagram followers a lot of our work revolves around travel and taking photos in beautiful places she explains walker canyons 2019 superbloom was she says a must see she visited and shared three posts including this one they got the attention of steves fans while ania says she never got a message from him steve says he did try to get in touch anias photo went up on public lands hate you as soon as they posted ania recalls we got a flood of incoming hate she is adamant she didnt do anything wrong and she filed a copyright complaint to instagram to get her photo taken down from public lands hate you as much as i agree with the underlying message i dont think that they are effective she contends i think that they create insane division of opinions steve says he discourages harassment and tells his followers to stay respectful but when it comes to his core mission hes not backing down his latest project is a bad influencer list   a roll call of repeat offenders the idea is for it to be a resource to companies as well as a deterrent to influencers who use our public lands in illegal and harmful ways he says word is getting around in influencer circles that theres this grassroots group\u2026 who are fed up with their behaviour he notes the tide is still headed in the wrong direction but it is starting to turn additional reporting by mike wendling is there a story we should be investigating email us"

        "text": "ally all lives matter white privilege these are just a few of the words and phrases you may have seen or heard in discussions about racial inequality after the death of george floyd many of these terms about race and activism are controversial    and people often have different ideas about what certain phrases mean their life experiences will also affect how they define them so radio 1 newsbeats been chatting with a couple of people for their interpretations and perspectives kehinde andrews is professor of black studies at birmingham city university director of the centre for critical social research founder of the organisation of black unity and co chair of the black studies association jt flowers is a 26 year old american rapper student and activist living in the uk white privilege   a term some find upsetting and offensive   refers to the concept that people have basic rights and benefits simply because they are white it doesnt mean they havent suffered hardship or that they dont have a tough life   just that their colour hasnt made it harder jt feels some people get defensive about this term because its misunderstood you might be a white person and still be poor with a lack of access to education or face a language barrier in the workplace it doesnt mean you cant be disadvantaged in other ways he tells newsbeat it just means with respect to that one particular thing   your race and skin colour   you do have the luxury of not being able to think about it it means having the luxury of being able to step outside without fearing that youre going to be discriminated against or oppressed in any way because of the colour of your skin he says the most recent statistics from the home office and ministry of justice show kehinde believes the benefits of whiteness can be psychological and that there is a benefit to being white because youre not treated in the same way there are different dimensions to it some people have more privilege kehinde tells us the phrase white privilege was first written by the famous black civil rights activist william du bois in the 1930s to explain the way white workers in america benefited from segregation and the colour of their skin content is not available many argue black people have to deal with an extra burden of worrying about how they will be treated because of how people perceive them speaking in a special show on bbc radio 1xtra dj ace said as a huge black man with a beard people find him frightening i have to live with this all day every day and in every scenario im aware my aesthetic is scary to some white people sometimes i might tone it down and that embarrasses me if i see a white woman coming down the street i might cross so she feels more comfortable white saviour is usually used to describe somebody who appears to think certain communities need saving it is a concept thats rooted in this idea that marginalised communities particularly the black community isnt empowered enough to liberate themselves says jt he says in online spaces and activism its usually used to point out when someone takes it upon themselves to speak on behalf of black people or marginalised people sometimes without understanding the circumstances jt says ideally people should create space for black people to speak for themselves last year stacey dooley was criticised for making a film in uganda for comic relief and posting a picture on instagram of her with a black child at the time mp david lammy said the world does not need any more white saviours stacey dooley insisted there was nothing sinister about what she did   and has since said she wouldnt change what she did following the row comic reliefs co founder the writer and director richard curtis said the charity would use fewer celebrities in their films and be very careful to give voices to people who live in the areas being highlighted at first glance this seems a contradiction to white saviour jt describes an ally as a person whos willing to stick their neck out and stand up for whats right when they see something going wrong often this is someone who is outside of the community they are trying to help   so in this case it might be white people who want to support the black community its what can white people do says kehinde jt believes an ally needs to do more than act like a white saviour and take on some risk and bear the cost of actually standing up for justice what were trying to do in the states is push the dialogue to a place where people begin to consider what it would look like to be an accomplice he believes the best way to be an accomplice is to create space for black people to speak for themselves all lives matter this is often used as a response to the phrase black lives matter   the feeling from some people that all lives should be included in the conversation around race jt believes people who say it may not understand what the black lives matter phrase means imagine your house is on fire and somebody comes up to you and says hey all houses matter your response would be along the lines of yes but your house isnt on fire so if all houses matter and your house is fine then why is it so much to ask you to care when my house is burning down jt believes we live in a society where   at present black lives arent valued in the same way that white lives are silence = violence again a controversial phrase which basically means the best way to address an issue is to speak about it   and staying quiet means you agree with whats going on its effectively just the idea that the status quo our everyday reality at present is a violent one for black people claims jt refusing or failing to speak out on that is to be ok with things as they are you dont have to post something on social media in order to act and live your life in an anti racist way if you see something going wrong on a street you can speak up and do something jt realises many people can feel uncomfortable on speaking out or may feel its not their place if you notice that you feel unequipped to have conversations with people about race you can take the time to educate yourself and speaking out doesnt have to mean posting on social media it can simply be about starting to talk honestly about race with those closest to you you can have conversations with your friends and family members follow newsbeat on

newborn twins needing a feed they came home yesterday after being at the hospital for the past few days and are on a feeding plan to help them gain weight as they were born nearly five weeks early which means they will need formula in addition to breast milk we never intended to use formula as breast milk is a lot cheaper but when it comes to health there is no discussion needed weve had a new tesco open close by so i take a walk to see if the formula is in stock and how much it costs whilst also taking the opportunity to use their coffee machine they have the formula but its slightly more expensive than our usual shop so i do not purchase it i do pick up a coffee a red bull a couple of croissants for our other two children and some bacon for \u00a3785 1230 we have a visit from the community midwife to see the twins everything is ok and both gained some weight going to come back again in two days to make sure all ok rest of the day is spent tidying our house with six in has suddenly gotten a whole lot messier the twins are settling in and getting used to the new noisier surroundings generated by their older brothers i purchase the formula from sainsburys where it is \u00a31050 total spend \u00a31835 700 i check my bank account and see the direct debit for the gas and electricity has been taken today \u00a34284 were using slightly less than this so the account is

arrival but it does feel like something is missing let alone \u00a3200 less in my pay to help with this we have taken the option of a mortgage holiday which is saving us \u00a3627 a month 1130 we take a walk to the park for a picnic with a detour to the shop for supplies \u00a31995 i always make sure i scan my nectar card app as my points balance is worth over \u00a355 hoping to have this close to \u00a3100 in time for christmas 1600 i plan to laminate the hallway but when i start i realise ive lost my hammer i rip out the old skirting board and clean up before going to buy a new one its caspers birthday on friday and rebekah asks me to pick up some things for his party so with these a new hammer some other bits and a couple of new t shirts ive spent \u00a35481 when i return i tell her to never send me shopping again on my own i always seem to buy more than intended total spend \u00a311760 1100 the community midwife arrives and indie has gained a lot of weight but eden is still the same were advised to keep to the feeding plan and she will return to check again on friday 1330 during lockdown we decluttered and listed a few items on ebay a nintendo wii sells for \u00a336 so rory and i take a walk to the post o\ufb03ce we nip into the shop \ufb01rst for a drink and a sneaky chocolate bar \u00a3210 i tell him that hes not to tell his brother or mum postage and packaging costs \u00a31449 and its on its way to its new owners 1700 im informed i will be returning to work on 8 june this is a surprise as i wasnt expecting to be back till july but the arcade i manage is being classed as a non essential shop i have mixed emotions probably more so because of the surprise at being allowed to open i pass the message on to my team who reassuringly respond with excitement 1730 i dont usually drink alcohol at home but seeing friends having drinks tempts me \u00a31880 and a case of beers later and drinks for rebekah and the boys were out in the garden total spend \u00a33539 total made \u00a33600 1000 i have a busy day planned today i agreed to help my mums partner by moving a load of mixed concrete for him from a wagon when i finish theres a kfc close by which doesnt look busy so i pop by and have a \ufb01llet stacker meal which is \u00a3659 1600 on to the next job \ufb01nishing the laminate \ufb02ooring at home some di\ufb03cult cuts to do round the stairs doorway and piping but the job is complete and im happy with how it has turned out 1800 need to pick up party food for caspers birthday tomorrow i cant remember the last time i \ufb01lled the car up and it comes to \u00a35814 usually this would cost close to \u00a370 every couple of weeks so love the low oil prices then to the supermarket where i spend \u00a316153 on food tableware party supplies and some tiny baby clothes as the girls are not \ufb01tting their up to one month out\ufb01ts i spend the rest of the evening building a go kart whilst my partner wraps the presents weve been hiding in the wardrobe total spend \u00a322626 its party day casper is turning four today and what a strange time to be in it would have been his \ufb01rst real party with pre school friends but sadly not going to be the case to try and make the day special we found a bouncy castle company still operating and ordered one for the garden 700 no surprise with the early start the birthday boy jumps on to our bed super excited whilst this blog is about money there is nothing quite as valuable as seeing that excited smile on your childs face 800 the bouncy castle arrives and is in\ufb02ated they disinfect the castle prior to leaving and we pay them \u00a355 for the day the boys waste no time in jumping on 1100 the community midwife arrives to weigh the twins again both have put on weight enough for no further additional visits with the next being at 21 days 1130 so throughout the day lots of text messages and phone calls arranging times for visitors to bring presents for casper whilst complying with social distancing measures certainly a different type of party than were used to however all is worth it especially when the birthday boy says its the best birthday ever 2000 after a tiring day a chinese has been ordered 2180 no way either of us are cooking tonight total spend \u00a37680 more blogs from the bbcs my money series 1215 as i am soon returning to work i draft up some rotas ready for the reopening it will be strange going back after so long and still so many questions will we be busy how will customers react to the changes and most importantly will my team and myself stay safe 1330 a further diy task today the glamorous job of sealing a toilet base two young boys tend to miss however all doesnt go to plan as one of the screws is damaged after an hour of trying to remove i begrudgingly order a screw extractor and some screws for click and collect which comes to \u00a31157 get home but still no luck i clean as much of the area and scrub underneath as much as i can then seal the base disappointed at a job half done and wasted money 1830 the day is wrapped up with a conference call to discuss fundraising ideas for lutterworth town fc who i am the club secretary for and a night on the sofa in front of the telly total spend \u00a31157 a quick look at todays forecast another hot day on the cards so we decide to have a barbecue 1230 off to the supermarket to pick up some coal drinks and food to cook and prepare \u00a34360 spent and plenty to enjoy 1400 the bbq is going well sun is shining and the boys are playing nicely together and the girls have been sleeping most of the time 2000 so after a relaxing chilled out day me and rebekah talk about the crazy week weve had this coming week we need to decide what to do as we have the option of sending rory back to school from 8 june it seems like everything is going back to normal total spend \u00a34360 this week was by no means a normal week normally we would have done a weekly shop maybe filled the car with fuel made another couple of trips to the shop and spent around \u00a3150 \u00a3200 being on furlough and im sure others can relate has left me a lot of newfound free time i feel this has assisted in making the weekly spend creep up to help the days go by i dont know how i would class myself with spending on the one hand i always look for the cheapest deals and have no problem in not buying something there and then because its the easy option but on the other hand i do tend to put a few non essential items in the basket this my money exercise has certainly opened my eyes to what i actually do spend however despite spending almost double on our usual week this week has created memories to last a lifetime and you just cant put a price on that were looking for more people to share what they spend their money on if youre interested please email mymoney@bbccouk or get in touch via our my money world facebook group or if you live in the uk please join our my money uk facebook group and well aim to contact you"

mentioning the virus suggests deaths had reached more than 48000 by 22 may when looking at deaths over and above the expected number by this time of year the toll rises to almost 62000 by the same

end of january but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of march the uk has the highest official death toll in europe and the second highest in the world however the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons on sunday the government announced a further 77 deaths although there tend to be fewer deaths reported at weekends this is the lowest number of daily deaths reported since lockdown began the majority of the uks deaths have been in england with more than 36000 so far   about 90% of the total for the uk in scotland the official government figure for deaths is 2415 but data on death registrations from the national records of scotland nrs suggests it had reached nearly 4000 by 31 may in wales the death toll stands at 1398 while there have been 537 deaths in northern ireland there were no new deaths reported in scotland or northern ireland on sunday this is the first time since the beginning of the pandemic that scotland has recorded no new deaths and only the second time in northern ireland although officials have cautioned against reading too much into the figures because of the lag in reporting deaths at weekends this weeks figures from the ons show the overall death total in the uk for the week to 22 may had fallen but was still above normal for the time of year research by public health england phe has found that people from ethnic minorities have a disproportionately higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white british ethnicity but it is still not clear why   the study did not look at occupations or obesity which are also known to be high risk factors most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly with nhs england figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80 about 25% of all coronavirus related deaths have been among care home residents according to the ons but the latest data suggests that has now stabilised the r number is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to if r is below one then the number of people contracting the disease will fall if it is above one the number will grow the scientific advisory group for emergencies known as sage believes the r number across the whole of the uk is currently between 07 and 09 that estimate is the same for scotland and northern ireland while it is between 07 and 10 in england and wales however new research produced by phe and cambridge universitys mrc biostatistics unit suggests the r number has increased across england in recent weeks the model found it is highly likely that r remains below 1 in most regions but said it is at 1 in the south west and just above 1 in the north west dr yvonne doyle public health englands medical director said an increase was to be expected as we gradually move out of lockdown sages estimate for the uk figure is based on several different models including those produced by phe and cambridge each uses different methods and assumptions and gives a different set of regional values for r the government has said that the r number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased the number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in april despite an increase in the number of tests being carried out and the seven day rolling average shows a clear downward trend a further 1326 cases were announced on sunday however estimates by the ons suggest there could be nearly 6000 cases per day in england alone   not including cases in hospitals or care homes   where people either show no symptoms or have mild symptoms and are not tested for the virus cases were originally concentrated in london the midlands and the north west but wales and parts of the north east have also had a high proportions of cases going forward health secretary matt hancock has raised the possibility that there could be local lockdowns to control the spread of the virus the number of people in hospital with covid 19 has been gradually declining since a peak over easter on friday the government said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus had fallen to 7080   down 15% from the same time last week however the picture is different across the uks nations and regions with numbers falling faster

be improved there were 141123 tests in the 24 hours to 0900 on sunday according to government figures"

        "text": "as the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus scientists have another target in their sights   the superspreading event when one person infects many others and there is a new number thats key to understanding why that happens during the pandemic there has been a focus on the reproduction or r number this is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to on average however not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people some may self isolate and infect nobody while others go about their life and infect many people this is where the k number is useful it measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects the smaller the k number is the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is this means more superspreaders each individually infecting higher numbers of people about 10 15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections according to an expert dr adam kucharski of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine lshtm says typically what happens is a lot of people dont give the infection to anyone and then theres a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five 10 20 people potentially infected and we saw that even quite early on with covid covid 19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies how infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person including but it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events if someone when theyre most transmissible happens to go to an all day meeting with a large number of people and then go out for dinner afterwards you may well see a superspreading event dr kucharski says if that person happened to have an evening at home it might not have generated any transmission scientists have been keeping track of clusters of covid 19 since the pandemic began dr gwen knight from lshtm says we found that many of the settings are what we expected so care settings   hospitals and care homes   unfortunately are coming up and also cruise ships which is something we know from other infectious diseases but she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places   meat processing plants choirs bars and gyms all of these involve being indoors in close contact with others for prolonged periods of time but dr knight says there is another common thread these settings are likely to be loud settings and obviously that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do she says there is the hypothesis that because its loud and youre expelling more or faster air it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky there were several clusters linked to fitness classes in south korea and more were linked to zumba classes than to pilates classes so it might be that youre engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper as opposed to a more gentle breathing for example dr muge cevik of the university of st andrews says not all activities not all environments have the same risk of infection so for example the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors outdoors generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by   but that would be lower risk we could say the transmission risk is negligible whereas if you spend a whole day together in a big group in a park and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact less than 2m 6ft the risk is lower than being indoors   but there is still risk hand washing social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential she says strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus but as infections decrease and the world opens up scientists say a more targeted approach is needed dr cevik says we need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact tracing focus but if we can avoid these superspreading events and the environments and activities associated with them you can decrease almost 80% of infections and thats huge follow rebecca on twitter"

advice remains stay at home as much as possible but some non contact outdoor sport is allowed   although rules vary across the uk people in england can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households in scotland people from two households in groups of up to eight people can exercise outside together this means for example that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries as long as people stay 2m 6ft apart and practise good hand hygiene however small sided or full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions individual sports permitted in england if social distancing guidelines are followed include athletics golf horse riding and tennis where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household tennis can also be played in scotland and northern ireland   but not yet in wales however golf can be enjoyed everywhere more than two people can now meet outside across the uk in england groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside in parks or private gardens in scotland two separate households   up to a maximum of eight people   can meet outdoors ideally travelling no more than five miles in wales any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside as in scotland families should aim to travel no more than five miles beauty spots remain closed in northern ireland groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors children are included in the headcount for groups meeting in england scotland and northern ireland in wales two large families can meet   as long as each of them lives at a single address and remember social distancing guidelines   with people from different households remaining 2m 6ft apart from each other   still apply across the whole of the uk socially distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible for many people who want to see their friends and family prime minister boris johnson has warned people in england it remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families other than to access the garden or use the toilet overnight stays are also still not permitted hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority if you use the toilet while visiting another home you should clean any surfaces you have touched prof chris whitty the uk governments chief medical adviser said if you were to do something like a barbecue remember that passing things from one person to another if you havent washed your hands you can pass the virus that way the guidelines in scotland say that for a barbecue each household should bring their own food cutlery and crockery the rules in wales so far say you can eat while out on a walk run or cycle but first minister mark drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an invitation to go into a garden have a few beers and start mixing in a way that potentially harms you or other people people with certain underlying health conditions or who are pregnant or aged over 70 are deemed to be clinically vulnerable if you are in this category you are advised to stay at home as much as possible and if you do go out take particular care to minimise contact with others outside your household there is another group of about 25 million people categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable these include people who have had organ transplants cancer patients and those with severe respiratory conditions this group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face to face contact   so called shielding now people in england and wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again while continuing to follow social distancing guidelines it means those with families will be able to go out once a day with members of their household people living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing despite the easing of lockdown restrictions across the uk scientists stress the need for people from different households to remain 2m 6ft apart social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets   packed with the virus   into the air these can be breathed in or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on and then touch your face with unwashed hands this coronavirus appears to thrive in crowded indoor spaces which is why pubs restaurants and many workplaces remain closed and the public has been advised against using public transport but virus transmission is less likely when fresh air is involved   usually when people are outside if you show symptoms of coronavirus   such as a dry cough high temperature or loss of taste   you must take extra precautions you should stay at home and not leave it for any reason this is known as self isolation you should not leave your property even to buy food or medicine and instead order these online or ask someone to drop them off at your home if the nhs test and trace team in england gets in touch because youve been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you will have to self isolate for up to 14 days   even if you feel fine the people you live with dont have to self isolate but they must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing there are similar tracing systems in scotland wales and northern ireland antibodies test a medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity the test detects antibodies in the blood which are produced by the body to fight off the disease asymptomatic someone who

short answer to this is no its true that you don\u2019t have to go into quarantine if you\u2019re returning to the uk from what\u2019s known as the common travel area cta   ireland isle of man and the channel islands when the government first announced its plans there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the cta and then on to the uk and so avoid having to self isolate however this loophole termed by some the dublin dodge has now been closed by the government travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the cta for 14 days or more you will have to show proof of when you entered the cta and how long you have spent there   such as a boarding pass or itinerary   when you enter the uk unless your flatmates were travelling with you they do not need to self isolate or quarantine with you however you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens bathrooms and sitting areas you should stay in a well ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened separate from your flatmates and if you can you should use a separate bathroom from them if you do need to share these facilities regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house both for bathing and showering and for washing your hands key workers are exempt from having to quarantine   as long as they are not displaying symptoms of coronavirus the government has published an extensive list of who is exempt from quarantine among others it includes people working in healthcare and seasonal agricultural workers the list details what you\u2019ll need to show when you return to the uk to prove your key worker status this differs between categories but typically it would include proof of your name and address the name of your employer and what work you\u2019ll be doing not necessarily if you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self isolate in quarantine you will not automatically qualify for statutory sick pay ssp so its possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave or else as unpaid leave the department of work and pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self isolate on their return it adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions meanwhile the foreign & commonwealth office is still advising uk nationals against taking all but essential international travel coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in china in december 2019 its more precise name is covid 19 there are actually hundreds of coronaviruses   most of which circulate among animals including pigs camels bats and cats but there are a few   such as covid 19   that infect humans some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses such as the common cold covid 19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia most infected people will have only mild symptoms   perhaps a fever aching limbs a cough and loss of taste or smell   and will recover without special treatment but some older people and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease diabetes or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell the nhs has more about symptoms when people recover from an infection their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again this immunity is not always long lasting or totally efficient however and can decrease over time it is unclear though if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again university of oxford\u2019s prof sarah gilbert who is working on creating a vaccine for covid 19 says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future the uk government views antibody tests   which can show if a person has had covid 19   as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work but the world health organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d   the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms   is five days on average however some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this the world health organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days but some researchers say it may be up to 24 days knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important it allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus both viruses are highly contagious on average its thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people while those with flu pass it on to about one other person there are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus if you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self isolate in quarantine you will not automatically qualify for statutory sick pay ssp so its possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home for four out of five people covid 19 will be a mild disease a bit like flu symptoms include fever a dry cough or loss of smell and tastehttps  wwwbbccouk news health 51048366 if the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia about one in seven people may need hospital treatment recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place some people will shrug off the illness quickly but for others the path to full health could take months and leave lasting problems this is the subject of ongoing research but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many silent spreaders there are   ranging from 5% to 80% of cases that was the conclusion of an analysis by prof carl heneghan of the university of oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects the upshot they said was that there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics and they said that if the screening for covid 19 is only carried out on people with symptoms   which has been the main focus of uk testing policy   then cases will be missed perhaps a lot of cases some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many silent carriers there may be diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home however some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors such as heart disease or obesity as well as diabetes   which put them at much higher risk of complications a third of virus deaths in england from 1 march to 11 may were linked to diabetes but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 insulin dependent or type 2 diabetes is still very low age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus say experts diabetes uk advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible as well as following social distancing measures dental practices in england have been told they can reopen on 8 june as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place these include limiting use of waiting areas screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers such as a plastic shield in reception areas currently if a patient is in considerable pain dentists can refer them to an urgent dental care udc hub these centres have been created across the uk to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements if a udc centre is not available in your area there may be other options some hospitals for example offer emergency dental walk in services but you should always speak to your local dentist first   or use the nhs 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one asthma uks advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler usually brown as prescribed this will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus including coronavirus carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up if your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus contact the online nhs 111 coronavirus service coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses or diabetes there is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy   and who dont for instance have respiratory problems   are at greater risk from coronavirus covid 19 can in a small number of cases lead to pneumonia most notably in people with pre existing lung conditions but as this is a new virus no one will have any immunity to it whether they have previously had pneumonia or any other form of coronavirus such as sars wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public it presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip reading to communicate but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus especially if in a hospital setting the charity action on hearing loss says there are some clinically approved see through covered face masks that help enable lip reading however they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic they say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate there are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help yes according to the advice from public health england a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine the important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures so wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off and don\u2019t touch your eyes nose or mouth at all wash the face coverings after each time you use them for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care such as wool or silk and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained there is no vaccine for this new virus as there is for flu which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects all personal protective equipment ppe worn during the highest risk situations   such as aprons gloves and surgical masks   should usually be disposed of after a single use or session however guidelines now say nhs staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so for example some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused the health and safety executive says it recognises some compromise is needed in these exceptional circumstances but doctors and nurses are not happy with this situation the royal college of nursing says its members can refuse to treat patients as a last resort if adequate ppe has not been provided if you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self isolating you should keep all contact to a minimum and if possible not be in the same room together the person self isolating should stay in a well ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keep away from other people in the house if you live with someone who has symptoms youll also need to self isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started   this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear if you get symptoms self isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start even if it means youre self isolating for longer than 14 days if you do not get symptoms you can stop self isolating after 14 days the current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely wherever possible however those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period should talk to their gp or clinician this is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed if you live with your partner they count as being part of your household if neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact having sex wont increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another if one person does have symptoms they should be self isolating in a separate room using contraception such as condoms wont alter your risk of catching the virus as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway if you are going to touch each others genitals its likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time   and we know the virus is passed through saliva dr alex george told the bbcs newsbeat essentially any possibility of transfer of coronavirus   from your mouth to your hands to genitals to someone elses nose or mouth   increases the risk of passing on coronavirus starting a new relationship is difficult during the current crisis but not impossible it is possible now to meet someone from another household alone or in the company of others outdoors    either in a public place or in a back garden on the other hand intimacy and privacy may be more of a problem people are still being advised to maintain a distance of 2m from anyone not in their household and it is still not permitted under lockdown regulations to meet someone from another household indoors either at your home or theirs and taking the relationship to a more intimate level is not permitted either the latest amendment to lockdown regulations states that \u201cno person may without reasonable excuse stay overnight at any place other than the place where they are living\u201d there are exemptions to this rule but none of them include romance it\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown because until recently there has been very little testing of the population as a whole it was mostly just those in hospital and some nhs and care staff who were being tested there is also a lag effect with the figures it takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases hospitalisations and then deaths   around three weeks at least   so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are it\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown but police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up what we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early april and the rate of infection has dropped significantly there\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised or dying from the virus where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the uk\u2019s care homes latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in england and wales   and nearly half of those in scotland and northern ireland   take place there following a drop in hospital patients with covid 19 the nhs has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in england urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted but gps will continue to use online consultations and regular testing will be offered to all staff the nhs says the pressure on many staff will remain unprecedented and employers must keep them safe routine elective surgery will be restarted with priority given to long waiters and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre covid 19 levels\u201d discussions are taking place in wales and northern ireland on how to resume normal nhs services scotlands health secretary has announced that nhs services will be gradually restarted without committing to any dates the simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know people who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the nhs in march and told not to go out for 12 weeks these are people with specific medical conditions the government is now advising these people   more than one million around the uk   to shield until the end of june vulnerable people in england and wales have been advised that from the beginning of june they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing shielding advice in northern ireland and scotland has not yet changed if you are concerned about whether a call text or email is genuine you can check the nhs england test and trace service website or the scottish government test and protect website or the public health agency website in northern ireland genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details they will also not ask you to set up a password or pin over the phone or to call a premium rate number such as those starting 09 or 087 if you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in england you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web based service instead pregnant women are being advised by the uk government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum however they should attend antenatal clinics as normal there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus but for a small number of women being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection the government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk if your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection these would be passed on through breastfeeding breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk   cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently while trying to avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands this is highly unlikely to happen according to scientists and vets while there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals it is possible that a pets fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal but even without the threat of coronavirus you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead and avoid touching your nose and mouth in general children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus according to data from china and other countries this may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold however children with underlying lung problems such as asthma may have to be more careful all schools in the uk are currently closed except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers primary schools in england are starting to reopen from 1 june depending on the number   pupils in reception and years 1 and 6 are among the first to return its expected that about half of the children entitled to return will do so at present it is not compulsory for parents to send their children to school and there will be no fines for non attendance however the government says that eligible children are strongly encouraged to attend it is expected that this temporary arrangement   where usual sanctions do not apply   will continue for all parents of any year groups going back in england during the summer term there are currently no plans for schools in wales scotland or northern ireland to reopen before the end of the summer term you can walk your dog as much as you like the government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want and can spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household there is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead but the royal parks for instance urge visitors to do this to help ensure people practise social distancing the government has said people in england can exercise outside as many times a day as they want they can also spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household the welsh and scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day you still cant use playgrounds outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces in england you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance as long as you follow social distancing while you are there however in scotland and wales people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside in northern ireland there are no restrictions on travel for those who are not self isolating yes it is government guidance on staying at home says where parents do not live in the same household children under 18 can be moved between their parents homes if neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self isolating children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them however the family division of the high court has said that in england and wales if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice they may vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe even if the other parent does not agree where this is the case family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone it depends on a number of factors typical business trips to germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out essential functions such as healthcare a certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case with the introduction of quarantine restrictions at uk borders from 8 june returning to the uk will not as straightforward anyone entering the uk from that point will need to self isolate for 14 days after arrival there are a number of exemptions to this rule including uk residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work legally no you are not being in a private car with someone from another household might not be classed as outdoors and meeting someone from another household \u201cindoors\u201d is against the law the law in england and northern ireland only allows more than two people from different households up to a maximum of six to meet outside in scotland eight people can meet outside but they can only be from two households in wales two households of any number of people can meet outside you also cannot get a taxi to bring your relative over to your home as cabs may only be taken for \u201cessential\u201d purposes driving tests were suspended in england scotland and wales for three months from 20 march so unless it was booked for a date after 20 june the test will not take place as planned a similar situation is in place in northern ireland a new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the driver and vehicles standards agency dvsa you cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself you can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker in scotland wales and northern ireland taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed as it is not counted as an essential journey the department for transport has indicated that this is also still the case in england despite the recent lockdown changes however the aa says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if for example a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping people affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed will be added to the mortgage balance this means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre payment meter so you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you you could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up the government says that if its urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account you should be able to top up online as well and you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you so you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this if your flight is cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline ryanair for example says customers who want a cash refund will receive it in due course as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual with fewer staff many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re booking instead if the airline later folds the voucher will probably become invalid and any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance if you\u2019re self employed you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32500 per month if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic and you meet certain conditions you must have been self employed since at least the start of april 2019 and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350000 a year on average initially this was a one off payment designed to cover march april and may up to a maximum total of \u00a37500 in august applications will open for a second and final payment covering 70% of profits up to a cap of \u00a32190 a month for another three months \u00a36570 in total the scheme   which is called the coronavirus self employment income support scheme   is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self employment the government has said that everyone should work from home if possible and only go into a workplace if their job absolutely cannot be done from home your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety if you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus you could argue that you have a right not to come into work if you still do not want to go in you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave but your employer does not have to agree to this an employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason self employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self isolate may apply for two benefits   universal credit or employment and support allowance normally you would be eligible after four days of being ill however the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay ssp from the first day off but charities are worried that there is still a five week delay before universal credit is paid if you are employed your employer has an obligation to pay your statutory sick pay ssp for up to 28 weeks normally you would be eligible after four days of being ill however the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay ssp from the first day off in the case of small and medium sized employers the government will fund sick pay for the first 14 days eligible employees are entitled to \u00a39585 a week anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the uk and are on a low income or out of work students in full time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit people aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child caring for a disabled person or cannot work you can use the governments benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to the government advises that people who are self isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal if they can\u2019t work from home employers must ensure any self isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer employees in self isolation are entitled to statutory sick pay for every day they are in isolation worth \u00a39585 per week as long as they qualify however employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish ultimately this is a personal decision but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now a recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally university campuses have been closed this term by the covid 19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn the university of cambridge has said it will have no face to face lectures in the next academic year and the university of manchester has said that to begin with its lectures will be taking place online only other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year before you make a firm choice the higher education watchdog office for students says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online on campus or a mixture and if the information isnt available next month it must be provided before clearing in august once you have all the information you need to weigh up whats important to you bear in mind the universities minister says youll have to pay full fees even if youre learning online   but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses also if your university can offer a campus experience access to facilities like libraries bars  and cafes is likely to be limited   so student life could be very different to normal the department for education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back in a statement it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d to claim a refund students first need to complain directly to their university if that is unsuccessful then students in england or wales can lodge an appeal with the office of the independent adjudicator oia if your university is in scotland then it\u2019s the spso scottish public services ombudsman and for northern ireland you go to the nipso northern ireland public services ombudsman  students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal most students have gone home to self isolate leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent if you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property first of all check your tenancy agreement some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice if you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d this could mean you pay less rent each month the ministry of justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits it says the measures are temporary and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point taking into account public health advice prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in march since then relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates or sending an email to the prison which is then printed out and passed on as a temporary measure secure phone handsets have been given to pre approved prisoners at 55 prisons allowing them to speak to a small number of pre authorised contacts video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions the earliest point at which places of worship could open is early july when the prime minister says some public places could reopen \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d however several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon ibrahim mogra a senior imam in leicester told the bbc that mosques present particular problems we are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship he said so we are talking about really large numbers of people the church of england says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year although the approach would vary on a regional basis the rt rev sarah mullally who\u2019s leading the church\u2019s plans for reopening says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books distancing within the church buildings and holy communion research conducted by the resolution foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600000 this year if you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the national careers service for advice on how to find job vacancies you can also search online for virtual job fairs this could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your cv and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job people experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test you can either do this via the nhs website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in england wales and northern ireland or 0800 028 2816 in scotland if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message email or phone the only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app that has not yet been launched in england outside the isle of wight when it is it will provide extra information for contact tracers but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online nothe department of health says the service will begin tracking those who tested positive in england on wednesday and going forward anyone who tested positive before that should already be self isolating for at least seven days with other members of their household self isolating for 14 days you will only be asked to report contacts known to you especially anyone in your household people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact less than 1m 3ft or have been within 2m 6ft of for more than 15 minutes the governments contact tracing app is not yet up and running when it becomes widely available it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage yes people who have previously tested positive will be asked to self isolate again thats because there are still a number of uncertainties about whether having coronavirus gives you immunity or whether people with immunity can transmit the illness to others health secretary matt hancock who tested positive for the virus in march told lbc radio that he would have to isolate if he was approached by a contact tracer no the tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive close contact means being less than 1m 3ft from somebody at any point or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes you shouldnt be that close to a delivery driver there is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry what questions do you have about coronavirus do you want to

        "text": "the government has come under pressure from mps and businesses to relax the 2m 6ft rule for social distancing to make it easier for people to return to work but scientists continue to question whether that would be safe given how little is known about how far coronavirus can spread the simple answer is that the closer you are to someone who is infected the greater the risk of catching the virus the world health organization says that a distance of 1m is safe some countries have adopted this guidance while others including the uk have gone further timing is also key the longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person the bigger the risk scientists advising the uk government say that spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m being exposed to someone coughing is riskier being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance in a study published in the medical journal the lancet scientists evaluated recent research into how the coronavirus can spread they conclude that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection the risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m but only 3% beyond that distance and the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m the risk is further reduced by half it can be traced back to research in the 1930s scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground most of those droplets they reckoned would land within 1 2m that is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto and then touching your face many scientists regard closeness and surface contacts as the main routes of transmission but some researchers are concerned that the coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols if that is the case then the flow of wind from someones breath could carry the virus over longer distances professor lydia bourouiba from the massachusetts institute of technology mit used high speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m and a study carried out at hospitals in china which found traces of coronavirus in covid 19 wards and intensive care units estimated that 4m was a better safe distance but for the us centers for disease control the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is currently uncertain and whats still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious there is wide agreement that the infection is more easily passed on indoors than outside in the fresh air japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of covid 19 following up the contacts of the people infected they estimated that the odds of the infection being passed on were nearly 19 times greater indoors than when outside in many countries including england and scotland people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible it is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it but there is a long way to go and confirming exactly the right distance is one of the unanswered questions it will take careful studies of how the virus can be carried and how viable it remains which will all take time"

        "text": "lockdown is starting to ease across the uk we can meet more people while in england some children are back in school and car showrooms and open air markets have reopened but some scientists even those advising government have been in mutinous mood   saying ministers are acting too soon and the lifting of restrictions has been described as a dangerous moment even by englands deputy chief medical officer things are far better than when lockdown came in there were an estimated 100000 new infections every day in england on 23 march the day when boris johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives that compares with around 8000 daily infections at the moment its somewhere in the range of 10 fold fewer but thats still considerable dr adam kurcharski from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine told the bbc the speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower the r number   the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto   was around three when lockdown came in that meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others now the r is around 07 09 meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others however a comparison by the university of oxford suggests the uk is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown and it is notable the governments own coronavirus alert system for england remains at level 4 rather than level 3 when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed the chief science adviser sir patrick vallance warns there is not a lot of room for manoeuvre and the data urges caution r is close to one   the tipping point where cases increase again and we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread the restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus but their precise impact is unknown uncertainty is a particular issue with schools the governments evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact there is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick throughout the pandemic the scientists and politicians have been following the same script but there is now a clear loud and public split between some of those advising government and those following the science more than a dozen sage committee members who advise government have spoken out saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down essentially were lifting the lid on a boiling pan and its just going to bubble over argued prof calum semple major deja vu feeling to mid march scientists incredibly concerned politicians ignoring this public doesnt want life disturbed end of twitter post  by @devisridhar there is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now   it may lock us into the current number of cases there are approximately 8000 infections a day if easing restrictions raises the r number close to one then we will continue to have around 8000 infections every day waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a second wave however that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer there is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the uk the aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected the strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus south korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39000 in the uk however there is a danger in expecting identical results the uk is not using gps tracking to ensure people do as they are told like south korea or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in hong kong speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the uk and an analysis of south koreas strategy by imperial college london suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections depending on how optimistic the number crunching the number of people that have been infected remains low so any immunity is also low that means there is the potential for a second wave but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react the plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens with a cautious piecemeal approach i think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high lets not call it a second wave lets call it a second bump said prof mark woolhouse from the university of edinburgh a sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely dr kucharski said i dont think well see a huge exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks it may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters it will be late summer or autumn or even winter depending on what happens it may be

        "text": "the government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 may its also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed   staff patients or those isolating at home the uk statistics authority chairman has written to the health secretary matt hancock saying the published official figures are far from complete and comprehensible the department of health and social care dhsc said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown and the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease but as the programme has expanded it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data people tested is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test on 22 may when the data for people was last published 140497 tests were carried out on 80297 people the gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result people with void or unclear results were sent a new test up to 19 may 8% of tests carried out at drive through and pop up testing sites were inconclusive the figure for home test kits was not provided there are also good clinical reasons to retest someone   to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms on top of this people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests but not the people tested figures the latest round of office for national statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 april 10 may involved 10705 participants together surveillance swab and antibody testing which are important but arent used to diagnose people individually accounted for almost 30000 of the just under 130000 tests carried out on 30 may all of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result the government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons so we cant tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people like health and care staff and care home residents are being tested regularly the dhsc was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted   as one person tested or many a spokesperson did refer to a small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test suggesting routine testing may be limited an imperial college london study by the same modelling group that has informed much of the governments response said in april that nhs staff should be tested weekly even if they didnt have symptoms this need for routine testing has been echoed by nhs providers the body representing hospital trusts and nadra ahmed chairwoman of the national care association which represents independent care providers said routine testing in care homes was just not happening on 28 april health secretary matt hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didnt have symptoms but ms ahmed described this as smoke and mirrors she said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents and were still waiting 14 days later some hadnt even been able to test their staff and residents once while others were struggling to get onto the portal the uk statistics authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out but not yet returned in the number of tests its chairman sir david norgrove accused the government of using the data to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding although the dhsc reached its target of providing 100000 tests a day by the end of april it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned after setting the 100000 tests a day target the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested in fact when it came to the people tested figures home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab this may account for some of the gap but again we cant say how much this in itself appeared to be a source of confusion   even within the department guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the people tested figure but this note was later taken off the website a dhsc spokesperson said these tests were only counted as people tested at the point of being analysed in the lab and that the note was removed to avoid confusion follow rachel on twitter"

        "text": "the uk is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months under the new rules we asked doctor and tv presenter xand van tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible details of the rules vary across the uk so if you are living outside of england some of the advice below may not apply to you the first thing to do is think about who youre inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them   we are very differently vulnerable to this virus if youre inviting overweight men who are older they face a very different risk to young families with young children if youre inviting people whove had the virus thats very different again think about the invitation and think about who youre putting at risk if youre thinking of inviting a 70 year old overweight man i would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept if youre shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings if you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly brilliant if they cant and people are walking through the house it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask wash their hands when they get into the house and then go straight into the garden they shouldnt touch anything you need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible to maintain social distancing about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six person gathering if everyone is from different households which is massive if you had 12 two metre by two metre picnic blankets you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that youre two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby i dont expect everyones got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that were talking about you need to find some way of measuring you could get a two metre pole a bamboo cane a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with hold it and spin around in a circle   everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other in your garden you could mark two metres out with blankets chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people   no one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench when we talk about gardens i look at mine and its a very small space to have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible in terms of bringing your own cutlery its difficult everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk theyre prepared to accept if you think youve had coronavirus and or youre low risk meaning youre young youre slim youre female   those are the main variables   your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other peoples cutlery but of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill if you are a man whos older and overweight and dont think youve had the virus i would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw if youre in the park you might not be able to wash your hands so i would say bring hand gel wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby if youre having people in your garden you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe you could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off if youre hosting say to everyone were all going to wash our hands once an hour you could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says wash your hands there needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet you should flush with the seat down   a lot of people dont bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids once you flush then you need to wipe down the loo you need either disinfectant wipes in the loo or you need a spray with some disposable towels you also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so youre not re contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom you want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom all the surfaces need to be wiped down even then remember its not a risk free zone probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated   you are definitely taking a risk by doing this youre not allowed to hug people and thats the rule but in my experience if a small child wants a hug its virtually impossible to stop them for people with nieces nephews grandchildren godchildren or other important children in their lives who they havent been able to see for a long time if youre going to a picnic in their garden its going to be quite difficult to avoid contact i would say if you do end up having a hug at least dont grab the person and pull them into your face a proper full frontal hug is the most dangerous but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous the only safe advice though is not to hug you should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering you are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population we still have a high level of transmission in the uk alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when theyre drunk the other thing is the time limit if you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking thats wildly different to coming over and saying were going to sit two metres apart for an hour and well wear a mask on the way in anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer the virus either moves through the air or it moves through droplets coming out of peoples mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets i would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left this virus is unpredictable and dangerous   significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the uk we have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it"

head teacher to find out its like doing a jigsaw puzzle where all the pieces are green that is how debbie whiting head teacher of north denes primary school in norfolk describes the task in front of her   remodelling her school during a pandemic so that three classes can return next month the more you look at things the more there is to think about she says classrooms have been stripped out new signage put up around the school and year groups divided into small bubbles to keep pupils away from each other and   it is hoped   minimise the risk of coronavirus spreading the school in great yarmouth already knows it will not be ready to reopen for reception year 1 and year 6 classes on 1 june and is instead working to a deadline of 8 june this summer the school should have been preparing to move into its new \u00a39m buildings but construction delays mean all focus is now on making the existing school safe for returning pupils the 1 june date might be convenient for being after half term but its not given us anything like the time we need to put things in place says mrs whiting its really difficult you just keep thinking have we caught everything parents have been asked whether they will send their children back   but only half have responded making planning difficult so far one third of those who have replied say their children will return mrs whiting estimates she can make her plans work if about 40% of the 180 children return if they all came back she would need an extra 12 classrooms at the school the school hopes to make social distancing as natural as possible for children by breaking classes into smaller bubbles of about seven pupils and two teachers but without knowing the intentions of the other families the plans could be useless mrs whiting has left the decision up to parents but wrote to them recently to warn them school will be a very different place until we have those numbers planning to keep everyone safe in bubbles is really tricky she said my concern is that theyve heard that schools are reopening and on 1 june they just arrive for the rest of term all school life will take place within the bubbles in those groups pupils will learn eat and play with each bubble using a nominated classroom and set of toilets to prevent cross infection children will not be allowed to take bags to school and will work in a new exercise book and their teacher will not take them home to mark uniform policy will be scrapped as children will need to wear clean clothes every day and many will have outgrown it anyway if theyve got different clothes on every day youll know that theyve actually changed said mrs whiting the school has gained experience from teaching the children of key workers over the past weeks and the numbers have steadily risen from eight pupils to 20 parents will expect us to social distance their children and we intend to do that says mrs whiting the school day will be re organised with staggered starts and a lunchtime finish once children have been given their food in the morning children in each bubble will arrive at 15 minute intervals and line up in the playground two metres 6ft 6ins apart before being led into their classrooms only one parent will be allowed to drop off and collect each child with no gathering by the school gates though mrs whiting acknowledges getting several children to school at different times is likely to cause problems in single parent households bubbles will be kept separate at break times and when they are given lunch with each being given their own area of the playground to use even before coronavirus the school was without its kitchen because of building works and could only use half of its main hall pupils movements around the school will be restricted mainly to their bubbles but the way they use the communal areas will change each year will have a separate entrance to the buildings and school corridors will operate a one way system so people can maintain their distance doors will be left propped open and handles cleaned regularly its about controlling all movement says mrs whiting we also started careful hand washing before the lockdown and the children have been pretty good at that hand dryers in the toilets have been switched off on official advice and replaced with paper towels while the school has ordered pedal bins for every classroom so that ppe   which will be used for first aid or personal care   can be disposed of safely and without contact classrooms will also look different with the need for distancing reducing capacity to about eight desks all rooms have now been decluttered and non essential items removed filling the schools storage spaces in the younger age groups classrooms soft furnishings rugs and toys have been removed   anything remaining will have to be washed at the end of each day cleaning routines have been stepped up and surfaces will be disinfected regularly pupils will be asked to bring their own stationery and forbidden from sharing in a letter to parents mrs whiting had previously warned there is no such thing as social distancing in a school   we can try but we certainly cannot guarantee it the logistics of preparing the school come on top of the everyday challenges of leading a school in one of the most deprived boroughs in the country the government line is to get children in school so that they dont fall behind and in disadvantaged areas that is important says mrs whiting but a lot of those who want to return are not those who are in that group the department for education says it wants children back in schools for their education and wellbeing and the phased return is based on scientific and medical advice for head teachers the last few weeks have been wearing says mrs whiting as they juggle pressures from government parents who want their children to be kept at home and those who want them back at school underpinning all the preparations her focus has been on keeping the children as safe as possible this is something ive never ever had to deal with she said and you do wonder what happens if someone gets it and heaven forbid theres a fatality but i cant hold myself responsible for that because im not the one who is asking them to come back the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites"

        "text": "some children in england will be going back to school from monday 1 june following a heated debate the government published the advice it received from scientists on what is known about the impact of more children returning to the classroom children are at extremely low risk of becoming ill from the virus adults   and particularly older adults   are far more likely to be seriously ill and die from complications of the virus across the uk 001% of deaths were people under 15 1% were aged 15 44 and about 75% were over 75 half of all the people with confirmed coronavirus who were admitted to critical care units in england wales and northern ireland were 60 as at 15 may and half were younger according to a research charity but the majority were over 50 and fewer than 10% were younger than 40 children have so far only accounted for between 1% and 5% of all diagnosed cases according to prof adilia warris a paediatric infectious diseases specialist at the university of exeter they often have milder disease than adults she says pointing out that deaths have been rare there have been some extremely rare cases of children developing an inflammatory syndrome similar to kawasaki disease and scientists are exploring a possible delayed immune response to coronavirus this is one of the missing pieces of the puzzle about coronavirus and how it spreads it is still not clear how infectious anyone with very mild symptoms or no symptoms at all is   at any age to understand this we would need widespread antibody testing to identify who has had the virus across the whole population and work out how they might have caught it a university college london review of the evidence based on studies using contact tracing and population screening suggested children were half as likely as adults to catch the virus the governments scientific advisory group for emergencies sage said the balance of evidence suggested children might be both less likely to catch it and if they do catch it less likely to pass it on but the evidence remains inconclusive it said one study looking at cases in shenzhen in china at the beginning of the year suggested that children were just as likely to catch the virus raising the fear that they could be transmitting it without showing any symptoms but research carried out since then has been more reassuring studies of clusters of infections in family groups across china have concluded   based on contact tracing   that none of the infections were likely to have been introduced by children a study of a cluster of infections in the french alps found that a child who tested positive for the virus did not pass it on to any of the more than 100 people they had contact with during the time they had symptoms community studies in iceland south korea the netherlands and  italy all found evidence children were less likely to have   or have had   the virus than adults the italian region studied tested 70% of its population a review of the evidence by a global team of researchers concluded the role of children in transmission is unclear but consistent evidence is demonstrating a lower likelihood of acquiring infection and lower rates of children bringing infections into households one theory for why children generally have no symptoms or milder ones is that their lungs might contain fewer of the receptors that coronavirus uses to infect cells but experts say there is not yet any good evidence to support this more children in schools means more teachers working and more parents at the school gates and its not yet clear how those extra contacts might affect the spread of infection as the sage report says it is important to understand the other types of social distancing measures that staff parents and students are engaging in beyond the boundaries of the school the group of scientists modelled nine different return to school scenarios on 16 may deputy chief medical officer for england dr jenny harries said the government had opted for the one estimated to give the smallest increase in the r number   the measure of how fast the disease is spreading   while still bringing significant numbers of children back to school it was reported that in 22 european union countries where schools were partially reopened there hadnt been a significant increase in cases including among staff these countries all opened up schools to different extents france did report a small uptick in cases after partially re opening schools but world health organization who chief scientist dr soumya swaminathan agrees that children are less capable of spreading the virus and are at very low risk of getting ill from the disease what we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools government guidelines say it wants to start with reception year 1 and year 6 children in england because the government says secondary schools in england will be able to reopen to year 10 and year 12 from monday 15 june but only a quarter of pupils from those years will be allowed in school at any one time the schools minister nick gibbs told mps there is still no decision about the governments ambition to send all primary children in england back before the summer break"

so we hit 25000 tests a day   prime minister boris johnson 18 march outcome on the same day a press release from the department of health and social care dhsc gave more details of the tests to diagnose coronavirus and said the increased capacity is expected to be ready within four weeks but the government did not hit 25000 tests a day by mid april only 18665 tests were conducted in the uk excluding northern ireland on 15 april in terms of testing capacity   the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day   that stood at more than 30000 by mid april i am now setting the goal of 100000 tests per day by the end of this month   health secretary matt hancock 2 april outcome on 1 may the government said it had reached the target and announced 122347 tests for the last day of the month 30 april the testing figure had been averaging about 20000 a day but increased significantly in the last days of april when home testing kits were introduced in large numbers towards the end of the month dhsc began counting those sent out as part of its daily test figures so it doesnt mean the test was actually used by someone on that day previously only instances in which the testing swab had been processed through a lab were counted as a test the 122347 figure included about 40000 kits sent out to homes and test centres in a letter to mr hancock on 2 june sir david norgrove chair of statistical watchdog the uk statistics authority was critical of this methodology the aim seems to be to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding he wrote prof john newton who leads the governments testing programme said on 1 may thats the way they are counted have always been counted and the way we were advised to count them by officials in may using that methodology the government hit its target 18 times and missed it 13 times the devolved administrations in wales and scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing but waless health minister vaughan gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5000 tests a day by mid april blaming problems obtaining testing kits likewise first minister nicola sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 april that scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10000 tests per day by the end of april saying we are working towards a capacity of 3500 by the end of april the scottish government announced at the beginning of may that it had reached this reduced target the ambition clearly is to get up to 200000 a day by the end of this month and then to go even higher   boris johnson in parliament 6 may there had been some confusion as to whether the target for testing by the end of may was 200000 tests conducted or a capacity to do this many tests matt hancock eventually clarified that it would be the capacity for tests and that it would include antibody tests which establish whether somebody previously had the virus and tests being sent out to a random cross section of society by statisticians as well as those conducted on people actually displaying symptoms on 30 may the dhsc announced that the uk had hit the target with labs able to process 205634 tests a day this included capacity to do 40000 antibody tests a day on 31 may they carried out 23000 antibody tests when it comes to number of people actually tested for coronavirus on a daily basis the government has not released this figure since 22 may the dhsc says the number has been temporarily paused we are working with boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of april   matt hancock statement 4 april outcome dhsc told the bbc on 4 may that 49 regional test centres were operational across the country mr hancock had previously said in a statement that there would be over 50 by the end of april the drive through test centres are run by boots and other commercial providers dhsc also said that 96 mobile testing sites were in service by 4 may by mid may well have an initial 18000 contact tracers in place   matt hancock 1 may outcome on 1 may mr hancock said that the governments testing programme was the first element in the wider strategy to test track and trace he added that an initial 18000 contact tracing staff would be in place by mid may their role is to identify individuals that have covid 19 and then to track and trace anyone theyve recently been in contact with those individuals can then get themselves tested on 18 may mr hancock told parliament that 21000 contact tracers had been recruited in england of whom 7500 were healthcare professionals and on 20 may mr johnson told parliament already we have recruited 24000 trackers   by 1 june we will have 25000 i have great confidence that by 1 june we will have a system that will help us very greatly to defeat this disease on 1 june matt hancock said that the contact tracers had been working since thursday 28 may but would not give figures for how many people they had contacted on the personal protective equipment the answer is by the end of this week   boris johnson 25 march outcome on 25 march mr johnson was asked in parliament when every single person working in care homes around the country would receive the personal protective equipment ppe they needed he said it would happen by the end of that week however that didnt appear to happen in early april nadra ahmed from the national care association said the issue we hear most is i am desperate for masks has anyone got any gloves i am down to my last stock once you run out it is a question of being down to marigolds and bin liners according to those working in the care home sector the situation improved later in april but was not resolved martin green from care england said on 20 april that access to ppe remains problematic and that care homes still need a consistent supply the dhsc says that from 25 february to 27 may over 151 billion items of ppe have been delivered across the health and social care system in england it hasnt given a figure for care homes this includes it has been counting gloves individually so this last figure would be over 451m if counted as pairs concerns about the availability of ppe in care homes have also been raised in scotland and wales making sure that the nhs always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical   matt hancock 17 april outcome the government has met its objective by 18 may the last day the figures were published the proportion of critical care beds occupied by covid 19 patients had fallen to 20% in england 17% in wales 10% in scotland and 15% in northern ireland the spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for the virus the government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment our goal instead of the 30000 is that we need 18000 ventilators over the coming two weeks   matt hancock 5 april outcome the dhsc told the bbc that by 5 may the government had managed to make 10900 mechanical ventilators available to the nhs across the uk mr hancocks 18000 target was for this type of ventilator according to the dhsc the original uk target had been higher but was reduced mr hancock said because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus a spokesperson for the dhsc said every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one we continue to keep capacity ahead of demand this article was updated to reflect the latest figures on testing and contact tracers what claims do you want bbc reality check

put on leave due to the coronavirus outbreak and to prevent employers having to make mass redundancies so how does it work and who is eligible the government is currently paying the wages of more than a quarter of uk jobs through its furlough programme   the coronavirus job retention scheme it puts workers on leave and allows them to stay on the payroll about 84 million workers have been furloughed since march with the government paying 80% of their salaries up to \u00a32500 a month companies can top up this pay if they choose and must let employees know they have been furloughed the scheme

firms to decide what part time means and pay the wages for that time they will be able to set the hours and shift patterns staff will work for example mr sunak said an employer could bring someone back to work two days a week in that situation the employer would pay for those days while the furlough scheme would cover the employee for the other three working days from 1 august employers will

employee such as a nanny if they are paid through paye the self employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit if they meet certain conditions they must have been self employed since at least the start of april 2019 and earn an average of less than \u00a350000 in a tax year  those who receive it can continue to work the grant is a one off payment covering three months up to a maximum of \u00a37500 anyone placed on furlough has the same employment rights as before if you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough if you are on unpaid leave shielding for health reasons or have caring responsibilities you are also eligible staff on maternity paternity adoption or shared parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage if you are placed on furlough you cant do any work for your employer this will change from july onwards when the government says furloughed workers can return on a part time basis you can volunteer in the community or even for your company as long as you arent creating revenue or providing a service employers can give employees additional training but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage from july to october you may be able to work part time and be furloughed for the remainder of your hours if you work for more than one firm you can receive furlough from any of them up to \u00a32500 a month per employer you can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer provided you are not breaching any existing contracts companies dont have to keep on any employees when furlough ends and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages the hope is that by the time the scheme ends restrictions will have lifted and businesses can start paying full salaries again"

their staff working from home permanently employees are coming to realise remote working is not only possible but in some cases preferable a shift to a new way of working might already be under way such a shift could have profound implications on our home life and by extension on the life of our towns and cities almost a quarter of all office space in england and wales is in central london alone to understand those implications we brought together four experts on city life all of whom were working from home paul cheshire professor of economic geography london school of economics i do think well go back to offices but not in the same way people are more productive when they are closer together with face to face contact theres 20 years of really good persuasive research demonstrating how important that is there are lots of things you cannot do except with other people   people are innately social animals les back professor of sociology goldsmiths i do think we are at a tipping point theres a reorientation a recalibration of the relationship between place and time and social life that were on the cusp of we may see profound changes some things may not come back aude bicquelet lock deputy head of policy and research royal town planning institute its true some companies have said that they could allow their workforce to work from home forever twitter said it facebook said it the ceo of barclays said that putting 7000 people in the office might be a thing of the past the experience of going to the office in aberystwyth isnt the same as going to the office in london the decline of office space will affect small medium and large cities in different ways les back the hollowing out of city life has been coming for a long time it may be that what will happen is that some businesses wont come back to the centre of the city and think its too risky   or there may be other economic drivers where people will just take the opportunity to ask why are we investing so much of our capital in these large office spaces i think there are possibly huge effects of more working from home theres the pressure on the domestic sphere theres the pressure on gendered relationships at home on the blurring and overlaying of parenting and work and the pressures that would cause aude bicquelet lock i think what we will see is that local centres may see more diversification   more dining more social activities as people may want to meet each other also working from home may mean getting access to workplaces in local towns for some days growth is to be expected in these areas the contrary could apply to bigger cities which of course raises the question of how the office space could be reused there are several options like turning offices into residential spaces which hasnt always been done with absolute success i also wonder whether we will need conference halls and other meeting spaces as we did in the past paul cheshire you will get more people working from home which will mean there will be more demand for large houses you have to have a workspace which will push you out you may need to move to commute maybe once a week twice a week to your headquarters wherever that is for meetings therefore youll accept a longer commute for cheaper space youll tend to move further away from the city centre on the other hand there will be people who have to stay in the offices stay in the concentration the social interaction who will become even more strongly attracted to the city centre but you will probably also get localised desk sharing specialised areas where people can go if youre a homeworker where you can occasionally get better it or better facilities or get away from your children there will be an opening up in smaller towns of hot desking spaces we will need more space what you would be doing is opening land close to stations with good access to city centres you could build a million houses on green belt land within 45 minutes of central london because theres so much green belt land the fastest growing places for people commuting to london are incredibly far away   peterborough york somerset people are living miles out in order to get affordable land and more space that will be accelerated and it will be particularly accelerated unless we are willing to release land close to transport nodes that will give access to jobs margaret bell professor of transport and the environment university of newcastle our research has shown that in a study of commuting to newcastle the 7% of trips over 50km were responsible for 60% of the carbon emissions the further you travel the more detrimental effect with emissions paul cheshire thats one of the ironies of the green belt forcing people to commute further margaret bell my worry is people buying more cars and those who have cars will use them more what we do need is incentives to use bicycles more and to get people to shift towards living closer to their work or workplaces or arranging for people to go to work more locally we need a bottom up approach to understand peoples needs and try and tailor the transport accordingly paul cheshire housing particularly in england is very energy inefficient theres quite a big carbon footprint with more time spent in the home because home heating and home insulation is far far worse than modern commercial premises are margaret bell some work we did in leicester showed that if you work from home on average you use 75% more energy than you save by not going into work and that corresponds to a 75% increase in carbon dioxide   purely and simply because if you need heating and gas electricity at home thats more than what you save by not going into work by car and so coupled with the isolation effect its sensible for local businesses to open up their hot desking offices or even have reciprocal arrangements with companies where consultants working more out of town could reciprocate hot desking in offices les back we are predominantly talking about people who work in finance service sectors white collar jobs and white collar workers that isnt the workforce of cities what about hospital school and other public sector jobs also cities are important because theyre places of encounter places of difference that difference and the negotiations that happen across racial and cultural difference take on particular qualities in the centre of cities that are not the same in the outskirts and in the suburbs aude bicquelet lock everyone will have gone through the lockdown and will have gone through the changes and had new habits and will have strong views about what it is they want what works for them and what doesnt and i think one of the first things we will have to do as urban planners and policymakers is listen to what they want but there will be financial constraints paul cheshire the other issue is peoples fear how long will it take people to recover from the experience of being worried about being in crowds being vulnerable i think people will recover from that if there is a vaccine if the virus subsides if that happens offices will reassert themselves and all those things we liked doing in city centres will also reassert themselves that may take quite a long time office life for many has changed significantly some will choose to continue working from home while for others shielding they

        "text": "one of the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic has been the massive reduction in air travel in recent months with daily flights down some 80% since the start of the year some airlines have grounded their entire fleets while others have been focusing on cargo flights in an effort to help keep supply chains functioning and make what money they can now however many carriers are making plans to get back in the air ryanair for example says it plans to reintroduce 40% of its schedule from july easyjet is starting a limited service this month and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of august while air france klm and lufthansa will begin flying very limited schedules by the end of june hungarian carrier wizz air has already resumed flights in the uk the situation is complicated by the introduction of controversial quarantine rules on 8 june   which will force passengers to isolate themselves for two weeks after arriving in the country but can passengers fly safely or will they be at risk of infection the covid 19 coronavirus is still relatively new so accurate data on how it can spread between aircraft passengers is in short supply but previous studies have looked at the spread of other respiratory illnesses based on the available information us centers for disease control and prevention generally tries to track down people sitting in the two rows in front and the two rows behind passengers found to have serious infections a 2018 study by researchers from emory university in atlanta attempted to model how passengers and crew moved about an aircraft and how that might affect the transmission of infectious diseases a droplet mediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond one metre from the infectious passenger thus transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger the researchers concluded but contrary to this earlier research   led by the same academics   had shown that in real life cases passengers with sars or influenza actually appeared to have infected a number of people well outside their immediate area their explanation was that some of those who became ill had become infected in the airport while embarking or disembarking from the plane or from touching contaminated surfaces rather than by breathing in infected droplets the simulations also indicated that because cabin crew moved around the aircraft and had numerous contacts with different passengers they could generate several new infections and concluded it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill meanwhile public health officials in canada say they did not find any cases of further infection after two passengers on a flight from guangzhou to toronto were found to have covid 19 the flight had 350 people on board and lasted for 15 hours although many people might think that sitting in a confined space for long periods would inevitably spread infections the chief engineer at aerospace giant airbus insists that is not the case jean brice dumont argues that the way modern aircraft are designed means that the air is intrinsically very clean every two to three minutes mathematically all the air is renewed he says that means 20 to 30 times per hour the air around you is completely renewed put simply air is collected from outside the aircraft normally through the engine and mixed with recycled air from the cabin the recycled air which is reused in part to keep temperature and humidity at the correct levels is passed through hepa high efficiency particulate air filters that are similar to those used in hospitals the covid 19 virus is about 125 nanometres in diameter a nanometre is a billionth of a metre and is within the particle size range that hepa filters capture   10 nanometres and above mr dumont says hepa filters have standards and the standards we use in commercial aviation are among the highest standards they filter out 9997% of particulates small particles of the size of covid 19 the flow of the air itself he explains is also designed to minimise infection risks the air flows vertically it is blown from above your head and evacuated from beneath your feet that makes the level of propagation of anything in the air quite limited so a passenger from row one for example cannot contaminate someone in row 20 but is this enough this regular flow of air from top to bottom can be disrupted by passengers leaving their seats or cabin crew moving up and down the aisles thus altering the path of any airborne particles and crucially while hepa filters do work they cant capture all covid 19 droplets or aerosols before you might breathe them in says dr julian tang consultant virologist at the leicester royal infirmary and associate professor at leicester university he is also one of the team behind a study published this month looking at minimising the airborne transmission of covid 19 in enclosed spaces filtration only works on mass airflows most of the transmission during a plane journey will be those short range face to face conversations close range aerosol transmission is what you have to be worried about on a plane train or a bus   this is the biggest risk and even if you are further away the risk is not eliminated says dr tang how long covid 19 can remain airborne depends on a range of factors it varies between different people it varies depending on the state of your infection and you cant say all the droplets will fall to the ground within two metres some smaller droplets can stay suspended and travel up to 16 metres   and they all could be carrying the virus dr tang and his fellow authors say there is accumulating evidence for the important role of airborne transmission when it comes to infectious diseases such as covid 19 or mers sars and influenza something which they argue has been overlooked but mr dumont believes that simple precautions such as wearing masks and coughing or sneezing into an elbow will minimise risks i want to be precise on that we want people to wear masks he says this he claims combined with the rapid replacement of air should minimise exposure so would it also be a rational move to enforce social distancing on aircraft for example by blocking out middle seats   a move contemplated by some airlines but described by ryanairs ceo michael oleary as idiotic we dont think so says mr dumont it doesnt add to the risk reduction we believe virologist dr tang disagrees the problem is that if youre sitting next to somebody   06 metres in economy say   whos coughing and sneezing in that immediate area that aerosol will reach you before it has time to reach the filtration system get filtered and come back down again meanwhile the international air transport association iata which represents airlines has set out a detailed biosecurity roadmap which it is presenting as a blueprint to governments for reopening the industry much of what it has to say focuses not on the flight itself but on the time spent in the airport   where large numbers of people could normally be expected to come into contact with one another it wants that time to be minimised as much as possible as a result it is calling for the actual flight is considered to be relatively low risk   and according to iata vice president nick careem physical distancing on board is not necessary the emphasis he says should be on enhanced and frequent deep cleaning of the cabin as well as measures to avoid passengers congregating in specific areas that could include banning queues for the washrooms the key message mr careem says is that there is no silver bullet no single measure that can prevent infection dr tang meanwhile says he would fly with precautions if i get on a plane ill be wearing a mask its not 100% but at least ill have some protection"

career making photography the work was born when i met yana a very special young woman who has embraced her uniqueness and is proud of who she is i thought of a cat that would amplify yanas special beauty sourced it and photographed them together todays visual culture can be quite superficial and people sometimes are overly demanding towards themselves and others so i wanted to show that any physical appearance should be accepted and a person should be appreciated for who they are as a visual artist i see my responsibility in showing what is really important truthful and valuable and i feel like this work has achieved that dave my husband and i moved to manchester in 2014 and wed been trying to establish ourselves as photographers with local businesses and organisations we had over an hour with bill turnbull after his last show to photograph him against a backdrop and then behind the scenes around the bbc breakfast set i love the combination of happiness and thoughtfulness perhaps showing the range of emotions he was experiencing that day it was a real joy to be part of this commission and to see it later in print in the radio times was amazing in terms of helping our small photographic business to be a little more visible to commissioners this was one of those shoots which i feel really helped us on our way this photograph of the cake judge was shot at the hampshire and new forest county show in 2004 she was a lovely lady who had been drafted in last minute to judge all the entries in the cake competitions clearly she had thrown herself in to the role and this is a lovely example of the kind of gentle humour i was beginning to develop in my practice which is influenced by my love of jacques tati humour is the cornerstone upon which i have built my practice this image is from my lingering ghosts series the work began at a refugee drop in centre in cardiff in 2013 and later expanded across the uk after a month of volunteering and speaking with people at the drop in i found many applying for refugee status were deeply affected by an inefficient immigration system the portraits in the series are scratched to show the loss of identity and frustration people feel whilst keeping them anonymous for their own safety this portrait has received significant awards and features but the breakthrough moment was the green lady on the cover of british journal of photographys migration issue in 2016 in 2018 i began working on xo a project about expatriates living in oman and their relationship to local omanis driven by the desire to challenge my own perspective which had been influenced by western media i wanted to create a positive news story counterpoint to some western misconceptions of the middle east this particular image from the series was made at the british embassy in oman with some of the expatriate maintenance workers it was a huge privilege to be invited there considering i was still a student at the time and i remember reflecting that it felt like everything was coming together when i took this image id been a photographer for six years mainly shooting actor headshots the portraits that help them get auditions i was beginning to explore my creative side by shooting personal work and seeking out advertising work for theatre and film companies but to be honest i saw myself as mainly a solid technician i didnt have a lot of artistic confidence then one day a commission came in from english touring theatre to shoot a poster image for their revival of conor mcphersons haunting play the weir come the shoot day i was nervous but confident because of our preparation and everything went better than i could have hoped i loved the shoot the client was delighted with the finished images and i got to see the poster up all around the country when the show went out on tour even better nine months later i put the full set of images into the british institute of professional photographys annual awards and won not just a gold in the portrait category but also the photographer of the year 2018 award as well i had the privilege of being trusted enough to form a historically unique collaboration between an artist and a military commander in accomplishing a conceptual body of work investigating one of the worlds longest unresolved disputes   a career defining moment not for a commercial or financial milestone but the moment when trust and authenticity circumvented everything else in the process of making images that jointly challenged political entrenchment documentary norms of conflict photography as well as the perception of a photographs acceptance as authentic and true the project that resulted from this collaboration was toy soldiers the war games of non resolution in western sahara the bbc interviewed simon thorpe about this series at the time this was taken in 1999 for irish rock band aslan and features singer christy dignams hands and feet i was just starting out in my career as a photographer when i was approached by aslans management to photograph a series of images of the band members that would be used as on stage artwork for a live concert the band were recording in dublin the subsequent concert was released as a live album made in dublin and this image was chosen for the cover"

to repeatedly perform oral sex on her when they were alone at the age of six an attempt by ms ebe to stop the abuse by threatening to report the nanny to her parents almost cost her her life she the nanny poured a bucket full of hot water on me that left me in excruciating pain i had to be taken to the hospital and i missed a year of school ms ebe told the bbc ms ebe said the nanny told her parents it was an accident and so fearing for her safety she did not say anything more at the time the second time ms ebe was sexually abused she was a 21 year old student in her second year at university who was recovering from a recent surgery she recalls being raped by a doctor who made an excuse to take her to his house for an appointment instead of a medical centre he tore off my clothes and raped me she said i was weak from the surgery and could do little to resist him i did not go to the police or anyone for that matter i did not even know that rape cases were to be reported to the police in nigeria it is not uncommon for rape to go unreported some victims and their families fearing stigmatisation police extortion and a lack of trust in the judicial process choose not to report cases to the authorities there have also been instances where those brave enough to report are targeted with derogatory comments at the police station  2279reported cases of rape and indecent assault 1164reported cases of unnatural offences ie anal sex 0convictions reported by police 1state out of 36 reported no cases of indecent assault they are either vilified for their dressing being at the wrong place at the wrong time or accused of making up claims of rape said ms ebe who is now a social worker and runs a charity helping street children people with disabilities and survivors of sexual abuse she often talks about her experiences in order to help other rape survivors she says victims often find brick walls at the hospitals police stations and courts where they are supposed to get justice the penalty for rape in nigeria is up to 14 years in prison but i have seen a judge sentence someone to just four years with two years suspended because he was young and had a life in front of him she said what about the victim whose life he adversely affected in 2019 in the capital abuja some women who were arrested during a police raid accused officers of raping them they said the police accused them of being sex workers and while they were at the police station they were repeatedly raped by officers the police denied the accusations and the matter is currently in court such incidents dont reassure victims that the police station is where they can get help their representative dorothy njemanze told the bbc no one knows exactly how many rapes take place in the west african state annually the official nigeria bureau of statistics said more than 2200 cases of rape and indecent assault were reported in 2017 but experts say the true number of rapes is likely to be much higher we get at least six people coming in for cases of domestic violence per week ms njemanze said during the coronavirus lockdown we started receiving four to seven cases per day and 70% of them were related to rape the results of a survey published by noipolls in july 2019 suggested that up to one in every three girls living in nigeria could have experienced at least one form of sexual assault by the time they reach 25 recent laws have broadened the scope under which sexual offences can be penalised in nigeria making it easier to try suspects before now the part of the nigerian constitution that deals with rape was in the criminal code and meant that cases had to be tried within two months or they would be statute barred ineligible to be heard in a court but that is no longer the case stephanie ekpebulu from a coalition of lawyers that does pro bono work with rape victims told the bbc however many states across nigeria have not implemented the new laws most states in northern nigeria practise the sharia system of justice that would run at variance with the violence against persons prohibition act one of the new laws lawyer okani emmanuel said in the north its the religion in the south it is down to the cultural impediments where they have some widowhood practices that run contrary to the law he said the shortcomings in nigerias legal system where any case is likely to take years to prosecute and a police force accused of not being thorough in its investigations also discourages victims from approaching the courts for justice ms njemanze advises anyone who has been raped to try and preserve evidence like clothing that can be used in court most times hospitals want to see a police report before treating and thats very unfair because its a time bound crime she said the first thing is to preserve all the evidence that we can get and treat for sexually transmitted infections you may also be interested in prosecutorial agencies like the police have also been accused of hampering the chances of victims getting a fair hearing in court most times the police take the victims to private hospitals where there are bills to be paid and expect traumatised victims to foot them in extreme cases the suspects are asked to foot the bills asked mr emmanuel how can such a system guarantee justice following the outburst of national outrage police announced they had made an arrest in the case of uwa whose body was found in a church they said a fire extinguisher used in her murder was examined by forensic experts and fingerprints of the suspect identified nigerias police chief also announced special investigators would be deployed to gender desks at police stations across the country to respond to increasing challenges of sexual assaults and gender based violence however uwas case has not been without its own controversy her family accused the police of making snide comments and demanding bribes before investigating the case they asked my father if he was the first person whose daughter would be raped the victims sister told journalists this is the video of uwa\u2019s sister talking about the police and their reaction to her sister\u2019s death pictwittercom lo5dgqgakj end of twitter post  by @badmansophss police have not responded to the allegations some of the recent campaigning has also been against a culture of victim blaming in nigerian society stop the rapestop victim shaming and blamingwe are tired of being afraid in our own skin #wearetired #justiceforuwa #saynotorape pictwittercom qdglq3qd48 end of twitter post  by @edofirstlady while another suggested that wearing a hijab was no protection dress properlythank god islam gave us hijabdont be stupidi had my hijab on all through when i was raped end of twitter post  by @hauwa_ojeifo the online anger has also been directed at official systems campaigners say focuses too much on educating girls about sex but ignores the boys who become men its time to teach the boys what consent is and that no is no ms ekpebulu told the bbc if you have been affected by sexual abuse or violence in nigeria help and support is available at naptip if you are in the uk you can find advice at bbc action line"

        "text": "theres a big black sky over my town that line from dancing on my own is robyns love letter to the weather in her home city of stockholm sweden its one of her two favourite lyrics from the track which has just turned ten years old it also happens to be my favourite song of all time that means ive spent a decade of dancing and singing to it at clubs festivals and in friends kitchens its soundtracked some of the most personal moments in my life under recent lockdown its been viewed in another new light with an accompanying tiktok challenge from robyn herself like many other people i love the bittersweet combination of hearing something so uplifting yet so heartbreaking there are so many highlights but robyn tells me her other favourite line is i just wanna dance all night at that point in the song shes already taken us to the club where were watching her ex kiss a new partner weve all been there right she says it represents the precise moment on the dancefloor when you have to get your desperation frustration and sadness out its been described as the ultimate sad banger end of youtube post  by robynvevo with its multiple cover versions and the number of films and tv shows its popped up in the song is considered a classic with outlets like rolling stone nme and stereogum all ranking it as the best song of the last decade by 2010 robyn had transformed from mid 1990s major label pop star into a fiercely independent artist with her own record label konichiwa records with every heartbeat had also given her a uk number one single in 2007 dancing on my own was her first new music in years and the lead single from the first of her three body talk albums which she released over six months i knew i wanted to make a song called dancing on my own robyn tells radio 1 newsbeat from her apartment in stockholm i just didnt know what it was going to be about with an idea of a chorus in her mind robyn started working with swedish producer patrik berger who shed collaborated with on her previous album at the beginning patrik remembers the song having an acoustic vibe the chorus came first and everything else fell into place and it felt like it was writing itself patrik admits they were super picky about every aspect of the song and he recently found a notebook with hundreds of lyrics that were written and scrapped along the way every single word needed to feel right he tells newsbeat his favourite lyric is i know where youre at i bet shes around which he feels represents the self destructive part of you when we know we shouldnt go there its like scratching a wound robyn also remembers patrik spending a lot of time on the individual components of the song the drums the bass and the pounding staccato it starts with we kept building and it kept getting better and better and better she says it was an exciting session i remember sending the demo to the record label and telling them i thought we had a good single robyn says shes proud of dancing on my own because it features elements of many different worlds she loves including prince songs 80s rock ballads and queer electronica the song was a hit dancing on my own made number eight in the uk singles chart it went on to top year end critics polls robyn performed it on tv shows around the world and it was nominated for a grammy then came the first of robyns two defining moments in the life of her song well get to the second later in 2012 it was used in the first season of hbos girls the tv comedy drama created by lena dunham robyn says the use of the song was genius while lena dunham tells newsbeat it was magical in the episode lenas character hannah finds out her ex boyfriend is gay shes sat in her flat and dancing on my own starts up on her laptop her best friend marnie alison williams comes home and they dance in hannahs bedroom to the track which then plays over the end credits that moment on set was meant to be so brief and so light says lena but it took on so much importance because it marked the first time myself and alison felt comfortable in our characters off camera she says the whole crew was dancing and people were crying you could feel the power and love that went into the song when lena accepted her golden globe for best actress in 2013 dancing on my own was playing as she walked to the stage collect it it was like having a companion in that very public moment dancing on my own has also been featured in gossip girl orange is the new black rupauls drag race movies teen spirit and long shot and the masked singer usa its also been covered multiple times by artists including kings of leon and kelly clarkson i really like kellys version says robyn she has a really powerful voice she recorded one of my favourite max martin songs since u been gone which i covered in the radio 1 live lounge so thats funny but its most famous cover is by calum scott who gave the song a second lease of life in 2015 the british singer auditioned for britains got talent with a stripped back version of the track the video of which has now been viewed  288 million times i fell in love with the song instantly he says i was about 21 when it was originally released and it came at the height of me figuring out my personality he points to the lyric im right over here why cant you see me as the precise moment he connected to the song calum struggled with his sexuality growing up he says dancing on my own became his anthem i didnt really know who i was so when i sang it all those emotions from my past spilled over into the song end of youtube post  by calumscottvevo calums version was released commercially in 2016 and performed better than robyns original reaching number two in the uk singles chart i owe my career to robyn he says he also describes the surreal moment when the two of them met   by chance   at the bbc she walked past and i just froze she came up to me and said it was nice to finally meet me you never expect to meet the person who had the original song no words \u2764\ufe0f @robynkonichiwa a post shared by  calum scott @calumscott on dec 4 2018 at 441am pst end of instagram post  by calumscott robyn says calum and his voice interpreted it in a way that made the song came alive again im super happy for him to have the success and am pleased people got to know the song a little bit more she says there have been so many covers because its a great song but as calum was bringing the song to a far wider audience in the mid 2010s robyn was taking a step back from what shed created dancing on my own sometimes felt like a teenage version of me that i was happy to let go of she says the song came from a break up in her own life and she became tired of the broken heart i went through a lot of therapy worked on myself and healed myself now im back loving it i dont feel conflicted and i love performing it and playing it live end of youtube post  by robyn when robyn toured in 2019 she cut the song just before the chorus leaving thousands of fans to sing her track back at her i was at her gig at londons alexandra palace it was such a goosebump moment to join everyone else singing im in the corner watching you kiss her at the tops of our voices at the time i remember robyn seemed to be genuinely overwhelmed by it its like the song was talking back to me she says by that point she felt the song had moved on from its beginnings and became something that took on meaning for a lot of people in different ways for someone that often writes about heartbreak and emotions robyn says she finds nostalgia and sentimentality difficult those emotions dont always feel true to me and i think dancing on my own has those qualities its maybe a part of the song i had to struggle with but maybe thats why it connects to so many people too in february robyn was named songwriter of the decade at the nme awards an accolade handed to her by christine & the queens and charli xcx charli says robyn continuously evolved in her career but has always stayed true to who she is h\u00e9lo\u00efse letissier of christine & the queens described her songwriting as pop perfection as a songwriter i can only marvel at a song like dancing on my own says letissier its a gem of pop i watched her gig in oslo last year and it was the most cathartic thing i ever saw as we mentioned earlier robyn has a second defining moment of the track it involves her friend and collaborator max martin who himself has co written 22 billboard hot 100 number ones and played an early part in her career on songs like show me love according to robyn she was told by his manager that max thinks its one of the best pop songs ever made and that makes me very happy and proud follow newsbeat on instagram facebook twitter and

        "text": "after a police officer shot and killed greg crocketts best friend he left minnesota for good then in the aftermath of george floyds killing he decided he couldnt stay away how everything and nothing changed after the death of philando castile greg crockett was sitting in the passenger seat of his grandfathers van when he saw that   in the midst of rapidly escalating protests over the death of an unarmed black man named george floyd at the hands of a minneapolis police officer   an auto parts store near his old neighbourhood was on fire although he moved away from minnesota almost two years ago crockett told his grandfather he needed to go in response his grandfather a retired marine quoted che guevara the revolution is not an apple that falls when it is ripe you have to make it fall as crocketts flight descended over the minneapolis st paul international airport an older white woman peered out the window wondering if shed be able to see the fires from the plane that night from nearly the moment his feet hit the pavement crockett   a thin acerbic 37 year old who works at the phoenix international airport   witnessed a rolling carnival of chaos for over two hours until his phone died he captured scene after scene of casual destruction at turns horrifying and darkly comedic a boy who looked no older than 15 or 16 lobbed a molotov cocktail into a grocery store only to have the lit rag fall out and singe his legs a group of 30 people worked furiously to break open a drive through atm until an older man sauntered up at a theatrically slow pace with an enormous sledgehammer over one shoulder a young woman wilted in the street her friends tried to carry her into a car that offered a ride to the hospital but then drove off at the last second without them there was not a police officer in sight the red and blue lights of squad cars glinted blocks away its a beautiful day in the neighbourhood crockett sang through his medical mask he ducked through a looted bank a liquor store a probation office and a mexican restaurant where he found five masked men making themselves burritos like college kids at the end of long night of partying he helped himself to some beers knocked over a beverage dispenser that stained his jeans occasionally he took a swig from a fifth of courvoisier that a looter handed him on the street we out here minnesota the revolution is starting right here he said into the camera we shoulda did this four years ago when they killed philando we shoulda been out here in 2016 back when crockett still lived in minnesota a police officer named jeronimo yanez shot and killed crocketts best friend philando castile when crockett met castile he was a quiet braces wearing video game fanatic the teeth braces came off but by all accounts little else about castile changed he became a well regarded employee of st paul public schools food services division known to students as mr phil to friends he was chedda because he always had a job and always made money yanez pulled castile over in a neighbourhood roughly 15 minutes away from the street where george floyd would die in 2020 after castile informed yanez he had a firearm for which he was properly licensed yanez seemingly panicked firing into the car and hitting castile seven times castiles girlfriend diamond reynolds turned on her facebook live seconds later and captured her dying boyfriends final moments while her four year old daughter watched from the backseat what happened next has become a routine in the us the broadcast went viral castiles name became a hashtag protesters hit the streets all over the country crockett and the rest of the pallbearers donned white suits that matched the one castile wore inside his casket at a funeral that was carried on national television and attended by the governor of minnesota crockett remembers wanting to be angry to be angry the way george floyd protesters are angry now but castiles mother whom crockett calls his auntie told them to be peaceful to let the criminal justice system do its work she asked us to be cool said crockett we held it in we held in our anger we held in our emotions we asked politely manslaughter charges were brought against the officer in which the prosecutor called castile compliant and respectful but less than a year after the killing a jury acquitted yanez the day of the acquittal was at the forefront of crocketts mind as he moved down lake street past decapitated coin operated parking metres and storefronts curtained with flames if there had been an uprising in minneapolis after #philandocastile would there have been a #georgefloyd rip george   none of us knew you crockett said into the camera we shoulda did this four years ago you shouldnt even be dead they wont stop killing us we want you to stop killing us two days later crockett sat in a friends backyard smoking a cigarette and drinking a beer brian mcintosh the homes owner wheeled an old black office chair to the door of the garage and pointed at it this is where castile sat he said two weeks before he died theyd played a game of chess minding his own business mcintosh said response to crocketts facebook live was mixed some cheered him on some scolded him for being a part of a night that left an iconic corridor of south minneapolis gutted by fire water damage and looting challenged about his behaviour crockett was unfazed a lot of people are really quiet folks everything that happens to them they hold it in until they get drunk thats when they let it out he said this is the result this is what yall get you cant keep pushing a person and thinking theyre gonna keep letting you push them no one day theyre going to push back now we pushing back now were drunk a string of bad luck convinced crockett to leave minnesota two years ago he got mugged at gunpoint he got fired he lost his apartment his car got towed with all his belongings not long after that he got on a flight to arizona and vowed not to come back the midwest crockett said is not the same place that his great grandfather moved to in 1947 in the second wave of the great migration their family left west helena arkansas to escape jim crow laws to seek better jobs a better education for their children to achieve homeownership the same type of reasons that the castile family came to minnesota from missouri the same reasons george floyd moved up from houston texas but the midwest changed the factories shut and the schools got more segregated and the quality of life gap between black and white midwesterners got wider and wider crocketts parents fled gary indiana a troubled town that cratered when the steel industry left they bounced around from indiana to wisconsin to minnesota he attended nine elementary schools and four middle schools before they settled in st paul castile wasnt even the first person crockett knew who was killed by police   his uncle darryl burns was killed by an indianapolis police officer in 1992 at a traffic stop crockett was 10 he has flashes of it in his memory the phone call his mother took in the kitchen a trip to indianapolis to find out what happened his uncles monte carlo strafed with bullet holes at this point crocketts views have grown bleak he no longer believes that a life sentence for his friends killer would have prevented another death like george floyds hes no longer sure he believes that peaceful integration is even possible he feels that black people in america are essentially stateless people talk about we gonna fight back we cant fight back when were on enemy land he said talking about it is overwhelming im tired he said his eyes welling up im so expletive tired after philando died crockett said all he did was work he made good money but stopped paying his credit card bills he coped by drinking he moved through life as if in a metaphorical blackout but now for the first time in four years at the intersection of lake street and chicago with flames leaping from the buildings on all sides crockett felt something different something he knows others will find offensive i feel great he said i feel alive with his airport job on an indefinite hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic crockett is buying up super cheap plane tickets from minneapolis he flies to nashville tennessee from there hell go to atlanta georgia then its on to cleveland ohio and the nations capitol washington dc im gonna talk everywhere i go he said im going to represent philando everywhere i go he said he wants to see the revolution first hand all it takes is one little spark to light everything the expletive up and thats what happened minneapolis   this little bitty ass place he said its so beautiful its so beautiful its absolutely beautiful"
