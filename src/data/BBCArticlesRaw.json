Writing in the Telegraph, Boris Johnson said he was setting up a commission to look at all \"aspects of inequality\". He said \"no-one who cares about this country\" could ignore the anti-racist demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd in US police custody. However, he said the UK's heritage must be left \"broadly in peace\". Mr Johnson also condemned the \"far-right thugs\" involved in violent protests on Saturday, which saw more than 100 people arrested in London after thousands gathered saying they were protecting statues. He said their mission was \"utterly absurd\" but he added that it was \"deplorable\" that Sir Winston Churchill's statue had been in danger of attack. It comes after the statue in Parliament Square was spray-painted with the words \"was a racist\" last weekend. In Bristol, anti-racism protesters pulled down a statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The PM said he was setting up a commission to look at inequality as it was \"no use just saying that we have made huge progress in tackling racism\". He wrote: \"There is much more that we need to do; and we will. It is time for a cross-governmental commission to look at all aspects of inequality - in employment, in health outcomes, in academic and all other walks of life.\" Questions over inequality in health outcomes have been repeatedly raised during the coronavirus pandemic after figures showed more people from ethnic minority backgrounds were \"disproportionately\" dying with the virus. Thousands have people have marched in the UK as part of Black Lives Matter demonstrations following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. Mr Johnson said that \"the serious points\" being raised by the anti-racist demonstrators should be taken seriously. However, he said that did not mean \"wasting time\" disputing the life and opinions of \"every historical personality currently immortalised in bronze or stone\". \"Let's fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace. If we really want to change it, there are democratic means available in this country - thanks, by the way, to Winston Churchill,\" he said."

        "text": "\"People should shop, and shop with confidence\" when non-essential stores reopen in England on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said retail staff were \"excited\" and had done \"a huge amount of work\" to allow for safer shopping. But he said people must continue to respect social distancing measures. It comes as a further 36 deaths from coronavirus were announced in the past 24 hours. It brings the UK death toll - across all settings - to 41,698. The latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 March, but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend, because of a reporting lag. While food shops and pharmacies, as well as other essential retailers including banks and petrol stations, have been open throughout lockdown, non-essential stores, such as book shops and fashion outlets, have been shuttered since 23 March. The prime minister said he was \"very optimistic about the opening [of shops]\", but stressed \"the most important thing is public safety and the health of our country\". He said it was difficult to tell whether there would be \"a huge wave... or a trickle\" of customers on Monday, but urged the public returning to the shops \"to observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely\". With \"fewer than 1 in 1000 cases in the population\", people had made \"a huge sacrifice...and we can't throw it away\", Mr Johnson said. By Katy Austin, business correspondent Not all shops will raise the shutters on day one: the reopening will be gradual. But for many, it's an important opportunity to welcome spending customers back in store. Having spent time and money preparing safety measures, in line with \"Covid-secure\" guidelines, shop owners are hoping the public will have the confidence to return, and that they will follow rules on queuing and hygiene. Some expect an initial surge of activity; others expect much lower levels of trade in the coming months, compared to before the crisis. One reason is that social distancing will limit the number of customers in store, another is that the experience will be different. There will be less spontaneous browsing, for example, and no relaxing at a caf\u00e9 or restaurant while most hospitality venues remain closed. The lockdown also accelerated the move towards online shopping, with fewer physical stores likely to be needed in future. Mr Johnson's comments echoed those of Chancellor Rishi Sunak who earlier praised retailers' \"extraordinary\" efforts to create a 'Covid-secure' environment. From Monday, most retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines. Those who fail to ensure their premises are Covid-secure could face enforcement notices. Plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft 5ins) apart - already a regular fixture in supermarkets - will be a key feature. Other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use. It comes as Mr Johnson faces increased pressure to ease the 2m social distancing rule, which many ministers see as crucial to the further reopening of the economy. Mr Sunak told the BBC the government would \"actively\" look again at the measure, given its \"enormous impact\" on the profitability of businesses. \"You are right to highlight the impact it has on business - it is the difference between maybe three-quarters and a third of pubs opening, for example, so it is important we look at it.\" It is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 July - currently the earliest mooted date for the reopening of pubs, bars, restaurants and hairdressers in England. While other countries have enforced a lesser distance of 1m (just over 3ft), in keeping with the World Health Organization's recommendation,  the UK government's scientific advisers have so far maintained that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. \"Ultimately it is for ministers [to decide],\" said Mr Sunak. \"We are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country. People should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions.\" The chancellor acknowledged many people would be \"anxious\" at the prospect of going out shopping again after almost three months in lockdown. But he stressed \"it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence\". \"Shops up and down the country are desperate to welcome us all back and I think we all want to see our High Streets spring back to life again,\" he said. Designer men's clothing retailer Brother2Brother will be reopening its Reading store on Monday for the first time since March. Buying director Steven Hall said the firm \"could not wait\" to reopen, although the shopping experience might be different from what customers are used to - with staff provided with PPE and a limit of six customers at a time. In addition to \"cleaning of counters after every purchase [and] cleaning of the changing rooms after use... we will also have to quarantine the goods for at least 24 hours before they are put back into circulation\". He added that customers will be encouraged to try things on at home and return them where possible and \"pretty much everything\" will be given a sale price as the company looks to shift its seasonal stock. One way the store is attempting to drum up business is by letting customers book 30-minute slots, allowing staff to prepare a selection of items suited to their tastes. \"If we don't try to innovate and make sure business can operate at some sort of level we probably wouldn't be here for very long,\" Mr Hall said. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY. And Andrew Goodacre, chief executive of The British Independent Retailers Association, believes people may \"soon become weary of queuing\". The British Retail Consortium (BRC), the trade body for retailers, is urging the public to \"play their part\" in making shopping safer.

        "text": "A 20-year-old man has died, a woman has been raped and three people have been stabbed during two illegal \"quarantine raves\" that attracted 6,000 people. Thousands flocked to Daisy Nook Country Park and Carrington in Greater Manchester late on Saturday. The man at the country park died of a suspected drug overdose and the stabbings and the attack on an 18-year-old woman took place in Carrington. Police said the illegal raves have had tragic consequences. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes condemned them as a clear breach of coronavirus legislation, adding officers \"were met with violence, resulting in items being thrown and a police car being vandalised\". Police said about 4,000 people were at the Daisy Nook rave in Failsworth, Oldham, where there were no reported crimes. There were, however, three separate stabbings at the Carrington site - one of which left an 18-year-old man with life-threatening injuries. Police were able to find the man and give him first aid before paramedics arrived. Two other men, aged 25 and 26, were hurt in separate stabbings and a 25-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon. \"We are also investigating the rape of an 18-year-old woman... and we have specialist officers supporting her and her family,\" police said. Streams of young people were seen on their way to an area just off Common Lane in Carrington on Saturday evening. There was a large police presence at both sites. Images and footage were also shared on social media showing densely-packed crowds of people dancing and singing at the outdoor raves. A large sign reading \"Quarantine Rave\" can be seen in background of one video. Anyone with footage that could help with inquiries has been asked to contact police. Sacha Lord, who is the night-time economy adviser for the region, said those that had attended had put themselves and those they loved at risk. Mr Lord tweeted: \"I've seen some of the footage. You aren't clubbers. Just selfish idiots.\" If you are one of the morons who attended one of the illegal raves in Partington and Daisy Nook last night, you are a disgrace. You\u2019ve now put yourselves, your friends, your families and loved ones at risk. I\u2019ve seen some of the footage. You aren\u2019t clubbers. Just selfish idiots. End of Twitter post  by @Sacha_Lord The MP for Ashton-Under-Lyne, Angela Rayner, said she had joined Oldham Street Angels at the Daisy Nook site during the rave. The group offers support and pastoral care to partygoers and others that need it during the night-time. Ms Rayner tweeted that she had \"just finished my shift at Street Angels in Oldham\" and had been \"dealing with the illegal rave at Daisy Nook liaising with the police\". Just finished my shift at Street Angels in Oldham. Dealing with the illegal rave at Daisy Nook liaising with the police. Mark was seen tonight who lost his partner a few weeks back. He wasn\u2019t in a good way. We gave 33 meals and 6 sleeping bags for those who had no accommodation. End of Twitter post  by @AngelaRayner Volunteers spent Sunday morning clearing away rubbish left scattered across the fields at the Daisy Nook site with help from Oldham Council. Empty bottles, plastic bags, gas canisters and abandoned gazebos cluttered the beauty spot. Oldham Council leader Sean Fielding tweeted his thanks to the \"dozens of volunteers\". Dozens of volunteers there this morning helping to clean up the mess left by the latter of these. Not any easy place to get to. Equally not going to be an easy, or cheap place to clear all the rubbish from. Thanks, guys. https://t.co/tMtWihLETp End of Twitter post  by @cllrsfielding The region's deputy mayor for policing and crime, Bev Hughes, said the events industry had agreed \"to blacklist any supplier who is involved with illegal raves\". She said \"those reckless individuals\" have \"put a needless demand on vital police time,\" and \"themselves and their communities in real danger\". But she praised communities helping clean up, saying: \"We have seen the real Greater Manchester this morning.\" ACC Sykes responded to suggestions police had been slow to act or allowed the events to go ahead in a lengthy statement on the force's website. Greater Manchester Police had seen huge demand including a 60% surge in emergency calls from 17:00 BST on Saturday to 04:00 on Sunday, he said. He said said the gatherings were carefully monitored but \"we needed to balance the present public health emergency and our overall demand with ongoing incidents\" during the pandemic.

        "text": "PM Boris Johnson has commissioned a review into the 2m social distancing rule, the chancellor has confirmed. Mr Johnson said there was \"margin for manoeuvre\" in the 2m rule as the number of coronavirus cases falls. Rishi Sunak told the BBC the government would \"actively\" look again at the measure, given its \"enormous impact\" on the profitability of businesses. It is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 July, when pubs and restaurants could open in England. Mr Johnson said: \"As we get the numbers down, so it becomes one in 1,000, one in 1,600, maybe even fewer, your chances of being two metres, or one metre, or even a foot away from somebody who has the virus is obviously going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre.\" The chancellor added he would like to see the rule relaxed, if \"safe and responsible\" to do so. Ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the evidence \"already shows that it is wholly feasible to move to 1m\". \"If other countries are doing it successfully, we need to move now,\" he added. The review, which was first reported in the Mail on Sunday, will take evidence from scientists as well as economists, Mr Sunak confirmed. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, Mr Sunak said \"many other countries\" had a rule less than 2m and the review would \"look at the issue in the round\". \"Much as I would like to see it reduced - everyone would like to see that reduced from an economic perspective - we can only do that if it's safe and responsible to do so,\" he said. He added that scientists had made clear there is a \"different degree of risk at different levels,\" and the decision on relaxing it is \"ultimately\" for ministers to make. The UK government currently advises people to stay 2m (6ft 6in) apart from others to avoid spreading coronavirus. This is further than the World Health Organization's recommendation of at least 1m (just over 3ft), and some other countries like France and Denmark. But the UK government's scientific advisers say that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. However, there are widespread concerns about the impact of the rule on the UK economy, which is already suffering from the pandemic. Some bars, restaurants and pubs say they will be unable to make a profit if the 2m guidance is still in place when they reopen. Tourism firms have also warned of tens of thousands of job losses unless the distance is shortened. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the industry body UK Hospitality, says that with a 2m rule, outlets would be only able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would increase that to 60-75%. Richard Caring, chairman of Caprice Holdings which runs the Ivy, told the Mail on Sunday the government was  \"killing the country\". \"There are estimates saying we could have up to five million unemployed,\" he said. \"It's not going to be five million - it's going to be more. I don't think we've seen anything yet.\" Mr Johnson is also under pressure from some of his own MPs to reduce the 2m rule over concerns it would made it difficult for firms to turn a profit after they reopen. Sir Iain said the review should be \"swift,\" and called on the prime minister to reduce the rule now \"for the good of the economy\". \"Whether there is a review or not, it will come down to a political judgment for the prime minister to make,\" he added. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said Labour would support a relaxation of the 2m rule if the evidence showed it was \"the right time to do it\". Also speaking on the Andrew Marr programme, he said the government should \"follow the science,\" and be \"frank and honest with the public on balancing risk\". He added: \"I think the government's been slow, slow on testing, slow on lockdown, slow on PPE [personal protective equipment], and I suspect they'll be slow again on this\". The 2m distance has been implemented by all nations of the UK, which have their own powers over restrictions. But so far, political leaders have rejected calls to relax the 2m rule. Earlier this week, Scotland's chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith said the evidence was \"incontrovertible\" that the risk of transmitting the virus increased the closer you got to someone. He said it was a \"balanced and sensible precaution\" to ensure transmission is reduced. And Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said the medical advice suggested 2m apart was the \"safest place to be\". While pubs, bars and restaurants could open in England from 4 July, no date has been given in Scotland, Wales or NI. From Monday, all non-essential shops in England will be allowed to reopen - as long as they enforce the 2m guidance among shoppers and staff. In Northern Ireland, all shops were allowed to open from Friday. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown. The UK government has repeatedly said it is constantly reviewing its coronavirus lockdown guidance."

        "text": "Portuguese police say the German evidence against the new suspect in the Madeleine McCann case is \"significant\". A senior police source also told the BBC they were keen to cooperate in the investigation into the disappearance of the British girl in Portugal in 2007. The new suspect is a 43-year-old German man, named in reports as Christian B, who is in prison in Germany. He was revealed as the main suspect earlier this month, as German and UK police made a fresh appeal for help. The convicted paedophile is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, aged three, was last seen while on holiday in Portugal. A senior Portuguese police source, who has seen the German evidence against Christian B, has told the BBC it is \"very important\" and \"significant\". The source also rejected criticism that their procedures were slow, amid reports that the German authorities have privately been critical of their Portuguese counterparts. Another source close to the investigation said Portuguese police accepted that Christian B was now a suspect. Asked whether they had access to his previous convictions for child sexual offences at the time of Madeleine's disappearance, he said it was important not to judge the past with the benefit of hindsight, and that police systems since then had changed. Some of those who knew the German suspect during his time in Portugal have criticised the investigation as \"very slow\", telling the BBC that they were only approached by police - either British or Portuguese - in the past year or two. Several people remembered Christian B as angry and untrustworthy, with one neighbour saying he squatted in a nearby house without paying rent, and left it \"ransacked\" in a terrible state when he departed, two years before Madeleine's disappearance. By BBC news correspondent Lucy Williamson, in Praia da Luz When German police - newcomers to the Madeleine McCann investigation - announced they had evidence that indicated the toddler was dead, it seemed to get a cautious response from their Portuguese and British counterparts. British police stuck to their line that it was a \"missing person inquiry\", and the impression from Portuguese media was that their own tight-lipped authorities were staying open-minded. This first-hand confirmation from a senior Portuguese police source that the German evidence is \"very important\" and \"significant\" is a sign of how seriously this new development is being taken there. There's been plenty of mutual recrimination between the British and Portuguese forces in the 13 years since Madeleine McCann vanished from her family's holiday apartment. Now a third country has entered the quest for answers. Awkward? Maybe. But the German evidence, it seems, is convincing enough for the Portuguese police to signal their support. After living for so long under the pressure of unanswered questions, they won't want to be left out of a development that might promise some answers. German prosecutors have previously said they have evidence that leads them to believe Christian B killed Madeleine, but it wasn't strong enough to take him to court. Police say the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve in Portugal between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. The suspect is currently serving a jail term in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein, for drug-dealing, having been extradited from Portugal in July 2017. He is believed to have been in the Praia da Luz area in May 2007, when Madeleine went missing while on a family holiday with her parents and siblings. In December 2019, the man was sentenced to seven years for raping a 72-year-old American woman in the same Portuguese resort in 2005. The Metropolitan Police, who are working with their German and Portuguese counterparts, have said the case remained a \"missing persons\" investigation in the UK because there was no \"definitive evidence\" as to whether Madeleine was alive or not. Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz, while her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Her disappearance sparked a huge and costly police hunt across much of Europe - the most recent Met Police investigation, which began in 2011, has cost more than \u00a311m."

A leaked Public Health England draft cited racism as a possible factor in why people of such backgrounds are at increased risk of dying of the virus. Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said it was \"horrifying\". Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the report would be published next week. The review, the second by PHE on the subject, pointed to discrimination as a root cause affecting health and the risk of both exposure to the virus and becoming seriously ill as a result of it. It found that historic racism may mean people were less likely to seek care or demand better personal protective equipment, while other potential factors included risks linked to occupation and inequalities in conditions such as diabetes. Mr Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham, told The Andrew Marr Show it was hard for black and Asian people not to know someone who had died from the virus, adding that his uncle and a classmate had lost their lives. \"But the point is it is a scandal if one week Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock say black lives matter and then we find out today that they have buried part of the review that had the recommendations in it to do something about it,\" he said. \"It is no wonder why people are upset, this is a very, very serious business, the statistics are grim, again, you are in government do something about it - save lives.\" Chancellor Rishi Sunak refused to comment on the leaked report but said he believed it was due to be formally published next week. Mr Lammy also told Andrew Marr that the prime minister's tweets about Winston Churchill's statue, and the risk to it from anti-racism protesters, were a deflection from the issues at hand. He said: \"He's never tweeted eight times in a day on coronavirus, he's never tweeted eight times in a day on the Windrush review or what he's going to do about it, or on the review that David Cameron asked me to do on disproportionality in the criminal justice system and what he's going to do about it. \"This feels to me like a bit of a deflection. Let's get to the action, let's have some substance, let's do something about these historic injustices that still exist in our country.\" A recent review confirmed that the risk of death from Covid-19 is higher for ethnic minorities. PHE found that people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at twice the rate of white Britons, while other black, Asian and minority ethnic groups had between 10% and 50% higher risk of death. Hospital trusts and other health service bodies have been asked to prioritise risk assessments for BAME staff and other vulnerable groups.

Armed officers stormed the home of Paul and Elaine Gait in December 2018, and held them for 36 hours after drones caused the airport to close repeatedly. The couple were released without charge, and sued Sussex Police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment. The Gait's legal team said the force had agreed an out-of-court settlement. Sussex Police confirmed it has paid the couple the \u00a355,000 owed in damages, and law firm Howard Kennedy said it has billed the force an additional \u00a3145,000 in legal costs. Flights were cancelled in droves over a three-day period, as police investigated multiple reported drone sightings. No-one has ever been charged, and police have said that some reported drone sightings may have been Sussex Police's own craft. Twelve armed officers swooped on Mr and Mrs Gait's home, even though they did not possess any drones and had been at work during the reported sightings. In a statement released by their legal team on Sunday, the couple said: \"We are delighted to have finally received vindication, it has been a very long fight for justice. \"It has taken lengthy legal proceedings to obtain resolution from the police and to finally have closure on this distressing time.\" In a letter to the couple, Sussex Police Assistant Chief Constable David Miller said he was \"deeply sorry\" for the \"unpleasantness\" the couple experienced, and acknowledged it would have been \"traumatic\". He added: \"Unfortunately, when the police carry out their functions on behalf of the public, sometimes innocent people are arrested as part of necessary police investigations in the public interest. \"However, we recognise that things could have been done differently and, as a result, Sussex Police have agreed to pay you compensation and legal costs.\" The force commissioned a \"thorough independent review\" of the drone incident last year.

Popular for his acting in both TV and film, Rajput is perhaps best known for MS Dhoni: The Untold Story, where he played the legendary cricketer. Many have been paying tributes to Rajput, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who called him \"a bright young actor gone too soon\". Rajput's death comes just days after that of his former manager. Born in the eastern state of Bihar, Rajput dropped out of a university course in engineering to pursue a career in acting and dance. His Bollywood breakthrough came in the 2013 film Kai Po Che, which won acclaim at the Berlin film festival. The actor's last film was Chhichhore, which was released last year. The film's director Nitesh Tiwari said he had spoken to Rajput last week. \"I am at a loss for words. I spoke to him last week over messages. We would text each other on and off. Now this is what I get to hear. He was like a younger brother to me,\" he told the Press Trust of India (PTI). In his last post to his 10.2 million Instagram followers on 3 June, Rajput posted a picture of his late mother, who died in 2002, when he was a teenager, according to PTI.

Non-essential retailers, such as fashion, toy and book shops, will be allowed to reopen in England on 15 June - as long as they have coronavirus-related safety measures in place. Waterstones, for example, is introducing Perspex \"sneeze screens\" and a quarantine trolley where books that have been browsed will be held for \"a couple of days\". \"We want to keep bookshop experience exactly as it normally would be,\" says Annie. \"We're still encouraging people to browse, we're just looking after those books once you've browsed them.\" Annie has been working on implementing those changes behind-the-scenes, but is also looking forward to seeing her colleagues back in-store. \"Bookshops are quite close teams... We've been messaging, but it's not quite the same as seeing colleagues in person for a chat, particularly about the books you've been reading on furlough.\" Suki, who works at a Boots beauty hall in London, also says that it's \"refreshing to come back to work, which is like my second home\". Most Boots stores have remained open during lockdown. That means that staff on the beauty counter have had the chance to trial different ways of working about a week before shoppers return to the High Street. Boots is removing all make-up testers, and assistants will wear plastic visors in its beauty halls, to try to keep both customers and staff safe. Suki acknowledges that some changes could make shopping more difficult. That there won't be testers is \"going to be a shock for a lot of us, because with beauty you often need to try things on,\" she said. \"The visor isn't the most glamorous thing in the world, but it does mean that I'm not touching my face and my make-up can stay on longer. And, safety isn't supposed to be glamorous,\" she adds. Overall, Suki feels as though she's in a safe pair of hands: \"We're all as nervous as each other, so I think as long as we all take the necessary steps, we'll be fine.\" Shoppers, though, might be feeling more anxious about their return to the High Street. More than half of UK customers expect they will now go shopping less often over the next one or two years, according to a survey of more than 1,000 people by accountancy giant EY. One trade body, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), is urging the public to \"play their part\" in making shopping safer. Along with 25 other retailers, it says customers should follow five steps: Helen Dickinson, the BRC's chief executive, said: \"Every visit we make helps support jobs in retail, as well as throughout the supply chain. Retailers have been working around the clock to create a safe shopping environment\". \"Our shopping experience may be changing, but if we all follow the necessary social distancing measures and show a little consideration to those around us, then everyone will be better off.\" Her plea was echoed by Damian McLoughlin, chief executive of Homebase. \"While the vast majority of our customers have adhered to the safety measures we have in store, in recent weeks, a small minority of shoppers are disobeying the guidelines set out and at times reacting abusively when challenged by store teams,\" he said. \"It's for this reason we're calling on members of the public to help us reverse the trend that saw cases of abusive incidents towards shop workers rise by 9% during the last year.\" For any customers who don't want to go into a store, HMV will offer to do their shopping for them. From Monday, people can drop in a shopping list, a team member will collect it, package it up and have it waiting for the customer to pick up later. Alternatively, customers can ring their local HMV to have a product put aside for them to collect later on. The idea came from the chain's Canadian customers who have been a little bit more cautious about returning to stores as opposed to its US shoppers, says its owner Doug Putman. So what does he expect from customers in England when HMV opens 93 shops on Monday? Read more here. Many retailers in England will soon open their doors for the first time since lockdown measures were introduced in March. No dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland and Wales, although each country has set out its planned stages for lifting lockdown. Those in Northern Ireland have been open since Friday. John Lewis stores in Poole and Kingston will be the first to reopen on 15 June, followed by another 11 shops later that week. Marks & Spencer will also reopen the majority of its clothing stores. Primark has also announced that it will reopen all 153 of its stores in England on Monday. Meanwhile, Debenhams will open 50 shops in England. The firm collapsed for the second time in a year in April after coronavirus ramped up the pressures facing the business. It has struck deals with landlords to keep 120 stores open. However, 17 of its stores will remain closed for good when coronavirus lockdown restrictions are lifted. It is still in discussions over a \"handful\" of others. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said: \"The survival of so many retailers will hinge on the success of reopening stores over the coming weeks and the pace at which consumers return.\" Mr Lim also pointed out that the \"significant shift\" towards online seen during lockdown may change shopping habits for good. \"Many of these consumers are shopping for goods online for the first time, overcoming the barriers of setting up online accounts, entering payment details and gaining trust. It is inevitable that some of these behaviours will become sticky,\" he said. Former John Lewis boss and current mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, told Sky News he hopes to see a permanent reform to business rates, a kind of council tax businesses pay. He is also keen on proposals for a digital sales tax for online retailers, \"making sure online companies pay a fair share,\" he said. For physical shops, a rare ray of sunshine from the lockdown could be customers wanting to visit local shops as they work from home and spend more time near their homes, he added. \"I do believe one of the things to come out of this is a concentration on local areas,\" he told Sky."

        "text": "A woman has hatched three ducklings called Beep, Peep and Meep from eggs she bought in Waitrose. Charli Lello, 29, from Hertfordshire, put the Clarence Court eggs in an incubator as an experiment to pass the time after being furloughed. She said the ducklings would live \"a very happy life\" with her pet chickens. A Waitrose spokesman said fertilised eggs were safe to eat and \"entirely indistinguishable\" from normal eggs, unless incubated. Ms Lello, who normally works as an assistant manager in a shop, got the idea after seeing a video on Facebook of someone hatching quail eggs from a supermarket. \"While I was in Waitrose, I saw the duck eggs and thought maybe they would work as well. I was so excited for them to hatch but I still had in the back of my mind that these are supermarket eggs. \"They have been collected, bashed around on a delivery truck, then rattled around on a trolley onto a shelf, picked up and put down by who knows how many people, so they still might not go all the way.\" A month after putting them in the incubator, Ms Lello heard a tiny beeping sound and the Braddock White ducklings started to emerge from their shells. She said it had been an \"amazing\" experience hatching the \"cutest little balls of fluff\" but she would not be repeating it. \"The only reason I could try was because I am currently furloughed and have the time to raise them to an age where they won't need me all day. Under normal circumstances it wouldn't have been possible or fair on them,\" she said. A Waitrose spokesman said it was \"notoriously difficult\" to identify the sex of white-feathered ducks. \"Our farmers work hard to ensure ducks and drakes are separated correctly. As a result of this difficulty in sexing, a male white-feathered duck may very occasionally be left with a group of females, although, these instances are extremely rare. \"There may also be instances when a wild duck encounters farmed drakes, but again, this is rare,\" he said. A spokeswoman for Clarence Court Farms said: \"It is a feat of remarkably slim odds that a duckling has been hatched. But we acknowledge that it's not impossible.\" Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. If you have a story suggestion email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk"

        "text": "There's been criticism of a study from the US suggesting that the coronavirus could have been present in the Chinese city of Wuhan as early as August last year. The study by Harvard University, which gained significant publicity when it was released earlier this month, has been dismissed by China and had its methodology challenged by independent scientists. The research, which hasn't been peer-reviewed, is based on satellite imagery of traffic movements around hospitals in Wuhan and the tracking of online searches for specific medical symptoms. It says there was a noticeable rise in vehicles parking outside six hospitals in the city from late August to 1 December 2019. This coincided, says the Harvard report, with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as \"cough\" and \"diarrhoea\". This would be an important finding because the earliest reported case in Wuhan wasn't until the beginning of December. The academics write: \"While we cannot confirm if the increased volume was directly related to the new virus, our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the Huanan Seafood market.\" The Harvard study has gained a lot of traction in the media, with President Trump, who has been highly critical of China's pandemic response, tweeting a Fox News item highlighting the researchers' findings. The tweet has been viewed more than three million times. The study claims there was an increase in online queries for coronavirus symptoms, particularly \"diarrhoea\", on popular Chinese search engine Baidu. However, Baidu company officials have disputed their findings, saying there was in fact a decrease in searches for \"diarrhoea\" over this period. So, what's going on? The term used in the Harvard University paper actually translates from Chinese as \"symptom of diarrhoea\". We checked this on Baidu's tool that allows users to analyse the popularity of search queries, like Google Trends. The search-term \"symptom of diarrhoea\" does indeed show an increase in queries from August 2019. However, we also ran the term \"diarrhoea\", a more common search-term in Wuhan, and it actually showed a decrease from August 2019 until the outbreak began. A lead author of the Harvard paper, Benjamin Rader, told the BBC that \"the search term we chose for 'diarrhoea' was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of Covid-19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus\". We also looked at the popularity of searches for \"fever\" and \"difficulty in breathing\", two other common symptoms of coronavirus. Searches for \"fever\" increased a small amount after August at a similar rate to \"cough\", and queries for \"difficulty in breathing\" decreased in the same period. There have also been questions raised about the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease. A large-scale UK study of nearly 17,000 coronavirus patients found that diarrhoea was the seventh most common symptom, well below the top three: cough, fever and shortness of breath. Across the six hospitals, the Harvard study reported a rise in cars in hospital parking lots from August to December 2019. However, we've found some serious flaws in their analysis. The report states that images with tree cover and building shadows were excluded to avoid over or under-counting of vehicles. However, satellite images released to the media show large areas of hospital car parks blocked by tall buildings which means that it's not possible to accurately assess the number of cars present. In the tweet below, we've annotated with white boxes the areas obscured by the tall buildings. The angle of the images shown in the @ABC report on this block out portions of the parking space that would  tarnish the data relied upon to suggest a trend in cars present in the hospital parking spaces. H/T to @Fang__z for first highlighting this. pic.twitter.com/odtCflBOt8 End of Twitter post  by @BenDoBrown There's also an underground car park at Tianyou Hospital, which is visible on Baidu's street view function, but only the entrance is in view on satellite imagery - not the cars underneath the ground. One of the authors of the study, Benjamin Rader said \"we definitely can't account for underground parking in any time period of the study and this is one of the limitations of this type of research.\" Fundamental flaw in @Harvard's report in looking at cars at hospitals to suggest early COVID signs was failure to look at underground parking. Here is entrance to Tianyou Hospital underground carpark. In 2017 it was full: https://t.co/didhH35M9a H/T @crushspread & @Wanyuan_Song pic.twitter.com/c5mUpay2wd End of Twitter post 2 by @BenDoBrown There are also concerns about the choice of hospitals for the study. Hubei Women and Children's hospital is one of the sites included, but children rarely require hospital treatment for coronavirus. In response, the authors say their findings would still show increased car park usage overall even if this hospital were to be excluded from the survey. The researchers could also have compared their data with hospitals in other Chinese cities, to see if the rises in traffic and search queries were specific to Wuhan, being where the outbreak first came to light. Without that comparison, in addition to the questions we've raised about online searches for medical symptoms, the evidence for Wuhan residents receiving treatment for coronavirus from August last year remains highly contestable. There is, however, still much we don't know about the early spread of the virus in Wuhan. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"

        "text": "As some Year 10 and Year 12 pupils in England prepare to go back to school on Monday, secondary head teachers are having to overcome an array of challenges. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements will vary widely. More than 300 schools and colleges told us they were mainly offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Some are making the return gradual, starting with pupils who are struggling the most, with many providing individual pastoral sessions to check on mental health. The Sixth Form Colleges Association says schools and colleges should ensure that extending face-to-face teaching does not impact on support for pupils who are still at home. At Ivybridge Community College on the southern slopes of Dartmoor in Devon, principal Rachel Hutchinson has been putting the final touches to plans for welcoming back just over a quarter of the college's 2,500 students. The Year 10 and 12 pupils who will be doing their GCSEs and A-levels next year will return to a very different school from the one they last saw in March. \"Safety measures are key,\" says Mrs Hutchinson. \"We're working very much with social distancing measures... looking very much at the timetable and what we can do safely and sensibly.\" But she's also determined to give them an \"effective education\". Pupils arrive by school bus, public bus and train, some are dropped off, while others walk or cycle. New mask-wearing and social distancing rules on public transport, plus a ban on sixth-formers car sharing, mean clear communication is key, she says. Each school bus can now carry just seven students, which means that, while bringing back a quarter of the pupils is feasible, larger numbers might be impossible, she says. At Ivybridge, even these smaller numbers of students will have to be part-time to ensure safety. It means only about 100 will be in at any one time, with only 10 in each class. For Year 10s, there will be one full day of teaching each week, with 90 minutes each of maths, English and science. The other subjects will continue to be taught remotely on the days pupils are at home. \"They'll still get their full curriculum,\" says Mrs Hutchinson. The post-16 students will have seminar days to reduce movement around the site. They'll get two full days of each A-level over the five weeks before the end of term, says Mrs Hutchinson. \"We think it's very viable, its do-able and it's really important for their education.\" There are 2m distancing markers along all the corridors and a one-way system. Staff in high-vis jackets will monitor every entrance, there are hand-sanitising stations and lots of posters and banners to remind children not to crowd each other. \"It's going to be that supermarket feel - when you go to a supermarket for the first time with the trolley queues,\" she says. With reduced numbers, it's manageable, she says, but increased numbers of students would present a challenge. \"I'd like to think as a college we've been really strong on our pastoral care,\" says Mrs Hutchinson. Tutors have had lots of email contact with students, with fun, remote activities like cake-baking to keep pupils engaged with the school community. However, she recognises some will have fallen behind and so there is a recovery programme to help them catch up. She says a key aim of returning to school is to ensure pupils' wellbeing and she will keep a particular eye out for socially disadvantaged children. About 30 children have opted to take up the college's offer of one-to-one tutoring, with support available for families who have suffered bereavement or illness or are anxious, she says. One of the most important aspects is \"getting it right for my staff\", she says. \"They are absolutely working round the clock to maintain communication, the pastoral welfare and wellbeing of the children, as well as checking in on the learning.\" Some have their own health issues, many will be running busy households without childcare and may feel anxious about returning to face-to-face teaching. \"It's managing staff welfare and making sure that staff feel safe and are ready to come back to work,\" she says. Years 7, 8 and 9 will continue to be taught virtually and pupils in Years 11 and 13, whose exams were cancelled will still get support. \"It's keeping an eye on a number of schools really; our virtual school as well as the new school that's going to be returning. \"The exciting thing is, for the first time ever, children are saying they miss school,\" says Mrs Hutchinson. Getting the college back to a \"new normal for September,\" is another challenge. It will be welcoming the new Year 7s, plus a huge group who have not been in school since March. Mrs Hutchinson says that unless the distancing measures are amended, schools will have to run a blend of classroom lessons and virtual learning in September. She believes the idea of schools opening over the summer, when staff have already been flat out since March is \"quite controversial\". \"The summer six weeks are going to be key for us to get ready for September,\" she argues - and many staff will have to work through to prepare. \"So to open for children in as well will be incredibly challenging,\" she says. She hopes both children and teachers can take their normal summer holidays, ready for a new start, whatever form it will take. Wales will begin opening schools on 29 June, with Scotland and Northern Ireland waiting until August."

        "text": "When Cheveay Oakley moved from London to Cornwall with her mother at six years old, she had never experienced any racism. But with the predominant ethnic group in Cornwall being \"White\" - accounting for 98.2% of the population - and the south-west region being the least diverse in England, she began to face challenges she had never even thought about. From having racial slurs shouted at her from passing cars to being singled out in class when the history of slave trading was being taught, Cheveay, 20, explains in her own words what it was like to grow up as a black person in one of England's whitest places. I was born and originally lived in London. When I was six years old, I moved to Camborne in Cornwall with my mum, Ali. That's where her family lived so we did it to be closer to them. My mum is white and my dad is Jamaican but it wasn't until we moved to the south-west that I encountered my first racism experience. I was in year two and must have been about seven or eight years old in infant school. I had been in Cornwall for about a year or so. Some boy called me a brownie. I was so confused about the fact he would use it a lot to tease me. This isn't only my first memory of racism, it's my first memory ever. I remember my mum came into the school to address it and how the mother of this boy started crying. She was really upset and felt really guilty. I had gone to school in London before this so I'd gone to nursery and reception there. A lot of my classmates were from all over the world. Then to come to Cornwall and be the only black child - I was not used to this sort of thing. I had never even thought of it. It made me think 'What's wrong with me?' and then I was suddenly aware of being different in that area. My mum struggled with how to explain it all to me. She had to tell me that I might have to face this kind of stuff in my life. People saying these things and making judgements based on my skin colour. I did struggle with fitting in with particular groups as I got older. I don't know whether that was predominantly because I was black though. As a person generally, I was quite isolated in that sense as well. I moved friendship groups a lot and didn't really enjoy school. We barely covered any black history at secondary school, except for one topic on the slave trade when I was about 14 or 15 years old. It resulted in a teacher singling me out in front of the whole class of white students asking me how I felt to be the only black child. I just remember this sinking feeling. I was already very aware I was the only black child in that classroom. I was really embarrassed and felt naked. I remember my mum being very upset about it. There were so many occasions that have stuck with me. I remember having the N-word shouted at me from passing cars. This happened on multiple occasions. It was humiliating. There were people who said \"I've never been with a black girl\" or who felt they could continue to ask more personal questions. I was scared to meet people's parents in case they didn't like me or judged. Cornwall is a beautiful place, with some beautiful people who are so accepting and without prejudice, but there is still a very backwards, old-fashioned mindset there. It was hard being mixed race as well, as people would say \"oh, you're so white\" or \"you act so white\". What does \"acting white\" mean? I'm acting like a person. There's no acting white or acting black. I'm a British person. When I would call it out, people would ask why I was using the race card. But it was because they were being racist. It would get to a point where I would just allow people to say these things to me and I wouldn't call it out. I would let people use certain racial slurs like the N-word. I would allow it or otherwise I wouldn't be accepted. Looking back at my younger self, I kind of wish I was stronger as a person and strong enough to stand my ground. I think because I was so scared about not being accepted and not having any friends, I just allowed it. If I was the person then that I am now, I would have not allowed myself to be treated that way. I recently joined in an anti-racism protest in London with my cousin. It was really such a lovely experience. To see that many people come together, of all races, goes to show it isn't about white fighting black. It's a fight against racism. To see the amount of respect people showed for George Floyd, and all the other people who lost their lives, was amazing. There was one point we were kneeling in complete silence. Everyone was on the same level. There was no judgement from anyone and to feel that included was so nice. This whole movement at the moment and the way people are coming forward with their own experiences, that's what made me want to speak out. I hope I can help other people to use their voice. I think education is key. It's about educating people to understand that if you see someone who looks different in a place where the majority of people are white or black, it shouldn't make a difference to what you think of this person. One thing I try and do is not get upset with the person who is being racist because they've learnt it. It's not them as a person. It can be unlearnt. It's about getting them to understand. Being mixed race, I have one side of me that's white, that I can educate. And a black side that I can empower and help become equal. I'm aware I have two races I can help. As told to Hayley Westcott"

        "text": "Making headlines is never something that has motivated Kathy Sullivan. Already in the history books as the first US woman to complete a spacewalk in 1984, the 68-year-old found herself in the news again this week after becoming the first woman to travel almost seven miles (11km) to reach the lowest known point in the ocean. The two missions, total opposites in the minds of some, represent two extremes of a lifelong passion for Dr Sullivan: to understand the world around her as much as possible. \"I was always a pretty adventurous and curious child with interests wider and more varied than the stereotype of a little girl,\" Sullivan told the BBC in a phone interview from the Pacific Ocean. She was born in New Jersey in 1951 and spent her childhood in California. Her father was an aerospace engineer who, along with her mother, would always encourage their two children to think freely and join in with discussions. \"They really fed our curiosity on anything we were curious about or interested in,\" she says. \"They were our best allies to explore that interest further and see where it might take us: it might die out in a couple of days, it might be something that became our best hobby or it might turn into the central focus of our career.\" By the time they were five or six, it was already clear her brother wanted to grow up to fly aeroplanes. Sullivan, meanwhile, became fascinated by maps and learning more about the interesting places on them. \"Both of our careers have basically been remarkably wonderful fulfilments of those early dreams,\" she reflects. As a little girl, Sullivan was already devouring every newspaper, magazine and television report she could find on the subject of exploration. It was a time when Jacques Cousteau was making pioneering undersea discoveries and the Mercury Seven were propelling the image of astronauts into America's mind. \"I saw these people - they happened to all be men, that didn't bother me... I saw there are people in the world that have continually inquisitive, adventurous lives: they're going to places no-one's been and they have this store of knowledge and they're learning more.\" \"My way of thinking about it never crystallised into: I want that job, I want that title or that label,\" she explains about her ambitions as a teenager. \"But what I knew really clearly was what I wanted my life to be like, I wanted it to have that mixture of inquiry and adventure and competency.\" Her pursuit first took her into foreign languages and then, as an undergraduate, into the study of earth sciences. Back then, around 1970, it was an area still overwhelmingly male-dominated. \"The guys went out to field camps and they dressed all grubby and they never showered and they could swear and be real, rowdy little boys again to their hearts' content,\" she says. Her presence was treated like a disturbance to their fun. Sullivan felt that by this time, there was already some change under way. She was never, for instance, harassed or bullied for her gender. \"In fact, in a couple of key instances, I had some tremendously supportive male professors and colleagues that were definitely, definitely on my side and just saw me as a very capable fellow student, very capable geologist, very capable fellow shipmate.\" Sullivan saw in her marine science professors her ambitions for her own life realised - and so began to further her studies in oceanography. She applied to Nasa as a way to deepen her knowledge of the earth further still. \"My primary motivation for applying to be an astronaut was - if I somehow beat the odds and actually got chosen - I could get to see the earth from orbit with my own eyes.\" Sullivan was admitted into Nasa's class of 1978. It was the first recruitment drive that brought women into its astronaut ranks. Six were selected from the class of 35 and Sally Ride, seen on the far left of the image above, became the first of them to fly into space in 1983. Ride would later recount the unique challenges of being the first women recruited into the space program. Engineers tried to design special make-up kits and wildly overestimated how many tampons would be needed for week-long missions. Sullivan's first mission, STS-41-G, set off on 5 October 1984. It was the 13th flight of Nasa's Space shuttle program and the sixth trip for the Space Shuttle Challenger. On 11 October 1984 Sullivan made history when she became the first American woman to leave a spacecraft, along with fellow mission specialist David Leestma, on a spacewalk to demonstrate the feasibility of an orbital refuelling system. She went on to take part in two more missions, including the 1990 launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. She logged 532 hours in space in total and was inducted into the Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2004. \"My spacewalk was three and a half hours long. It's a spacewalk that counts but that's actually very short as spacewalks go,\" Sullivan says. \"I was just delighted to see women come after me and do, you know, much more elaborate, much more complicated, much more demanding spacewalks.\" Over the years, Sullivan has also been buoyed to see women increasingly involved at senior levels throughout the space program - including in commanding roles and managing missions from the ground. \"These are all wonderful things and I think help show young girls that you can make your way to these places,\" she says. \"No one's promising you a primrose path. You know, you're gonna have your setbacks, you're gonna have to persist and persevere. \"You're going to have to fight back sometimes. But the door is at least ajar - it's not wide open, but you can make your way through it.\" Last year an all-female spacewalk eventually happened for the first time. It was a nice little \"bookend\" moment for Sullivan, especially given Christina Koch wore the same life support system backpack Sullivan had all the way back in 1984. Upon leaving Nasa in 1993, Sullivan went on to serve as chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and later as its administrator under President Obama. Between those positions she spent years as president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry (COSI) and in a distinguished position at Ohio State University. The surprise invitation for her latest adventure came from Victor Vescovo, a former naval officer and investor who has spent years and millions of dollars on technology to take people underwater, to the depths of our planet. The Challenger Deep is the deepest known part of the earth's seabed. Part of the Mariana Trench, it is almost seven miles (11km) below the ocean's surface, 200 miles southwest of Guam in the Pacific Ocean. It was first reached in 1960 by two men - US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard - and has only been reached a handful of times since, including by Titanic director James Cameron. Vescovo, a keen explorer himself, has said the primary motivation for his private endeavour is to spur interest in the sea and science. Last year he became the first person to visit the deepest points in every ocean using his two-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor, launched from dedicated support ships. Sullivan said he contacted her via email to invite her on his latest mission, because he thought it was \"really time\" for a woman to get down there. She suspects it was her friendship with Don Walsh, the oceanographer first to reach the Challenger Deep, that earned her the recommendation. After researching Vescovo's endeavour, she excitedly agreed. Last Sunday she accompanied him down more than 35,800ft (10,900m) inside the two-person submersible - becoming only the eighth person and first woman to reach the bottom. She describes the journey as like being inside a magic sphere. Seeing the lander - an unmanned robotic vehicle that descends to the seafloor - alongside them at such depth was like stumbling upon \"an alien space probe\", she says. \"I mean, it's just magical that we can go to these places because of the ingenuity and the engineering prowess of these teams of people, we can take our bodies to places that we really have no business being. \"And we can do that, essentially, in street clothes. I mean, I ate lunch 31,000ft below the surface of the ocean on Sunday. That's crazy.\" 5 facts about this week's Challenger Deep dive with @CaladanOceanic and @EYOSExpeditions 1.

In a press release for the dive, the organisers drew the comparison between Vescovo's enterprise and what is being done with SpaceX - saying they both show the \"exciting potential\" of private companies contributing to technological advancement worldwide. Sullivan believes that as nations and individuals we should continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge about the world we live in. She also expresses her hope for improved diversity and female representation across the world of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem). \"The stereotype is a very dull person in a lab coat that just knows numbers and just knows principles,\" she says. \"But in so many fields where science and technology are at the core of what you're doing, it's completely creative.\" So does she have any plans for her next adventure? \"I think exploration can take many forms - it doesn't have to be venturing off physically to the middle of the Pacific Ocean or to the earth orbit,\" she says. \"There are topics, there are subjects, that there are lots of dimensions to exploring. \"I think I will be exploring until they put me in a little wooden box at some point in the future.\""

        "text": "Scenes of streets in lockdown, health officials wearing PPE, dangerously contaminated surfaces and a battle with an invisible enemy are set to feature in a new TV drama from Sunday. But the events depicted in BBC One's The Salisbury Poisonings took place two years before the coronavirus pandemic began. The three-part series is based on the events of March 2018, when the Wiltshire cathedral city faced one of the biggest threats to UK public health in recent years. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found slumped and foaming at the mouth on a city centre bench, having been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent Novichok. The government would later conclude it was an assassination attempt by two agents of Russian intelligence service the GRU. It's an extraordinary story, which Salisbury is still recovering from. But the dramatisation isn't some kind of James Bond-style spy thriller. The Skripals are only seen briefly at the beginning of the first episode, and the Russian suspects are not shown at all. Instead, it focuses on the response of the local community and health officials. \"We were drawn to the stories of the people who had to clean up this mess, rather than the people who made it,\" says Declan Lawn, who co-wrote the script with Adam Patterson. \"It's about ordinary people who have to pick up the pieces. We thought that's where the drama was, where the emotion was. We didn't want to do the obvious thing, which would have probably been an espionage drama. \"But I hope that what we've done is show that there are people out there who take a bullet for us, they are a hidden network of people who keep this society together.\" At the centre of the The Salisbury Poisonings is Tracy Daszkiewicz (played by Anne-Marie Duff), the director of public health for Wiltshire. She had been appointed just three months before the Skripals were poisoned, but had worked for Wiltshire Council for more than a decade. In reality, Daszkiewicz played an integral role of the response to the poisoning, but avoided media exposure - in part to not betray the trust of local residents. Together with the police, she used CCTV to work meticulously to find out who the Skripals might have come into contact with on the day they were poisoned, and took a cautious approach to protecting the public. \"To us now, it seems perfectly logical,\" says Duff, referring to how common certain health measures have become since coronavirus. \"Of course we close our doors and windows and wear masks, but at the time, it seemed like she was being thoroughly extreme and overreacting. \"But what's glorious about Tracy is her background. Her background is in social work, she's very grassroots, she comes at things from a tactile level. So she'll ask, 'What do we know to be true? What do we know if someone has food poisoning? What if the water source becomes contaminated?'\" Both Skripals survived the attack, as did Det Sgt Nick Bailey, a police officer who was one of the first to respond to the attack. But a local woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after coming into contact with the substance several weeks after the initial attack. On 30 June, Ms Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley became unwell at a house in Amesbury, eight miles from Salisbury, after spraying a bottle of perfume containing Novichok on her wrists. The perfume had been given to her as a gift from Rowley, who had found it in a charity shop bin. He said it had been disguised as a well-known perfume brand and was in sealed packaging. Actress MyAnna Buring, who plays Ms Sturgess, says the portrayal of her in the Salisbury Poisonings may surprise those who remember media coverage of her death in 2018. \"A lot of us remember a lot of news outlets describing her as homeless and a drug addict, and in doing so sort of dismissed her death as inevitable because of her life choices,\" Buring recalls. \"And that simply was not true. She was not homeless, she was not a drug addict, she was a woman who had experienced mental health issues, and knocks in life, which I think all of us can relate to. She did struggle with alcohol but she was working really hard to turn her life around. She had a loving family, partner, friends.\" It can often take a long time for a TV drama or film to be made about a real life event, but The Salisbury Poisonings has been turned around relatively quickly. Indeed, the series was only completed in the last few months. Director Saul Dibb explains: \"We filmed our last sequence the week before lockdown [on 23 March], and after that we finished it remotely. It just had this creeping sense of resonance as coronavirus took over us.\" The drama was filmed mainly in Newport, south Wales, plus Bristol and other parts of the south-west, rather than in Salisbury itself. Duff has said producers were \"very sensitive\" about where to recreate certain events. Nonetheless, there has been some criticism of the drama, including from DS Bailey's parents, who said in a letter to a local newspaper last year that the series was \"inappropriately premature\". DS Bailey himself, however, did not object, and has met the actor who plays him, Rafe Spall. Like ITV's recent drama Quiz, the BBC has decided to broadcast the three episodes on consecutive nights, rather than risk losing momentum (and audience interest) by making them weekly. As a drama it \"works as a narrative on a number of different levels\", says Dibb. \"It's partly a domestic drama, partly a thriller, and partly a very prescient virus horror, of this invisible enemy that can kill lots of people. \"So it was about finding ways to harness all of those things to be able to tell a story which I think all of us felt had the potential to be more than a straightforward docu-drama. \"And it's extraordinarily surreal, this weird thing happening in the middle of this small British cathedral city, that even if you were directly poisoned or not, everybody - it seemed to me - became contaminated by this poison.\" The Salisbury Poisonings starts on BBC One at 21:00 BST on Sunday 14 June."

        "text": "Every morning Michael Ermogenis leaves his house in Oia, Santorini, to walk his dog. The picturesque island's famous domed churches and sunset views helped draw more than two million overnight visitors last year. For months he has been able to wander the marble paths all day and barely see another person, as the coronavirus pandemic has stopped tourism. But on Monday that is all set to change, as Greece reopens its borders with the aim of kick-starting its tourist season. Usually the crowds and traffic on Santorini are so hectic that it can take Michael up to an hour to leave his village. Tourist numbers had been growing so much that the EU warned they were putting \"the future of the destination at risk\". \"It's just unbelievable,\" he says. \"I feel like I've been given the keys to Disneyland. But at the same time, I know this hasn't been done for my benefit. It's a major global disaster.\" The halt to global travel has proved devastating to a Mediterranean country such as Greece, where tourism makes up as much as 30% of economic output and commands up to one in five jobs. It welcomed a record 33 million visitors last year, and for many islands tourism is the main source of private sector employment. Millions of nights in tourist accommodation Some island residents are now wondering if this could be an opportunity to move to a more sustainable tourism model. \"Right now, over-tourism as a subject has come off the boil,\" says Michael Ermogenis. He was previously so worried about visitor numbers that he started a Save Oia campaign, erecting signs around the village asking tourists to treat their surroundings with respect. \"The question is, how soon will it become an issue again, unless the authorities try do things in a more thoughtful, strategic way?\" Greece begins phase two, allowing international flights into Thessaloniki airport; until now only Athens was open. Flights resume from much of Europe, Israel, Japan, Australia and New Zealand: 1 July: International arrivals allowed into all Greek airports and sea ports, with random testing. On the nearby island of Mykonos, famous for its parties and celebrity visitors, Stacey Harris-Papaioannou admits she has been enjoying having the beaches largely to herself. \"But nice as it is, we can't pay our bills with sand,\" she laughs, explaining that she makes an income renting accommodation to seasonal workers. Cruise ships have been one of the islanders' biggest complaints, she says. \"On any given day we might have seven of them show up at once, and the island gets deluged with an extra 20,000 people within an hour,\" she says. For years, she and others have been calling for boat arrivals to be staggered. The pandemic has put paid to the cruise industry for now and this year none of the big ships will be docking in the harbour. Many Mykonians are happy about this, although some businesses such as cafes and mini-markets will take a hit. Another problem has been the pressure on infrastructure, as capacity has not increased to keep up with visitor numbers. Mykonos frequently experiences blackouts due to excessive energy use. Waste management too is a huge issue. Santorini has no recycling facilities, just an illegal dumpsite not up to EU standards. Tourism has been used by successive Greek governments as a means of resuscitating the country after crises. In the 1950s, the government built five-star, state-run hotels in a bid to attract upmarket visitors after World War Two. After the military dictatorship took power in a coup in 1967, the focus turned to mass tourism, and continued after it fell in 1974. Tourism has helped Greece recover from the 2008 financial crisis, too, although many argue it has not been properly managed. \"There is still a lack of specific policies regarding tourism flows,\" says Prof Efthymia Sarantakou at the University of West Attica. \"One basic weakness is that the government structure does not give regional authorities the power to manage and regulate tourism at a local level.\" Another complaint in Greece is that over-reliance on tourism has led to a deluge of low-skilled, badly paid seasonal jobs. \"It's an industry that employs a lot of women, migrants and young people worldwide,\" says Kristina Zampoukos, from the department of tourism studies at Mid Sweden University. \"It's a sector that's not highly valued or paid because of its association with feminised skills, such as cleaning, serving and caring for others.\" Other destinations that have previously suffered from over-tourism, such as Venice and Amsterdam, have already declared they are using the pandemic as an opportunity to introduce more sustainable models. So far the Greek government has not made any similar moves. For the moment many islanders are focused on whether they can make an income and avoid a second wave of the virus. But they will be wary of seeing the old problems return."

        "text": "My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make. Here Laura Tarver from Oxford takes us through a week in her life during the coronavirus pandemic. Laura is 35 and lives in Abingdon, just outside Oxford with her husband, two-year-old daughter and cat. She works part-time as a speech and language therapist both for the NHS and privately. Her husband Tim is a doctor. In her spare, toddler-free time, Laura enjoys running, and during lockdown has taken up learning the ukulele online. Over to Laura.... I am woken at six by my little girl Izzy shouting from next door. Today I am working from home, while she goes to the childminder. Our time during lockdown has been quite varied. At the start, I tried to juggle my two-and-a-half days of work around childcare, being very thankful that I didn't work full-time. I then had a very brief stint being redeployed as a home carer within the NHS, and now that things are starting to get back to normal, I am starting to work as a speech and language therapist again, thankfully while Izzy continues to go to the childminder. Today, the childminder fees for June come out - \u00a3563 for the month (although the government pays 20% of this as part of the tax-free childcare scheme). As all of my work is usually schools based, it is not known yet how long we will have to work from home for - we are starting to try to carry out more therapy online, but this is tricky with many of the children I work with. As a very small plus side, working from home is saving me money and time on commuting, which is often an hour each way in Oxford traffic. I spend \u00a333 on filling up the car today, which I have to do significantly less often than pre-lockdown. Total spend: \u00a3596 Today, during my lunch break, I pop out to pick up some clothes and a toy trolley for Izzy, which I found advertised on a Hand me on Baby and Toddler site I follow on Facebook. These sites have saved me a fortune over the last few years, as well as avoiding buying new when not needed. Generally, I like to get as much as possible from places such as this, charity shops or second-hand sales, although with those not being available over the past couple of months, I have had to get a few bits like toddler sandals and shorts during my weekly shop. Our fortnightly cleaner also starts back today, hurrah! Although a bit of a luxury, I feel that this \u00a320 a fortnight is more than justified by the number of arguments it saves in our marriage! In the evening I take part in an online ukulele course, shown on Facebook. In non-Covid times, these take place in a pub in Oxford. Although lockdown has obviously limited our opportunities to go out, I was never able to make this class in person due to Izzy's bedtime, so having the chance to do it online now is a plus! The class organiser has kindly made the class fee voluntary (\u00a36) for those who are on limited finances at this time. Total spend: \u00a326 Lots of bills go out today, making me feel considerably poorer! Our mortgage is \u00a31,000 a month, while a combination of various insurances (cars, house, pet), mobile phone, council tax and a couple of charity and professional subscriptions comes to \u00a3314. We try to review these fairly regularly, to check that other subscriptions haven't sneaked in that we are no longer using, but they do seem hard to pare down. I pop to the supermarket to get a few bits we are missing, and somehow end up spending \u00a318. This includes a big bag of compost - like half the country, I've got into gardening during lockdown. Because I don't have a clue what I'm doing, anything that doesn't die feels like a bonus - and I can't wait to see if we get anything edible out of it in a couple of months time. I also treat myself to a takeaway chocolate milkshake from a local cafe (\u00a33). This is the first time I've had the chance to do something like this in weeks, and feels like heaven! Later on, I buy an e-book for a bargain \u00a32. I usually tend to try to get books out from the library, or from the charity shop, but again with those options out of action at the moment, I have been getting a few online. Total spend: \u00a31,337 Today me and Izzy head to the supermarket for our main food shop of the week. This comes to \u00a363, which is a bit less than usual. Although most of our spending has gone down during lockdown, our supermarket spends have definitely gone up - probably due to less eating out, and feeling like we deserve some \"treats\" at home! In the afternoon, I take Izzy for a bike ride near our house, on her balance bike. Lockdown has meant I've got much better at finding these close by, free activities, whereas before it was always easiest to sign up to classes like music or gym classes for easy entertainment. It's nice to have time to play at home a bit more and not be so tied into a schedule, as well as saving some cash! In the evening I carry out some private speech therapy online. Pre-lockdown, I saw four or five children privately every week. This has now decreased to only two, who I see online. I haven't yet got my head around how to provide therapy online effectively for everyone I see, but need to start thinking about that if the situation is unlikely to change for a while. For the moment though, this does mean we are around \u00a3200-\u00a3300 a month worse off. Total spend: \u00a363 Today we have a lovely walk with a friend, her toddler and two-month-old - the first time I've met the little one! While it's great to be allowed to meet up again, I am missing our usual options of a cup of tea in someone's house or a cafe, especially given the looming rainclouds. Still, it's another free outing. We also treat ourselves to our weekly lockdown takeaway, this week Lebanese. This has been a little treat to ourselves since the option was taken away of going out for dinner, to pubs, cafes etc, although ironically we used to manage this much less than once a week. It's also the time in the week that me and Tim make to sit down and have a proper conversation, which can often get missed with work and toddler bedtimes. We are making our way through all the local places still offering takeaway food in our town - all to support the local economy of course! Today's was \u00a340, quite steep, but gives us enough food for tomorrow lunchtime too. Total spend: \u00a340 More blogs from the BBC's My Money Series: Today me, Tim and Izzy meet up with some different friends to help them walk their dog. Our child entertainment options have changed a lot since lockdown. Previously we would have relied a lot more on paid activities, such as soft play, farm parks and cafes. Now, we tend to have a walk or a cycle ride, with a packed snack for Izzy. It's enlightening to see that she gets just as excited by these smaller, cheaper trips as the previous bigger ones, although she does keep asking for different activities she is going to do \"when virus gone\". Although we have definitely saved money on our weekend trips out, we did compensate for being at home so much with a 10ft trampoline! Unfortunately the good weather has turned, so we hide out at home in the afternoon with a film. We also have to jumpstart the car. (Note, don't let your toddler play at \"driving\" without checking the lights are switched off at the end!) I clearly don't learn from my mistakes as the same thing happened a few weeks ago with the other car! Luckily this time we don't have to end up shelling out for a whole new battery... Total spend: \u00a30 Another day, another walk with friends. This time we go to a local farm park, which has opened up a few walks past the animals, and (woop woop) the cafe! So we spend \u00a32 on parking and \u00a35.50 on ice creams for us all. It's been lovely this week catching up with friends we haven't seen for so long. This afternoon, despite having time to cook, we were all feeling super lazy, so we got Domino's Pizza (\u00a320), which made me feel a bit guilty from both a health and money perspective, but as always we promised ourselves that next week would be better\u2026 Total spend: \u00a327.50 As it was \"bill week\", this obviously made it much steeper than other weeks in the month. Taking out the bills and childcare costs, we spent \u00a3209 on other things, which is more than I was expecting before adding it all up. It was a slightly decadent week, with two takeaways, but apart from that I don't think there were any other big luxuries. Although the amount we spend on food has gone up since lockdown, I think spending has gone down on other things such as trips out and shopping for non-essentials, so I don't think we are doing too badly. We're looking for more people to share what they spend their money on. If you're interested, please email my.money@bbc.co.uk or get in touch via our My Money (World) Facebook group, or if you live in the UK, please join our My Money (UK) Facebook group and we'll aim to contact you."

        "text": "In the small Yorkshire village of Emmerdale, they're limiting things to two characters at a time. Residents on Albert Square in London's East End are about to go quiet but they'll be back. On a cobbled street in Weatherfield in Greater Manchester, life is going back to normal. However, there's no kissing and older people are only seen on Zoom. In Summer Bay, north of Sydney, they actually are kissing but only at a distance. If you've not worked out what's going on here, this might not be the article for you. Australian soap Home and Away has just finished its third week of filming after a nine week halt because of coronavirus. Stars and writers say they're already learning lots about their new way of working which could help the UK productions which are just getting back to work. For Georgie Parker, who plays Roo Stewart, it's been a learning curve. \"I had to kiss someone!\" \"I shared a kiss with someone and it wasn't my father.\" Quick fact check if you've not seen Home And Away for ages: Roo Stewart is Alf Stewart's daughter. Yep. Alf is still in it. In fact, he's just remarried Roo's mum who faked her own death 30 years ago. It feels like a pandemic might be the least of Alf's worries. Georgie goes on: \"That was tricky and we had to do some old school tricks. We couldn't get anywhere near each other so it was pretty funny.\" Lucy Addario, the series producer, adds: \"When we stopped, it was such an unknown, we hoped we wouldn't be down for a long time.\" There are basic changes for actors and crew at the Sydney studios including temperature checks when they arrive, health and safety officers on set and make-up artists wearing face masks and gloves. The stars can do their own hair and make-up if they prefer. Georgie says getting ready to go on set is working well: \"You walk in and it smells like you're going into a hospital. Everything is sterilised, everything is bleached and everything is cleaned. \"It's pretty quick and efficient now. This is how we're used to doing it.\" Australia's Channel 7 films Home And Away months in advance - with broadcasts on Channel 5 in the UK a few weeks behind what Aussie viewers see. It means it'll be a while before we get to see their new way of working - and even longer before we see the famous beach again. \"To be honest we actually haven't been back to Palm Beach yet, there's still some restrictions on the amount of people in public places,\" explains Lucy. \"I guess being outdoors helps, I guess it's more natural to spread out.\" Social distancing and location changes have meant some hastily re-written storylines too but Lucy thinks that actually made things better. \"When we stopped we were in the middle of awesome stories. We just wanted to be true to them and tell them still, but we just had to look at how we can tell them differently. \"There was one which we rewrote and I thought afterwards that it's so much better. \"It's to do with two of our young couples. We had to change the destination, The way the writers adapted it I thought 'wow' and it was so much better. I had more of an emotional reaction to it.\" In the UK, the episodes of Eastenders filmed before lockdown will end next week (Tuesday) and aren't expected to return before the end of July. They'll be replaced with spin-off shows and classic editions. Emmerdale is broadcasting a series of weekly specials until regular filming is ready to be shown. Each episode features just two characters. Coronation Street actors got back to work this week. ITV has been showing three episodes a week since March. It usually broadcasts six. One thing Home And Away fans won't be getting though - coronavirus storylines. Lucy says: \"We did think about it but we really know that people love to come to Summer Bay to escape. \"By the time the episodes we shoot get shown, if we are doing covid stories, it'll be the last thing people want.\" Georgie adds: \"Who wants to see covid on a beach?\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

        "text": "Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble. When Boris Johnson announced the new rules allowing single people who live alone in England the option of creating a bubble with one other household from this weekend, he created a real dilemma for some - who to share a bubble with? I'm in the category that is permitted to make that choice as I live alone. Single parents with children under 18 are also given the option of \"bubbling up\" with someone else. The new rule allows unlimited visits, and even overnight stays, between the two homes without the need for social distancing. But if anybody in the bubble gets coronavirus symptoms, everyone in those households will be forced into self-isolation for 14 days - even if they had limited themselves to brief bubble visits rather than staying over. Once you make your choice you have to stick with it. You cannot bounce from one bubble to another. Some families are facing yet more heart-breaking decisions. But as a single man without children, I can be more relaxed about choosing my bubble - so what are my options? I'm part of a close Irish family and the chance of my first proper visit in months to my parents' home in time for Father's Day is the choice that truly warms my heart. But they also have a lovely garden so I'm already able to go and spend time with them (on any day that the weather holds). And given they are both in their 70s and I am a key worker going to and from work each day, I feel that I might continue to exercise the greatest caution and stick to those outdoor gatherings. Sorry mum. Now I must admit I did feel a lump in my throat when a colleague's words prompted me to conclude that, due to living alone and the strict social distancing guidelines, I'd not had a hug since mid-March. Nor a pat on the back, a kiss on the cheek or any other form of direct human contact. My best friend gives the warmest hugs, the soundest life advice and, as she also lives alone, it seems like a beautiful bubble option. But... As Jane Austen so nearly said, it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of his own home must be in want of a person to share his bubble. The government is quick to stress that people who happen to be single but live in a shared house (eg with flatmates) will not get the opportunity to mingle - unless they have a partner who happens to live alone. So I am in a privileged position. If the dream woman was to walk into my life this summer, surely it is a better prospect to our chances of romance if I can invite her for dinner a deux. Explaining that I am already in a bubble with my parents would NOT be a good look. I've seen the damage being done to certain people close to me after they handed over their hair maintenance to those they live with. But I have been so impressed by the newly-discovered skills of some others who have clearly found their inner Lee Stafford. With barbers and hairdressers still firmly closed, is it a vanity overload to base your bubble choice on who can best tend to your tresses? To be honest, the thing that I've missed the most over the past three months is my football fix - but televised matches are back with a vengeance from next week. Every Premier League match is to be televised live. I'm a Liverpool fan desperate to see every moment of my club's bid to end 30 years (and two unexpected extra months) of hurt and seal a Premier League title. But I suspect many of the key matches will be claimed by Sky Sports and BT Sport - and I only have a subscription to the first of those. All I need is to choose a mate with BT Sport for our own transfer deal and a superb summer lies ahead. Dreaming of beers on the couch as we watch up to four live matches a day makes me nostalgic for the days when Frank Skinner and David Baddiel shared the same set-up in real-life as well as in the TV studio. Or the supersized version of the above option. My favourite bar is managed by a friend on a live-in basis - and from what I can tell, she and her boyfriend have the run of the place right now. Is it too cheeky to propose a bubble link-up so I can pop in and legally enjoy their big-screen football, pool table and jukebox? I pledge to do no more than stare longingly at the beer taps as we patiently wait for the day all pubs can reopen. Those who like to cook love to have people to cook for. I'm lucky enough to have a really talented chef among my friends but just having anyone who loves food to share a dinner table with after so many months of living alone is such an attractive choice. And, yes, if you do the cooking, I can bring dessert. After so many weeks of life alone at home, I'm genuinely undecided - and I suspect so are many other single people (at least those who don't have a pressing family issue to consider). And of course, you can only make any of these arrangements if someone agrees for you to join them - and no firm invitations have arrived so far. Let's just hope my bubble dreams don't burst... *Illustrations by Sana Jasemi Have you created a support bubble as you live alone or are a single parent?

        "text": "A review into the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule has been commissioned by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He faces increasing pressure from his own MPs and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together, to help businesses after they reopen. However, the government's scientific advisers say that being 1m (just over 3ft) apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m. Some countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks. Others, including the UK, have gone further: In a study published in medical journal The Lancet, scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads. They concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Proximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes. But some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If true, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Prof Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out in Chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But the US Centers for Disease Control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is \"currently uncertain\". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. A crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection. The direction of air flow is also crucial - whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you. And a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference. In a restaurant in China, where nine people caught the virus, the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside. Scientists advising the British government say every workplace or building should assess the risks. And they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible, people should only be closer for short periods of time. Plastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time. Arranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help. And in a growing number of many countries, including all parts of the UK, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and \"enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible\". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged, and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But we still don't know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease. Until that is established, the advice is that the risks are real - and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed."

        "text": "Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line with new World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering from Monday - to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The new rules coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class of some secondary school pupils and the reopening of non-essential shops. The number of people using public transport is expected to increase. The government stresses people should: Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules including: If it is \"reasonably necessary\" for you to eat or drink you can remove the face covering to do so. The rules will apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry will ask people to cover their face as they enter a station. People could be refused travel if they don't follow the rules. They could also be fined, but this will be the last resort. Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory. Similar advice has been given by Northern Ireland's first minister and deputy first minister. In Scotland, it is recommended you consider using face coverings in limited circumstances - such as public transport - as a precautionary measure. The government has been careful to use the term \"face covering\" rather than \"face mask\". Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear \"the kind of face covering you can easily make at home\" - with surgical masks kept for medical use. Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings. The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings from Monday - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary. NHS England has now lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts. Health staff already wear masks in clinical areas within 2m (6ft) of a patient - but they will now have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments. It says they could provide \"a barrier for potentially infectious droplets\" in areas where \"physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible\". The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments. The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them. Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease. There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice."

        "text": "England's lockdown restrictions are easing, with changes aimed at reducing loneliness among people who live alone. Each of the four UK nations has different rules. So what can you do now? From Saturday 13 June, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents with children under 18 - can form an \"exclusive\" support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size - but nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They will not have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can stay overnight. It means, for example, that a single grandparent could pair up with one of their children's households. An adult living alone could mix with their parents, or two single friends living apart could get together. If anyone in the bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in both households must self-isolate. If you don't live on your own, or with children under 18 only, then the rules haven't changed for you. In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a recommended maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. In all countries, children are included in the headcount and social distancing guidelines - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - apply. People in England can exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside. So having a kickabout with a football in the park is allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, with social distancing, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: \"It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet.\" Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. In Wales, you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an excuse for garden parties. People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible. Another group, of about 2.5 million people, is categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called \"shielding\". Now those people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again - either with members of their household, or by meeting someone else at a social distance. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. Virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should self-isolate - stay at home and not leave it for any reason. Ask others to drop off food and medicines. If England's NHS Test and Trace team contact you because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

        "text": "Almost nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government. The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies. Firms have to start paying towards the scheme from August, and it will close entirely in October. So, if you've been put on furlough, what are your rights? The Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme puts workers on leave but allows them to stay on their company's payroll. Originally, furloughed employees couldn't do any work for their employer, but from 1 July they can go back to work part-time. For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Those workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of \u00a32,500 a month. Yes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, or when it ends. If they are entitled to redundancy pay it would be calculated based on the amount they earned before furlough. Firms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service. At present, furloughed staff can't do any work for their employer. From July, they can be brought back to work on a part-time basis, In the meantime, they can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to \u00a32,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. The take-up has been significant, with about 8.9 million workers furloughed since March. Employers had made about \u00a319.6bn of furlough claims by 7 June, and the scheme will cost the government an estimated \u00a380bn in total. The scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. Workers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. Companies can top up this pay and must let employees know they have been furloughed. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at \u00a32,500 per employee per month before tax, or \u00a3576.92 a week. If employees' pay varies each month, you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than \u00a350,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is offered as a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of \u00a37,500. Applications for a second grant will open in August. Anyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage."

        "text": "Non-essential shops can reopen in England from Monday, as lockdown restrictions are eased. Similar retailers were allowed to reopen in Northern Ireland on Friday. So, what can customers expect? All shops in England selling what are called \"non-essential\" goods will be able to open. This includes retailers offering clothes, toys, books and electronics - as well as record shops, tailors, auction houses, photography studios and indoor markets. The government says they must meet Covid-19 guidelines to keep shoppers and workers safe. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations were able to remain open during lockdown. Garden centres reopened in England in mid-May, followed by open-air markets and car showrooms on 1 June. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas won't be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meet social distancing measures. A number of big retailers have announced plans: Some other retailers selling products classed as essential - such as DIY, furniture and bicycles - have also been reopening. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. In Northern Ireland, all shops are now allowed to open. In Scotland, smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in phase two of its lockdown-easing plan. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says it's likely there will be more details on Thursday. Wales's Economy Minister Ken Skates says he would like to see non-essential shops reopen the week of 22 June if coronavirus cases continue to fall. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) apart have already become a regular fixture in supermarkets. You are likely to see them in other shops too. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas to not touch items unless you intend to buy - will be in place to try to reduce the virus spread. John Lewis will clean baskets after each use. It will not let customers use fitting rooms, and services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services. The bra fitting service will not be available, for example. All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. It may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. The British Retail Consortium estimates that the lockdown is costing non-essential retailers \u00a31.8bn a week in lost sales. \"Many retailers will be anxious to see whether demand returns to our High Streets,\" says the BRC's chief executive, Helen Dickinson. The British Independent Retailers Association's chief executive, Andrew Goodacre, is also wary - believing fewer people than before will go shopping and they may \"soon become weary of queuing\". With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains. Clothing retailers went into lockdown just after stocking up with spring and summer ranges, which they now need to shift."

        "text": "A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. More than 200 travel companies have asked for the new rules to be scrapped and some MPs have also voiced concerns. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move would protect public health, now that imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined \u00a3100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to \u00a31,000 if they fail to self-isolate. Passengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. Once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Employers should agree future working arrangements with staff before they travel internationally. Those returning from overseas will not be eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms. Anyone arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - does not have to enter quarantine. However, you can't avoid self-isolation by heading to these places first on your way back to the UK - a loophole termed by some as the \"Dublin dodge\". Travellers from these places will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for at least 14 days. The government has also said it is looking into ''international travel corridors'' between the UK and countries with low infection rates and strong healthcare systems. It hopes this could avoid the need for quarantine for travellers between the two. Portugal's foreign minister told the BBC he hoped an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. However, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end. The measures will be reviewed in late June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''. There are a number of groups who are exempt, including: Travellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Fourteen-day quarantine rules apply in destinations including Greece, Canada, the UAE, Australia and New Zealand. Many have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. In Spain, only UK citizens with permanent resident status can enter. From 1 July, Spain will allow some travellers in without quarantining, but this doesn't include the UK. Airlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine \"would effectively kill off air travel\". The British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them \"overzealous\". Virgin Atlantic will restart a handful of routes from 20th July, with more to follow in August. EasyJet will restart a ''small number'' of flights on 15 June, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks. Ryanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports. British Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the new quarantine rules.

        "text": "In some parts of the UK, some people are being allowed to have close contact once again with people from outside their household. BBC News answers questions about who can form a \"support bubble\", and other questions about coronavirus. If you and your boyfriend both live alone and in England, the good news is that from 13 June, you can form a support bubble, which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each other\u2019s company, inside or outside a house. You don\u2019t have to keep a 2m distance from one another, and you can stay overnight at each other\u2019s house. If you are living alone, and your partner is in a shared household (or vice versa), matters get complicated. You can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household, and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household. What this means is that if one of your boyfriend\u2019s housemates has a partner who is - like you - living elsewhere and alone, that couple will be prevented from meeting up. Support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone (or alone with children). If both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households, you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other. You cannot form a support bubble with your boyfriend if he lives in Scotland or Wales, although Northern Ireland has announced that it is also introducing support bubbles from 13 June.. As a single grandparent, you will have the right to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d with your grandson and his family. Under the government\u2019s new guidance, from 13 June your grandson would be able to stay at your home, including overnight, and would not need to keep a 2m distance. However, the complicating factor here is your lodger. Are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other, and are you using separate rooms and facilities? If the answer is yes, then there should be no problem. On the other hand, if you have been using the same kitchen, living room and bathroom, and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger, then you are both effectively part of the same household, and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble. There is no current date for reopening tattoo parlours in the UK, and the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union (TPIU) says it has not received any guidance from the government on when this might happen. In the official guidance on which businesses must stay closed for the present, tattoo parlours are listed in the category of personal care, alongside hairdressers, barbers and beauty and nail salons. Under the plans for easing lockdown, 4 July is the earliest date on which personal care outlets could be allowed to reopen in England. There is no set date in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Extra hygiene measures are certain to be put in place as a condition of reopening - the TPIU says these are likely to include \u201cmasks for everyone, visors/goggles for artists and paying more attention to more thorough cleaning between customers and regularly throughout the day\u201d. Caravan parks were told to close at the end of March, along with hotels, B&Bs and other types of holiday accommodation. Although some aspects of the lockdowns, people are still not supposed to stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose. The only exception to this rule is for people for whom a static caravan is their home. The government has said it wants to get England\u2019s tourism sector running again from 4 July onwards \u201cas long as it is safe to do so\u201d but has not released any details of how this will happen. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that self-contained accommodation had a lower risk than other areas, and said, \"I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue.\" The situation is clearer in Northern Ireland, where static caravans will be open for business  from 20 July onwards. In Scotland, the tourism industry has been given a conditional date of 15 July for reopening. Caravan parks are currently set to stay closed in Wales until 26 September although the Welsh government is reviewing the situation every three weeks. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford\u2019s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home. For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many \"silent spreaders\" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that \"there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics\". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, \"perhaps a lot of cases\". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many \"silent carriers\" there may be. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don\u2019t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. If you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. \"If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,\" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. \"Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.\" It\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK\u2019s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will \"remain unprecedented\" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to \"long waiters\", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre-Covid-19 levels\u201d. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that \"infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are \"no restrictions\" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: \"Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes.\" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may \"vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe\", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. It depends on a number of factors. \"Typical\" business trips to Germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out \"essential functions\" such as healthcare. A certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case. With the introduction of quarantine restrictions at UK borders from 8 June, returning to the UK will not as straightforward. Anyone entering the UK from that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. There are a number of exemptions to this rule, including UK residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. If you\u2019re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of \u00a37,500. In August, applications will open for a \"second and final\" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of \u00a32,190 a month for another three months (\u00a36,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job \"absolutely cannot be done from home\". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can\u2019t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth \u00a395.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. The government says that this plan is still on course. At the beginning of lockdown, the government promised to provide laptops and tablets for disadvantaged children and young people, so that they would not fall behind in online learning organised by their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on the Education Select Committee that 200,000 laptops would be delivered, some at the end of May, but most of them in June. On 9 June Mr Williamson told the House of Commons that 100,000 laptops had been distributed, prioritising children who have social workers, and that the government was on schedule to distribute all the computers over the coming month. However, he faced criticism from the opposition that the roll-out was taking too long. Labour MP Meg Hillier said that it was \u201calready late for vulnerable pupils, and with no clear plan about catch-up\u201d. Separate schemes to provide vulnerable children and adults with laptops have been announced in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Although the government has changed its advice on the use of face coverings in public places, it still recommends that face masks or face coverings should not be worn in schools. It adds that face coverings should not be worn in any circumstances by those who are not able to handle them properly (for example, small children or those with special educational needs or disabilities), as they may \u201cinadvertently increase the risk of transmission\u201d. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, told the Times Educational Supplement that face coverings could also have a bad effect on the mental health of some children: \u201cIf compulsory masking is going to tip some kids into a bad space after weeks of stressful lockdown, we need to balance that risk with the potential benefits.\u201d Meanwhile, other countries have taken different approaches when reopening schools. In France, for example, face masks are compulsory for teachers and pupils aged 11 and over, but they are not worn in Denmark. There are no current plans to open schools for most pupils during the summer holidays, but the situation varies across the UK. In England, some Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children have gone back, but the government has dropped plans for all primary school pupils to return before the summer. Similarly, some Year 10 and Year 12 students in England will go back from 15 June, but the government has confirmed that secondary schools may not fully reopen until September \"at the earliest\". Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June for all age groups, but only a third of pupils will be in class at any one time. The summer term has been extended by a week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland won\u2019t be returning until after the summer holidays in August. Across the UK, some vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have been in school throughout the crisis, including during the Easter holidays, but it is not yet clear whether that provision will continue over the summer break. Playgrounds are still closed in England. The next review of lockdown easing is due towards the end of the month, so changes may be considered then. In Scotland, playgrounds are set to reopen from 18 June, when the country moves into phase two of its lockdown-easing plans. There is no date yet for reopening in Wales, while there is no detail on this in Northern Ireland\u2019s recovery plan - but decisions will be delegated to councils, as they are responsible for playgrounds. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it\u2019s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: \"We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,\" he said. \"So we are talking about really large numbers of people.\" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who\u2019s leading the Church\u2019s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you don\u2019t have to go into quarantine if you\u2019re returning to the UK from what\u2019s known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the \"Dublin dodge\") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt. The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland. The government guidance details what you\u2019ll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work you\u2019ll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you. However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands. Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. What questions do you have about coronavirus?

        "text": "On Monday, non-essential shops in England will be allowed to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed. This includes retailers offering clothes, toys, books, furniture and electronics. For many people stuck indoors for weeks, it will be a welcome change of scene. But with hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, shopping will not be like it was before 23 March. Here are five ways it will be different from next week. We've all seen the 2m markings and arrows on the floor in supermarkets showing customers how far apart they need to stay and which way to walk, and this will now be the case in other non-essential stores too. People will also be asked to keep a set distance between each other on escalators. At John Lewis, for example, shoppers will be required to stand eight steps behind each other. And only one person at a time will be allowed to use a lift at the department store, unless they are from the same household. At Primark, two people can use a lift but only if they stand on designated spots. There will be hand sanitising stations throughout shops and people will be encouraged to use hand gel when they enter a shop. Shop assistants will look different as well. At Next, employees will wear a protective visor and have the option of wearing an additional mouth and nose mask. Many retailers are also fitting plastic screens at tills. And there will be a lot more cleaning going on - of shopping baskets, door handles, counters and escalator rails. Selfridges is one of the few retailers that will allow people to try clothes on but each fitting room will be sanitised by steaming and antibacterial cleaning after each customer use. Government guidelines recommend people should shop alone where possible so hopes of hitting the stores with friends will have to wait. Some retailers, such as Primark, will allow a group of people into their shops from Monday but they must be from the same household. They will also have to follow social distancing rules once they are inside the branch. Dan Simms, co-head of the UK retail agency team at Colliers International, reckons \"the younger demographic will take advantage of the lifting of restrictions to socialise and visit retail destinations\". But that is not expected to happen immediately from Monday as at the moment six people from different households are only allowed to meet outside. And some shopping malls, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre and others owned by Intu, have removed indoor seating areas to \"support social distancing\" and \"to discourage people from gathering\". Meanwhile, stopping for a coffee with a friend or sitting down for a bite to eat will be limited because some stores will not reopen their in-house cafes or restaurants. The British Retail Consortium's guidance is that customers should be discouraged from handling products that they're not going to buy. But the policy very much varies from retailer to retailer. At Selfridges, shoppers can try on shoes and the footwear will be sanitised afterwards. Kurt Geiger will also allow people to try on shoes - provided they use anti-bacterial hand gel first as well as a pop sock - but then the footwear will be placed in quarantine for 12 hours. But at H&M, people will not be allowed to try on footwear at all. It is the same for clothing. At Next, for example, customers can handle clothes but at Selfridges, shoppers will be asked not to touch items unless they intend to buy them. If they do, the garment will be quarantined for 72 hours. This is based on government guidance that the risk of infection from coronavirus on a surface is likely to be \"reduced significantly\" after a three-day period. The majority of retailers will close their changing rooms and goods returned will be quarantined for 72 hours. Some shops will also offer contactless returns. At Primark, customers will present the item they want to return to a staff member at a till, complete with their receipt which will be scanned. People will receive their refund and take their item to a returns section where it will be held for 72 hours before going back on the shop floor. At Waterstone's, that three-day rule will also apply to books that customers browse through in store, which will allow them to \"self-heal\", according to chief executive James Daunt. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people will not be allowed to handle makeup or sniff a perfume bottle. But picking things up in a shop might be a hard habit to break for some, says consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale. \"There will be this almost automatic behaviour of your muscles where you want to touch something,\" she says. \"But then you're in the middle of the flow of your hand to the counter [and] you will remind yourself, 'No, I can't.'\" And this can create other problems. Conventional wisdom suggests everyone will be delighted to get out of the house and treat themselves to a day's shopping from Monday. Not quite, says Ms Nightingale. Restrictions in shops, such as not touching items or being told which direction to walk in is likely to frustrate people already experiencing anxiety since lockdown was enforced on 23 March. \"We are basically living in a constant state of fear and anxiety - don't leave the house, don't touch anyone, don't do exactly what you were doing before - this is not a normal way of human behaviour,\" says Ms Nightingale. That means people will be going back to shops after more than three months \"with a pre-existing huge ball of negativity in our head, whether we want it or not\". Even the smallest things can cause grumpiness. At HMV, which has already reopened stores in Canada and the US, shoppers are asked to sanitise their hands before handling any merchandise. \"There are confrontations in stores about it,\" Doug Putman, the owner of HMV, told the BBC. \"For some customers, they are very comfortable, for [others], they are a little less comfortable. And I think it just comes down to your personality type.\" On the whole, though, he expects people will do their bit. \"What you've got is an overall public sentiment that even if you don't believe that you should have to sanitise and this and that, you're going to do it because it is the right thing.\" Much like supermarkets, retailers will ask shoppers to queue to prevent overcrowding in stores and allow people to maintain 2m social distancing. To relieve the tedium, some department store Selfridges will employ DJs to help make it a more \"joyful experience\". It may also take longer to pay for your shopping as some retailers will close every other cashier to prevent people being in close proximity to each other. People may also have to wait for their favourite shop to even open in the first place. While retailers like Primark will open 153 stores in England on Monday, John Lewis is initially only reopening two sites, at Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames. It intends to reopen 11 more stores the following week. Stores are being chosen on the proviso they are easily accessible by car, \"therefore reducing the reliance on public transport for partners and customers\"."

        "text": "As lockdown restrictions are eased further, people in England and Northern Ireland can now set up support bubbles. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. From Saturday, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size. Nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. The independent advisory group Sage has been asked to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubbles. The idea was introduced in New Zealand and is being considered by the Scottish government. Support bubbles must be \"exclusive\". Once in one, you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They won't have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can even stay overnight. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. There is no limit on how far you can travel in England for your support bubble but local is best, the government says. You can't bubble with anyone in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, if you are single and live alone in Northern Ireland you can bubble with another household. Social and family groups are complicated and might not fit bubble rules. Grandparents: Single parents: If you are single: You can read the government's guidelines in full here. If you don't live on your own, or you are not a single parent whose children are under 18, then the rules haven't changed. However, you can, of course, invite someone eligible to join a social bubble with your household. Otherwise, you must meet people you don't live with outside. The number of people you are allowed to meet depends on where in the UK you live. Basically, when people mix - especially in crowded places - coronavirus can spread. The virus is transmitted by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. That's why people have been asked to maintain social distancing when meeting anyone not from their household. Bubbles allow some people more contact with others, while keeping other social distancing measures in place. Who will be in your social bubble?

        "text": "The NHS has listed three main symptoms of coronavirus, that people should be aware of and ready to act upon. If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus. Follow James on Twitter.

        "text": "The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls. A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. If a recession carries on for a long time, or is particularly bad, it is known as a depression. For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls. This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession. In the UK, the economy shrank by 2% from January to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. It then shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - in its first full month in lockdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK. In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts. The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer. It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than \u00a3300bn to cover the cost of the crisis. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid. The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be. If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back. So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come. A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery. But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend. But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further. Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come."

        "text": "Some secondary school pupils in England are due to return on Monday. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements vary widely, with many schools offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years 10 and 12 from Monday. But only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time. Students who do return will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September \"at the earliest\". Plans to get all primary pupils in England back for four weeks before the summer holidays have been dropped. But some nursery and pre-school children - plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - started to go back on 1 June. Not all schools have reopened, some due to local council advice and some because they don't have the staff or space to safely accommodate eligible pupils. Some parents have chosen not to send their children back. On 4 June, 659,000 children in England - or 6.9% - are estimated to have been in classes. Many schools have been open throughout lockdown for vulnerable children and those of critical workers across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June to all age groups - but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Plans in England include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could be different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is \"very, very small, but not zero\", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools are not ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says exams will take place in 2021 in England. \"We are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach to this,\" he told MPs. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?

If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No-one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Manual tracing was meant to be launched in mid-May, in tandem with an app that would automatically alert users if they have been in contact with another user with coronavirus. The manual element launched in England on 28 May.  The app is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight and hasn't been released more widely, although business minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested it would be in place by the end of June. At the government's briefing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to be \"confident people are following the advice given by human beings\" before the app was introduced. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, and has recruited 2,000 contact tracers. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop the danger of the virus spreading. You should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine and live alone, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. If you live with other people they won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England's tracing system would be \"world-beating\". On launch, the government claimed the tracers could track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day. There were 8,117 people testing positive referred to the scheme in its first week, but just 5,407 of those provided details of recent contacts. Those people provided 31,794 contacts, 26,985 of whom were reached and agreed to self-isolate. The government says some people who tested positive couldn't be reached either because their contact details were unavailable or incorrect or they didn't respond to attempts to get in touch. When recent contacts were given, in some cases those details were incorrect,  or contacts either did not respond or refused to self-isolate. Over three-quarters of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate within 24 hours. Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading England's track and trace system, said: \"We clearly have more to do make sure we reach everyone and more to do to speed up the end to end service.\" The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. It's currently voluntary, but the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply \"we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house\". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is \u00a395.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions."

        "text": "Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in England may soon be able to reopen their doors for the first time since lockdown began in March. But despite the easing of restrictions, a trip to a local bar or dining establishment could be a very different experience from how it was before coronavirus. In its recovery strategy document published on 11 May, the government said that the hospitality sector - which includes pubs, bars and restaurants - could start to reopen \"no earlier than 4 July\", if Covid-19 safety guidelines could be met. The government has yet to announce details of what these guidelines would be, but they're expected to include rules on social distancing, heightened hygiene procedures and protection of bar and restaurant staff. It will provide \"further safer working guidance\" for restaurants, pubs and bars \"as soon as we can\", Business Secretary Alok Sharma said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. On 20 March, all pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes were asked to shut in order to stop the spread of coronavirus The only exceptions to this were cafes and canteens at a few selected places such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Since then, many restaurants have started offering food delivery and takeaways in order to generate income while their doors are closed. Some pubs have also been allowed to offer takeaway beers. Each nation of the UK is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: The chief worry for many people in the hospitality industry is the issue of social distancing. Some have insisted that the current 2m distancing rule makes it impossible for bars, cafes and restaurants to make a profit. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the industry body UK Hospitality, says that with a 2m rule, outlets would be only able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would increase that to 60-75%. Some Conservative MPs have added their support for reducing social distancing, and the prime minister said on 10 June that the 2m rule was \"under constant review\". The Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca says it is considering a range of measures to keep staff and workers safe amid the pandemic. Customers are likely to be given the option of ordering food on apps, while staff will be encouraged to wash their hands every 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the Wetherspoons pub chain has said its staff will be provided with face masks and protective eyewear and it will run a reduced food menu. Bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise will be replaced by individual sachets. Customers will also be encouraged to sit outside in pub gardens, while some indoor seating areas will be separated by Perspex screens. The hospitality sector was the third-largest employer in the country in 2018, according to UK Hospitality. But many restaurants and cafes were already struggling even before the Covid-19 outbreak, in the face of rising rents and falling consumer spending. Since lockdown began, job cuts and closures have been announced by chains such as Frankie & Benny's and Carluccio's.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs \u00a3130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be \"months\" before going to a restaurant Thousands of workers in the industry have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, which allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to \u00a32,500. Many other countries have already reopened restaurants, bars and cafes around the world. In some cases they have had the use of lower social distancing recommendations - in France, for example, the recommended distance between customer and staff is 1m."

        "text": "Lockdown measures are being eased further after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England from Saturday, households containing one person, or one adult and children, can form a ''support bubble'' with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. People can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. In Scotland, eight people from two different households can now meet up outdoors if they maintain social distancing. It is recommended that eight is the maximum group size and that people do not meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors. Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although up to 10 people can now attend outdoor weddings and civil partnerships. In all four nations, permitted numbers of people includes children, and social distancing - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others - should be followed unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble.  The rules are different for people who are shielding. The overall advice remains \"stay at home\" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis are all allowed in England. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should still not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. Wales and Scotland do not want households to travel more than five miles if possible, but 11 Conservative MPs have questioned the Wales decision. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed that hotels and tourist accommodation can reopen on 20 July. Most people entering the UK - including British citizens - now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so \"for the foreseeable future\". People who must travel to their workplace are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive if possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport, on which they are likely to face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Read the government advice in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now spend some time outdoors again. Those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can now go outdoors. In Scotland, \"adjustments\" are anticipated in the coming weeks to the shielding guidelines. House moves and viewings have resumed again in England. Potential buyers and renters are able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. However, the government's plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term is now being dropped. Instead, schools will be given \"flexibility\" over whether or not to admit more pupils. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. From 15 June in England, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their \"continued remote, home learning\". However, at the Downing Street briefing on Monday 8 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September \"at the earliest\". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are \"Covid-secure\". Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Zoos, safari parks, drive-in cinemas and other outdoor attractions are expected to be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June - as long as they follow social distancing rules. Places of worship will also be allowed to reopen for private prayer shortly although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later\", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

This series of maps and charts tracks the global outbreak of the virus. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.

US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. The US has by far the largest number of cases - now more than two million and about 25% of the global total - according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by Brazil and the UK. In China, the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average. Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data Figures last updated: 14 June 2020, 16:53 BST The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and says people should be prepared for new outbreaks, especially in areas where lockdowns are eased.  Globally, at least 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - were living under social distancing measures at the height of the pandemic in Europe, according to the AFP news agency's estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger. While some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise. A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the WHO to say the Americas were the new centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These charts show four countries - Brazil, Mexico, India and Pakistan - where deaths have been on an upward trajectory - as shown by the red lines. Peru, Mexico, Chile and Ecuador are among the Latin America countries which have seen widespread outbreaks, but there is particular concern about Brazil. The country now has the second highest official death toll in the world and is recording an average of about 1,000 deaths per day. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the risks of the virus and prioritised the economy in his decision-making, even criticising state governors for introducing regional quarantine measures. Elsewhere, India and Pakistan have both seen the number of infections and deaths rise in recent weeks and the healthcare systems in both countries appear to be under strain. In Iran there are fears of a second wave of infections. New cases averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous week. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent so this could be distorting understanding of how far the virus has spread. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. The UK has reported more than 41,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Europe. Italy has the second highest death toll with about 34,000, while both France and Spain are just below 30,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated. Having been on lockdown to control the spread of the virus, European countries are now beginning to ease restrictions. How and when restrictions are lifted varies from country to country, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a \"slow, steady\" approach. The risk of a second wave of infections requiring European countries to re-impose full lockdowns is moderate to high, according to the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases. With more than two million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded more than 115,000 deaths. The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 30,000 deaths in total, but the number of daily deaths has remained below 100 since late May - down from 1,000 a day in early April. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but most states have now loosened their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. Nationally, the number of new cases has remained steady at around 20,000 a day for several weeks, but the situation is not the same in every state. In recent days the governors of Oregon and Utah halted plans to ease lockdown restrictions, citing local spikes in infections. More than 44 million people - more than a quarter of the country's workforce - have applied for jobless benefits since the pandemic hit. The economic downturn in the US has now been officially declared a recession."

        "text": "Most people entering the UK from overseas are now expected to self-isolate for 14 days. But there are still questions about how quarantine will be enforced and why it has been implemented now. Under the new rules, most travellers entering the UK by land, air or sea must complete an online form in the 48 hours before they arrive, stating where they will be staying in the UK while self-isolating and how they can be contacted. They could be fined \u00a3100 for not filling in the form, while there is a fine of up to \u00a31,000 in England for those who are found to be not complying with the self-isolation rules. However, when filling in this \"contact locator\" form, travellers are given the option to not put down an address at all, or to put down more than one. The Home Office says that if someone arrives without a place to stay, then they will have to book accommodation at their own expense at a list of hotels provided, using its bookings system. One reason people can put down more than one address is in case they need to stay in a hotel before moving on to their ultimate destination, or are legally obliged to change addresses, it adds, for example due to a court order. Guidance for border officials, seen by the BBC, indicates that unless the port of entry is particularly quiet, it is likely only \"spot checks\" will be used to see if passengers have filled out the forms. The guidance states that border staff will generally have no way of checking whether addresses are real. They are advised to accept the information given unless other factors suggest there are \"credibility concerns\" - for example \"stating that their name is Mickey Mouse or that their address is Buckingham Palace\". Public Health England (PHE) says it will contact 20% of those required to self-isolate via a phone call and text message. If they have reason to suspect that somebody isn't complying, then their details can ultimately be passed to police who will enforce the measures as a last resort. However, the Home Office says police do not have a right to enter someone's home on the basis of this offence. What's more, there are several reasons why someone is permitted to not be at an address, for example if they need to buy essential supplies and have no-one to do this for them. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the decision to bring in a travel quarantine system now is \"guided by science\", as UK transmission (or the spread of the virus) is low enough for imported cases to potentially cause a \"devastating second wave\". Prof John Aston, the Home Office's chief scientific adviser, says the \"scientific advice so far is clear\" that the impact of the policy would have been \"negligible\" while transmission rates were higher. \"As the number of infections within the UK drops, we must now manage the risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere,\" he says. However, some have questioned the decision to bring in quarantine measures now, when the UK has a higher transmission rate than many other countries. Conservative MP Sir Liam Fox said in the House of Commons last week: ''If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak, and if it is a contingency measure against a so-called second wave, why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have?\" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, suggests bringing in the policy \"would have had some effect\" during the \"containment phase\" of the virus response back in February. But he argues that bringing it in now \"won't have any measurable impact on public health whatsoever\". In late February and early March, the government did advise passengers from affected areas, such as Wuhan in China and parts of Italy, to self-isolate when arriving in the UK, but this policy was dropped on 13 March. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said at the government's coronavirus press conference that \"measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and applied to countries with higher rates\". There was some confusion over whether these travel quarantine rules would apply to the whole of the UK, because border security is a centralised measure, while health is devolved - meaning England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own rules. Ultimately the measure was brought in as part of the Public Health Act, so when the UK government decided to introduce quarantine rules on 3 June they were for England only. All home nations have now made it a requirement for travellers from abroad to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the UK. But they could choose to end the policy at different times, or to vary the rules. For example, workers providing essential healthcare will have to quarantine upon arrival in Scotland but not in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The level of fines issued for breaking the rules also vary. In Scotland, if someone fails to self-isolate for 14 days at a fixed address they will be fined \u00a3480, while in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it's \u00a31,000. In England, an individual will be fined \u00a3100 for not filling out the contact locator form correctly. In the rest of the UK the fine is \u00a360, falling to \u00a330 if paid promptly. There has been a lot of discussion about so-called \"air bridges\", which could allow visitors from countries with low coronavirus transmission rates to enter the UK without having to self-isolate. For an air bridge to open, two countries would have to agree to relax quarantine restrictions. So far, Portugal is the only country offering to open an air bridge to the UK. Sources close to the government have told the BBC that the Department for Transport is keen to open air bridges by the end of the month. \"Quash the quarantine\", a lobbying group of more than 500 travel and hospitality companies, says it has been given \"private assurances\" from senior government sources that travel corridors - which encompass land, air and sea borders - will be in place by that time.

        "text": "With people told to avoid public transport, the government's hoping to trial e-scooter rental schemes - possibly by the end of June. But what are e-scooters and where can they be used? They're two-wheeled scooters with small, electric motors. Their popularity has grown and scooter-sharing schemes now operate in more than 100 cities around the world - including San Francisco, Paris and Copenhagen. People can hire e-scooters, often using smartphone apps, in a way similar to city centre bicycle hire schemes. Electric scooters are freely available to buy in the UK online and in stores, and they cost anywhere from just over \u00a3100 to more than \u00a31000. Currently, you can buy one but you can't ride it on a UK public road, cycle lane or pavement. Anyone who does is committing an offence. The only place an e-scooter can be used is on private land, with the permission of the landowner. At the moment, they are classified as Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs), so they're treated as motor vehicles and are subject to all the same legal requirements - MOT, tax, licensing and specific construction. So, because they don't always have visible rear red lights, number plates or signalling ability, they can't be used legally on the roads. The law covering e-bikes - which are battery-assisted pedal cycles - doesn't currently cover e-scooters, but the government wants to regulate them in a similar way in future. Normal scooters, those without motors, are not allowed on pavements or cycle paths - but they can be used on roads. The Department for Transport wants e-scooters rental schemes - similar to those seen in European cities - tried out across England, Wales and Scotland. Riders wouldn't need to take out their own insurance to hire an e-scooter, but they would need a driving licence or at least provisional one. The hired vehicles could be used - legally - within set geographical boundaries. But it would still be illegal to use a privately-owned e-scooter on a public road, even if you were in a trial area. The government says it will monitor safety and keep the year-long scheme - part of a \u00a32 billion plan to invest in greener travel - under review. We don't know at the moment. As well as bringing forward the start date to the end of June, the government has - in light of the coronavirus crisis - widened the scope of the scheme across the whole of Great Britain. Initially, four \"future transport zones\" were chosen for the trials - the West Midlands; Portsmouth and Southampton; the West of England Combined Authority (Bristol, Bath and surrounding areas); and Derby and Nottingham. The Department for Transport says: \"A high number of areas across Great Britain have expressed an interest in running e-scooter trials.\" If you were to use a hired e-scooter outside of any of the trial areas - yes, you could be fined. Likewise, if you use a privately-owned e-scooter on any public road, cycle lane or pavement. You could get a \u00a3300 fixed-penalty notice and, if you have one, six points on your driving licence. Electric scooters can exceed 30mph (48.3km/h), although many are limited to 15.5mph (24.9km/h). Television presenter Emily Hartridge is believed to be the first person to die in an accident involving an electric scooter in the UK. There are no official tallies on global deaths and injuries, but there have been a number of studies: Some e-scooters have only a single brake, which makes stopping safely more difficult. There are strong advocates for the introduction of electric scooters in the UK. The London Cycle Campaign (LCC) said: \"The arrival of e-scooters offers a cleaner, low carbon alternative to cars and buses for those who can't or don't want to cycle.\" \"LCC is calling for e-scooters to be legalised and allowed to use cycle tracks rather than be used on pavements.\" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"

        "text": "There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 40,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. The latest numbers from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which counts death certificates mentioning the virus, suggests there had been more than 50,000 deaths by 29 May. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for this time of year, the toll rises to more than 63,700 by the same date. Some of these deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Coronavirus accounted for about 18% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 29 May, according to death registration data - a drop from 21% the previous week. In the week to 17 April, when deaths from the virus reached their peak, this figure was just under 40%.

The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil. However, the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons. On Sunday, the government announced a further 36 deaths - the lowest number since 22 March, the day before the UK went into lockdown. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with more than 37,000 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. In Scotland, the official government figure for deaths is 2,448 but data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests it had reached nearly 4,000 by 7 June. In Wales, the death toll stands at 1,444 while there have been 541 deaths in Northern Ireland. Last week's figures from the ONS show the overall death total in the UK for the week to 29 May fell again, nearing the normal range for the time of year. The most deprived parts of England and Wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas, according to the ONS. Urban areas were worse-affected than rural areas and London had significantly more deaths from coronavirus per 100,000 people than any other region. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has found that people from ethnic minorities have a much higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did take into account occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with NHS England figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. The \"R number\" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. The government says the R number is between 0.8 and 1.0 in most English regions - but between 0.8 and 1.1 in the South West. The estimate for Scotland is between 0.6 and 0.8. In Northern Ireland, it is between 0.5 and 0.9, while it is between 0.7 and 1.0 in Wales. The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. The number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in April and the seven-day rolling average shows a clear downward trend. A further 1,514 cases were announced on Sunday. Estimates by the ONS, however, suggest there could be nearly 6,000 cases per day in England alone - not including cases in hospitals or care homes - where people either show no symptoms or have mild symptoms and are not tested for the virus. Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance has said the epidemic \"is shrinking, but not fast,\" suggesting this means moving \"very carefully\" out of lockdown. Cases were originally concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but Wales and parts of Scotland and the North East of England have also seen a high proportions of cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the possibility that there could be \"local lockdowns\" in the future to control the spread of the virus. The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 has been gradually declining since a peak over Easter. On Friday, the government said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus had fallen to 5,607- down from 7,036 at the same time last week. However, the picture is different across the UK's nations and regions, with numbers falling faster in some areas than others. The UK exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. However, the UK Statistics Authority has criticised how the data has been presented, saying the aim appeared to be to show \"the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he would look at ways the information could be \"improved\". The government announced there were 144,865 tests processed or posted in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Sunday. This figure does not represent the number of people tested, as some are tested more than once. At least two million people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK - but the government has been unable to provide an updated figure for that since 22 May. More than 31,000 people were identified as close contacts of people who tested positive for coronavirus during the first week of the test and trace system in England. Of those, 85% were reached by the test and trace teams and asked to self-isolate for 14 days."

        "text": "Testing will be vital to controlling coronavirus outbreaks as lockdown eases. The government says tests are now available to anyone with symptoms, and it aims to process tests within 24 hours by the end of June. In England and Wales you can apply for a swab test for yourself, or for anyone in your household, if you or they have symptoms In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff. Couriers collect samples and take them to laboratories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June, except where there were difficulties with the post. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of the Test and Trace service, has previously said 84% of drive-in centre tests come back within a day. No figure has been provided for home kits. Speed is important because delays give the virus more time to spread. Scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, the stage of infection someone's at when tested, or problems in the lab. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, has called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Testing is essential if contact-tracing systems now in place across the UK are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. And in theory it can help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. But representatives of hospital trusts and care home providers say staff need to be tested regularly, not as a one-off, to ensure this. Testing can also let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On 7 June, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes, some of which may never be returned. It also includes tests carried out as part of a surveillance study by the Office for National Statistics, which don't serve the purpose of diagnosing individuals. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing \"the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test didn't work. A government spokesperson said it was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to \"increase transparency\". There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

        "text": "As lockdowns ease, thermal imaging cameras are popping up in all sorts of public places to assess the state of people's health. Using infrared technology, thermal cameras detect radiating heat from a body - usually from the forehead - and then estimate core body temperature. These cameras are an extremely powerful tool, often deployed by fire fighters to track smouldering embers and police to search for out-of-sight suspects. But they are not designed to be medical devices. So how useful are they in the current pandemic? They can give a reasonable measure of skin temperature, to within half a degree - but that's not the same as body temperature. \"These devices, in general, are less accurate than medical device thermometers like those you stick in the ear,\" says Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science from University College London. About 37C (98.6F). A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or over. But normal temperature can vary from person to person and change during the day. It can also fluctuate during a woman's monthly cycle. Taking an accurate reading of core body temperature isn't easy. Although it can be measured on the forehead, in the mouth, the ear and the armpit, the most accurate way is to take a rectal reading.  37\u00b0C(98.6\u00b0F) normal body temperature 38\u00b0C(100.4\u00b0F) or above, high temperature/fever No, they only measure temperature. A high temperature or fever is just one common symptom of the virus. Others include nausea, headaches, fatigue and loss of taste or smell. But not everyone with the virus gets a high temperature and not everyone with a high temperature is infected with coronavirus. So thermal cameras alone will miss infected people with other symptoms or no symptoms at all - known as false negatives. They will also identify people unwell with a fever for another reason - known as false positives. On its own, temperature screening \"may not be very effective\" says the World Health Organization. Cameras have to be set up correctly and take account of ambient temperature. A risk is that cameras can lull operators into a false sense of security. \"They are\u2026 only one tool among many,\" says James Ferryman, professor of computational vision, from the University of Reading. \"Heat radiating from the skin will likely be impacted by wearing face masks,\" says Prof Ferryman. That's why most temperature measurements are based on the forehead, which is usually exposed. Not necessarily. Skin temperature actually goes down during exercise as sweat appears on the surface of the skin. The body is pretty good at regulating its temperature even after exercise, so it would have to be really quite high to show up. With portable thermometers pointed at foreheads. They don't need to touch the skin, but do need to be within a few centimetres of it. While accurate to a fraction of a degree on skin temperature, they correctly detect fever about 90% of the time compared with a rectal thermometer, Prof Hill says. Thermal scanners are now in place at some UK airports - including Bournemouth. Temperature screening is being trialled for some passengers at Heathrow, while Manchester Airport says equipment is also being tested - but results will not be communicated to passengers or \"used to influence whether a customer can travel\". Portsmouth international ferry port has also installed a thermal scanner to screen departing passengers. Schools are deploying hand-held laser thermometers to check children each morning. And some employers are looking at introducing staff-testing in workplaces. Under UK employment law, individuals must agree before an employer can temperature-screen members of staff. Some work contracts will already allow for this type of test to be carried out, by so-called \"implied consent\". If employees do not consent - and there is no pre-agreed policy covering the situation - then taking someone's temperature is unlawful, says the professional body for HR and people development. Employers must also handle the medical information they gather fairly and transparently - according to the Information Commissioner. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

        "text": "The chance of having a summer holiday seems remote - with many UK tourism businesses still shut and foreign travel difficult because of quarantine rules. What is the latest situation? No - not until the start of July at the earliest. Lockdown restrictions are being eased slowly across the UK, but the tourist industry does not yet have the green light to reopen fully. You'll probably be able to get an ice cream at the seaside - and some restaurants and bars are doing takeaway food and drink - but hotels remain closed to all guests, except for a small number of specific groups. Government advice in England says businesses providing holiday accommodation - including hotels, campsites, caravan parks and short-term lets - should stay closed for leisure-related trips. No person should stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose, it adds. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he's keen get the tourism sector going as \"rapidly as possible\" with the government sticking to what it describes as an \"ambitious target\" to get England's tourism sector back by 4 July - \"as long as it is safe to do so\". \"Self-contained accommodation has a lower risk than other areas,\" Mr Dowden told the Commons, \"I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue.\" Hotels in Northern Ireland already have a confirmed date for reopening - Monday 20 July. Zoos and animal parks are shut, as are many national parks. Facilities such as car parks and toilets may not be open either. People are also being urged not to rush to beauty spots such as the Lake District. Visit Cornwall says that people should not travel to the area unless they can return home within 90 minutes. In addition, people who live in England cannot travel for recreation into Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. At the moment, it's difficult. British nationals are still being urged not to take any non-essential foreign travel. This means you are unlikely to get travel insurance, because insurers and airlines take their cue from the official advice. But the airlines are hopeful for the summer season. EasyJet plans to resume some flights this month, while Ryanair and British Airways plan to ramp up their services in July, All TUI and First Choice holidays are cancelled until at least 11 June. Be prepared to self-isolate at some destinations and - if you return to the UK from Monday 8 June - you will have to quarantine for two weeks. Those returning from overseas will not be eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms. All visitors and returning UK nationals arriving by plane, ferry or train will face fines if they break the rules. Certain groups are exempt. UK aviation bosses are hoping a large number of so called \"air bridges\" will be in place by 29 June, when the UK travel quarantine measures are set to be reviewed. These would exempt travellers from quarantine, if they move between countries with low virus levels. The EU has insisted there will be a summer season this year. The European Commission has proposed a gradual lifting of travel restrictions throughout the EU. Seasonal workers and citizens of countries with similar levels of infections could start to travel more freely first. Again, it's impossible to say at this stage. Travel advice will need to have been updated, but it depends on the disease's progress. Remember, holidays and flights booked against Foreign Office travel advice are unlikely to be covered by travel insurance if you end up not able to travel. If your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled, then you are are entitled to a full cash refund. However, lots of people have been struggling to get their money back, and have been offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead. If you are offered a voucher, or a free rebooking instead of cash, you can accept or refuse it. But if the airline later folds, the voucher may no longer be valid. If your airline or holiday company hasn't cancelled your holiday yet, but you no longer wish to travel, you may not be entitled to a refund. However, some providers are allowing people to rebook trips for a later date at no cost. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity.

        "text": "People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.

        "text": "Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a \"gathering\" as a meeting involving \"social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity\". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. \"There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,\" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with this rave in the West Midlands last month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at \u00a3100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. \"So it becomes a balancing exercise,\" she says. \"If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate.\" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. \"If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people.\" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. Chief constables today talk about their public duty to \"facilitate\" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: \"Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you.\" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make \"a case-by-case decision\" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying: \"The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting.\" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets."

        "text": "About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated \u00a310bn to the economy. Ceremonies this year have been devastated by coronavirus, but Northern Ireland will allow small outdoors weddings from Monday. There is no official word yet about the rest of the UK. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to take place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland has allowed weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have been granted emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment\", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act\", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to \u00a330,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."

        "text": "Everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling coronavirus, compared with others. But you have to make sure you're comparing the same things. The United States, for example, has far more Covid-19 deaths than any other country - as of 18 May, a total of more than 90,000 deaths. But the US has a population of 330 million people. If you take the five largest countries in Western Europe - the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain - their combined population is roughly 320 million. And the total number of registered coronavirus deaths from those five countries, as of 18 May, was more than 130,000 - nearly 50% higher than that of the US. The number of deaths is rising faster in the US, but individual statistics don't tell the full story. For comparisons to be useful, says Rowland Kao, professor of data science at the University of Edinburgh, there are two broad issues to consider. \"Does the underlying data mean the same thing? And does it make sense to compare two sets of numbers if the epidemiology [all the other factors surrounding the spread of the disease] is different?\" On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on 10 May, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University said that trying to rank different countries to decide which was the worst in Europe was a \"completely fatuous exercise\". But he referred to \"the bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy\" and said \"clearly it's important to note that group is way above, in terms of their mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark Norway, who have low fatality rates.\" So why is it so difficult to compare individual countries? First of all, there are differences in how countries record Covid-19 deaths. France and Germany, for example, have been including deaths in care homes in the headline numbers they produce every day. But the daily figures for England referred only to deaths in hospitals until 29 April, when they started factoring in deaths in care homes as well. A further complication is that there is no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. Does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics, or are the suspicions of a doctor enough? Germany counts deaths in care homes only if people have tested positive for the virus. Belgium, on the other hand, includes any death in which a doctor suspects coronavirus was involved. The UK's daily figures only count deaths when somebody has tested positive for the virus, but its weekly figures include suspected cases. Also, does the virus need to be the main cause of death, or does any mention on a death certificate count? Are you really comparing like with like? There is a lot of focus on death rates, but there are different ways of measuring them too. One is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of all the people who test positive for coronavirus, how many go on to die? But different countries are testing in different ways. Early in the outbreak, the UK mainly tested people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital. That can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country with a wider testing programme. The more testing a country carries out, the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms, or perhaps no symptoms at all. So, the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate. Another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a country's population - the numbers of deaths per million people, for example. But that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached. If a country's first case was early in the global outbreak, then it has had longer for its death toll to grow. The UK government compares how each country has done since recording its 50th death, but even that poses some problems. A country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and reduce the eventual death toll. When studying these comparisons, it is also worth remembering that most people who get infected with coronavirus will recover. It is more difficult to have confidence in data which comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems. Is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like China or Iran accurate? We don't really know. Calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population, China's figures are extraordinarily low, even after it revised upwards the death toll in Wuhan by 50%. So, can we really trust the data? There are real differences in the populations in different countries. Demographics are particularly important - that's things like average age, or where people live. Comparisons have been made between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but they are problematic. Ireland has a much lower population density, and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas. It makes more sense to compare Dublin City and County with an urban area in the UK of about the same size (like Merseyside) than to try to compare the two countries as a whole. Similarly, a better though still imperfect comparison for London, Europe's major global city, may be with New York, the biggest global hub in the United States. You also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure. A comparison of death rates between countries in Europe and Africa wouldn't necessarily work, because countries in Africa tend to have much younger populations. We know that older people are much more likely to die of Covid-19. On the other hand, most European countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most African countries. And that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus, as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing. Health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic, but they are not all the same. \"Do people actively seek treatment, how easy is it to get to hospitals, do you have to pay to be treated well? All of these things vary from place to place,\" says Prof Andy Tatem, of the University of Southampton. Another big factor is the level of comorbidity - this means the number of other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure - which people may already have when they get infected. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far. Both Germany and South Korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries. The number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates. But not all testing data is the same - some countries record the number of people tested, while others record the total number of tests carried out (many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result). The timing of testing, and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community, also need to be taken into account. Germany and South Korea tested aggressively very early on, and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading. But Italy, which has also done a lot of tests, has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths.  Italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold. The UK is doing the same thing. So, is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons? \"What you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another, and what you can learn from that,\" says Prof Jason Oke from the University of Oxford. \"And testing seems to be the most obvious example so far.\" But until this outbreak is over it won't be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better. \"That's when we can really learn the lessons for next time,\" says Prof Oke. This piece was first published on 21 April and has been updated to reflect the latest statistics. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

        "text": "As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people. This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: \"Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. \"And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid.\" Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies. How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including: But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events. \"If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,\" Dr Kucharski says. \"If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission.\" Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: \"We found that many of the settings are what we expected. \"So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. \"And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases.\" But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms. All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time. But Dr Knight says there is another common thread. \"These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,\" she says. \"There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky. \"There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. \"So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example.\" Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: \"Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection. \"So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors. \"Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible. \"Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk.\" Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says. Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus. But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed, Dr Cevik says: \"We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. \"But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. \"And that's huge.\" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

        "text": "Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a \"dangerous moment\" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. \"It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,\" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at \"Level 4\" rather than \"Level 3\" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is \"not a lot of room\" for manoeuvre and the data \"urges caution\". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and \"we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate\". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those \"following the science\". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. \"Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,\" argued Prof Calum Semple. Major deja vu feeling to mid March. Scientists incredibly concerned, politicians ignoring this, public doesn't want life disturbed. End of Twitter post  by @devisridhar There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a \"second wave\". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. \"With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,\" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: \"I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. \"It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.\" Follow James on Twitter"

        "text": "The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are \"far from complete and comprehensible\". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had \"temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting\". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. \"People tested\" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with \"void\" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one \"person tested\" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a \"small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test\", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was \"just not happening\". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as \"smoke and mirrors\". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to \"show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding\". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the \"people tested\" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the \"people tested\" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as \"people tested\" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed \"to avoid confusion\". Follow Rachel on Twitter"

        "text": "The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone \"we're all going to wash our hands once an hour\". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says \"wash your hands\". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."

        "text": "It was supposed to be a celebratory bodysurf, a chance to train together again the night before the official start of the summer season. But a month ago in The Hague, five gregarious, athletic young surfers lost their lives in freak sea conditions, on their first return to the water since coronavirus restrictions had forced them apart. Joost, Sander, Pim, Max and Mathijs fell victim to a thick wall of metres-high foam and rough seas. The bodies of four were recovered within 24 hours. Then last week I watched as firefighters extended a ladder to recover 23-year-old Mathijs's body from boulders beneath the lighthouse at the end of Scheveningen pier. Gazing at the waves crashing on to the rocks,  I shared the sense of disbelief that still perforates this coastal community. The five were all experienced surfers and coaches. Their surf school said they had classes scheduled for the whole week and a final blog posted a few hours before their deaths showed they were itching to hit the waves. The group had discussed the foam and considered going in at another point, another surfer who survived told friends. But both wind and current had changed rapidly. An unusually strong north-northeasterly and a suffocating avalanche of algae foam proved a treacherous combination. Suddenly, these experienced, responsible young surfers trained to save others were unable to save themselves. \"You just hope the moment of frantic panic was over fast,\" Joost's childhood friend Timo van de Ven told me. He still struggles to accept they won't be coming back. Dutch sea rescue service KNRM said the strong wind and current made their operation \"a tricky job\". Scheveningen is known as the surf capital of the Netherlands. It's a popular destination that relies on storms near the coast to generate decent, rideable waves. I live a 10-minute cycle away from the spot where the surfers died. Year-round we watch surfers dashing into the icy North Sea, propelled by the thrill of catching a wave. They bob and dip on the horizon like seals in their sleek black-and-blue wetsuits. \"The grief in the Scheveningen community is unimaginable,\" said Johan Remkes, acting mayor of The Hague. \"People here understand better than anyone else that the sea gives and the sea takes away, but the way so many young lives are now being broken down and so many families and groups of friends have been affected is uniquely cruel.\" What's striking about the deaths of these experienced surfers is that they were doing something so normal, in a stretch of sea they knew like the back of their hands. Friends congregated on the stone steps leading down to the beach a week after their deaths. Cafes closed by the coronavirus crisis played tunes to crowds of students. Surfers tried to console one other, wrapped up in hoodies and each others' embrace. Police on bikes circled respectfully from a distance, allowing people to be together when they were meant to stand apart, leaving friends to grieve and not worry about infection. \"It's helped to feel part of a wider grief, going there and being among people who understand,\" a friend of the group told me. The five were not just socially active, they were known across the community, among all ages. Tributes alongside a sea of flowers outside The Shore surf school offered a snapshot of the five who touched so many young lives. Five beer bottles stood alongside framed photos and notes like \"RIP, wild hearts\"; a poem circulated on social media with the opening line, \"The waves are silent witnesses on an even quieter beach.\" It felt unusually still on the beach for days afterwards, as if the shock had reverberated on the sand and disrupted the breezy atmosphere. Joost Bakker, 30 Surf instructor Joost was described by friends as a stereotypical surfer. As a lifeguard, he was well aware of the hazards. He moved to The Hague to be close to the sea, converting a van to spend more time by the shore. Bakker coached autistic children and once organised a sponsored cycle ride from Norway to Gibraltar to raise money for a charity that supports people with cancer. His friend, Timo van de Ven, knew him since they were 12. \"After the intense emotion of the first few weeks, the finality is the hardest part. He died doing something he loved, the last photo shows him smiling from ear to ear, getting ready in his wetsuit. That's some consolation.\" Sander Dikken, 38 He was enthusiastic and competitive and loved to swim between the piers at Scheveningen. He too was a lifeguard and surf instructor, and studied kinesiology (the mechanics of body movement) at the University of Groningen. That enhanced his teaching at Health by the Sea (Gezond aan Zee), where he worked alongside Joost. Pim Wuite, 24 He was one of the younger surf coaches at Gezond aan Zee. A condolence note shared by his hockey club speaks of a smiley, sweet young man with boundless energy, leadership skills and commitment to youth training. Cricket-loving friends laid flowers on the beach and remembered how his parents would often provide lunch for the team. He was meant to visit Bali this year, until flights were grounded by the coronavirus crisis. Max Verheijen, 22 The youngest of the five, he was close to completing a degree in mechanical engineering in Delft, near The Hague. A snowboarder who switched to the sea, Max was described by his family as smart, friendly and always ready to have fun. His body was carried in a casket through the central Dutch village of Muiderberg where he grew up, followed by pallbearers carrying his beloved surfboard decorated with a bouquet of white roses. Flags flew at half-mast and some draped wetsuits over the flagpoles in memory of the boy who lived for the waves. Mathijs van Dulst, 23 He was a children's hockey coach and referee, and had been looking for someone to sublet his room in the house he shared with 14 others. Photos of his room show a cluster of snow and surf boards propped up in a corner of his bedroom. A tribute on his hockey club page says he trained the younger kids and showed the older ones how to party. \"We carry them forever in our hearts,\" reads a tribute from their colleagues at their surf club, \"Our friends are gone. You live on in our hearts.\" The nature of their deaths has intensified the anguish and confusion that cuts beyond the surfing community. What is hard to understand is how they were caught up in freak conditions when a short distance away other people continued riding the waves into the sunset. The sea foam that led to their deaths comes from a type of algae called phaeocystis globosa. Scientists from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research (Nioz) have worked out what they think must have happened. Colonies of algae are held together by a mucous-like matrix that protects the cells and allows them to rapidly increase in size. The algae need sunlight and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate, and a sunny start to May helped the cells grow rapidly. The sea foam off Scheveningen was found to be four times the average peak seen in the past 10 years. However, cloudy weather the day before the tragedy triggered the disintegration of the algae colony into an \"unparalleled\" quantity of individual cells. Viral infections caused the cells to burst open and a Force-7 wind and strong seas whipped them up into a large amount of foam. The north-northeasterly wind drove the foam against a harbour head before the currents changed and the foam moved towards the beach. The scientists believe lifeguards and water sports enthusiasts need to be alerted to the potential risks of high levels of sea foam. They say it will take time to establish a proper warning system for the future, to prevent further accidents. Meanwhile, five white fish have been painted on the rocks at Scheveningen near the spot where Joost, Sander, Pim, Max and Mathijs were last seen alive."

        "text": "Finally, the support bubble means you can get that hug or kiss from someone you've been waiting three months for. From this weekend, you can get up close and even stay overnight with someone else, if you meet the strict rules. Yet it's a massive dilemma for housemates - which of you gets to see your partner? And in the last 24 hours it has all been kicking off in that department. Unlike Love Island once you've bubbled up with someone you can't change your mind. So rock, paper, scissors for who gets to fly their wings? Radio 1 listener Kate came on BBC Newsbeat to talk about her situation, which seems to be working out. \"It was the easiest choice of my life. I'm bubbling up with my boyfriend.\" Kate got lucky her housemates gave her the green light. \"They kindly said I could be the one who extends my bubble, it was my birthday a couple of days ago, so an extra birthday present for me.\" What lovely people - not the case everywhere though. Space Pup writes on Twitter: \"Cool, so because my housemate is forming a bubble with her boyfriend, I get no bubble. No bubble for me.\" That's right no bubble for Space Pup. This latest relaxation of the lockdown isn't going to be policed - so there's every chance housemates will simply bend the rules. But what about those trying to do the right thing? Another route to decide who gets the pass could be an Apprentice-style pitch to a Zoom board between housemates. For others though, they didn't even get to have the conversation about who gets to bubble. Bubbling only applies in England right now, each UK nation is coming out of lockdown in different ways. Another way for housemates to choose could be to see who's gone without sex the longest. Give them the golden ticket? Or if there are three of you in a flat and you all have your own love interests, it could be a time to draw straws. Then you have the case of siblings. Only one can visit their parents. That could leave the other with a new 'friend' in their house, like Jamie. Lockdown is being eased gradually and a line has to be drawn somewhere - and some people will always fall on the wrong side of it. It's not forever. But don't tell that to this fella. Gabriella Miller is a lifestyle coach in crisis management. \"This is a very heightened experience,\" she tells Newsbeat, \"but I think it's important for everyone to calm down and take a step back.\" Gabriella wants people to remember it's a changing situation and people will get to see their loved ones again soon. \"In the grand scheme of things, whether it be your relationship with your boyfriend, flatmate, friend or family, this will be a moment in time, but at present, it unfortunately feels all consuming. \"Perhaps it's worth asking yourself whether it's worth falling out with people over this?\" She thinks in some circumstances this could be a time to be selfless. \"The worst thing that can happen right now is for people to damage relationships over this, as now more than ever, we're learning just how important these are.\" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

        "text": "The pandemic has seen carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fall as fossil fuel use has collapsed. But will these changes be permanent? From electricity giveaways to the virtual end of fracking, the global lockdown has seen huge changes in the way we create and consume energy. Carbon emissions have dropped dramatically and the air is clearer over major cities as car traffic has disappeared. But as demand for energy picks up once again, there are some large, unresolved questions about how we power our lives in the years to come. Many experts believe this is the moment to shift our power generation and transport system to sustainable, climate-friendly alternatives. To get to that place, some key questions need to be resolved. One of the most extreme changes brought about by the Covid-19 crisis is the glimpse it has given us of how our electricity systems might work in years to come. An important aspect of that is the idea, seen during the pandemic, that there are times when consumers are paid to use energy. During the coronavirus lockdown, electricity consumption was down across Europe by around 15%. But because of a very sunny and windy spring, supplies of renewable energy boomed. Wholesale electricity across Europe is priced on an hourly basis for the day ahead, so abundant supplies and weak demand saw prices go below zero at times. Negative prices were once a rarity, but they plunged into the negative 66 times in April in the UK. On Tuesday 21 April, UK prices were in the negative from 09:00 to 16:00. They dipped to just under minus \u00a384 per Megawatt hour at one o'clock. For grid operators worried about too much power in the system, it's often easier for them to pay customers to use the power than to shut down the generators. Consumers who had signed up to flexible, real time tariffs with one UK energy supplier found themselves encouraged to use electricity when it went negative. \"You're doing a service to the National Grid,\" says Greg Jackson from Octopus Energy, the company who encouraged their customers to use more during negative pricing episodes. \"The grid is going to pay someone to deal with this problem of oversupply. They will pay a company to build batteries, or they will pay companies to stop generating or you can pay customers to use electricity at those times.\" \"These are all different ways of providing the service of balancing the grid.\" On that April Tuesday, Octopus Energy customers were getting around 4p per unit of electricity they used. Not a fortune, but perhaps a sign of things to come. The transition to a greener future means that grids will face huge influxes of power from intermittent suppliers, while demand will probably fall. Flexible pricing will likely remain a feature. \"This is a clear signal that the era of big, centralised 'base-load' generation is over, and that the future will be powered by renewables, energy storage and flexible power plants,\" said Bj\u00f6rn Ullbro, from W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Energy Business, a power sector company. So how have the grids coped with conditions during the Covid-19 crisis that many believed wouldn't occur for years? \"Much better than I would have ever thought they would,\" is the verdict of Dave Jones, an electricity analyst with climate change think tank, Ember. \"Across Europe, they're coping remarkably well. They have less of an isolated electricity system because they have interconnectors, so you don't have quite the same highs and lows as you do within the UK.\" \"But faced with this, and the challenges of staff getting ill and having to go off into isolation, just keeping the lights on and keeping the electricity system operating through this is a minor miracle in itself.\" One of the most significant potential outcomes from the Covid-19 crisis has been the disruption to shale oil drilling in many parts of the US. Hydraulic fracturing or fracking has become the main plank of a massive shift in US energy production over the past decade. Fracking uses of a mixture of water, sand and chemicals under high pressure to crack open oil- and gas-bearing rocks. When combined with horizontal drilling technology, production of oil and gas soared. According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2019, shale oil accounted for 63% of America's total crude oil production. Shale even saw the US become the world's number one exporter of oil for a brief period last year. But the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent drop in demand for oil has hit fracking very hard indeed. According to EIA figures, the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the US has fallen by 56%. In the Permian basin, North America's largest shale region, the number of rigs fell from 405 in March to 175 in early May. So does this dramatic drop signal the end of fracking? \"People have called doom on the fracking industry many times,\" said Bethany McLean, an author and expert on the business. \"But there are a few things that are different right now.\" \"I do think oil production will be significantly lower than it was because I don't think the capital is going to return to the degree that it did in the past.\" \"And I think public market investors are disillusioned with the sector.\" \"But to call the death of fracking, just because the economics don't work, might be going too far.\" One major factor that might help revive the fracking industry after Covid-19 is politics. President Trump has so far shown little interest in bailing out fracking directly. His administration has been more focused on supporting Saudi Arabia and Russia in their efforts to cut oil production and drive up prices. But higher oil prices may hit US consumers at the petrol pump. Not a great idea in an election year. \"Right now, when oil is such a significant part of US industry, especially in Republican states, it is very challenging for the government,\" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, an oil market analyst with Rystad Energy in Oslo, Norway. \"They are trying to balance the low oil prices they have always liked, with having an oil price that is high enough to prevent their domestic industry from dying.\" That balancing act could very tricky for fracking. It is highly likely that after the pandemic, governments will be asking themselves if atomic energy makes sense, given the challenges the world is facing. Supporters say that, during the crisis, nuclear plants provided around 40-45% of the low carbon electricity used in Europe. Because of the existing focus on safety in the industry, they have coped well with Covid-19, say sources. And they are well placed to cope with an ongoing health crisis. \"Safety is already embedded into the culture, so embracing some of the additional safety required to deal with Covid-19 has been something I think that was very easily taken on by the nuclear industry,\" said Jonathan Cobb, from the World Nuclear Association. \"And there hasn't been a situation where, because of infections or people self-isolating on a precautionary basis, there's had to be a close down of a nuclear power station.\" What makes the industry bullish about the future is that governments will want to invest in large infrastructure projects to provide employment, while at the same time greening their energy systems. While much of the investment in nuclear has taken place in China and Russia in recent years, the time could now be right for more reactors in Europe and the US. \"We have got the first power stations under construction in the UK, we've got construction in Finland, in France, but also in Eastern Europe, there's been continuing new build,\" said Jonathan Cobb. \"So we've got a high level of new build already with more than 50 reactors being built around the world. And, yeah, the hope is that this will now accelerate and increase.\" While there are worries about accidents and nuclear waste, some electricity experts believe nuclear energy is not flexible enough for modern grids, made up of lots of different energy sources. \"The flexibility of nuclear has always been a problem in this,\" said Dave Jones, an electricity analyst at Ember. \"It runs 24/7 with very little ability to be able to reduce load around the outside of that, which is what the National Grid would actually need.\" Coming out of the crisis, there is a great deal of hope - and indeed quite a deal of hype - around hydrogen as an energy source. Hydrogen can be made from natural gas, but as that's a fossil fuel, it needs to have its carbon captured in some way to make it  sustainable. However a \"greener\" version can be produced from water, by using renewable energy to power a process of electrolysis. As well as not producing any CO2, the resulting gas doesn't contribute to air pollution when it's burned. Advocates believe it could be the answer to one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, heavy transport such as lorries and buses. \"As good as batteries are in lighter, smaller vehicles, they are less applicable in larger vehicles, generally because of the weight,\" said Eamonn Ives, from the Centre for Policy Studies, who has published a report on how hydrogen could be key to decarbonising transport. \"At the scale of something like a bus or a truck, you could be talking at least a couple to a few tonnes in weight, purely in the batteries themselves.\" \"When you get to have that sort of size, hydrogen does appear to be quite an elegant solution to decarbonise lots of vehicles.\" Hydrogen's strength is its versatility - as well as powering lorries and buses, it can be used in the mix for gas to heat our homes. And in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, the EU and Germany are both keen on increasing investments in this future fuel. The gas does come with some big challenges - making it with green energy is not hugely efficient as yet. It also needs to be kept under pressure to use in vehicles, which right now are very expensive. For energy campaigners, hydrogen has great potential, as long as it is made from renewables, and doesn't become a smokescreen for the continued use of fossil fuels. \"The fact that there's currently so much focus on hydrogen gives us hope that the hard-to-decarbonise sectors like aviation and shipping will finally find a solution to their decarbonisation dilemma. So in that sense, we are positively welcoming this hydrogen discussion,\" said Laura Buffet from Transport & Environment, a Brussels based campaign group. \"We don't want to see a situation where we ended up supporting fossil-based technologies and that really would be counter-productive.  We need to be careful and make sure that we have the right safety safeguards in place to ensure that the hydrogen roadmap focuses on renewables-based hydrogen.\" Perhaps one of the strongest positives for hydrogen is that it attracts support from across the political spectrum, unlike wind or solar. \"I think it appeals to the conservative side of the political divide because in many ways hydrogen is kind of like diesel or petrol but without the bad stuff,\" said Eamonn Ives. \"And so you can quite easily transition, say, the transport fleet over to hydrogen without making an awful lot of change to behavioural patterns.\" My colleague Justin Rowlatt has taken a look at the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on coal in a separate article. Like coal, the future for other fossil fuels is now uncertain and depends to a large extent on how governments spend their stimulus packages. One of the most critical questions is over oil. Over the last 10 years, the rise of the diesel- and petrol-powered SUVs around the world has really helped CO2 emissions ramp up. In fact, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 - after the power sector. Thanks to the drop in car travel and aviation, fuel oil demand has now fallen away dramatically. Initially, there were concerns that the world would run out of storage, as producers were determined to keep pumping. But Opec (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) agreed to reduce output just in time. \"If Opec had not cut, we would be in huge trouble,\" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, with Rystad Energy. \"But because they did cut production, the Armageddon situation - where the world storage space was not enough to handle the volume - didn't happen.\" Now, experts are expecting a rise in demand, as countries emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, and if Opec maintains the same level of production cuts, prices will start to rise. Longer term, analysts believe there will be a strong rebound in oil prices, as many oil drilling projects that were due to start this year and next have been put on ice. \"It basically means that we will have less supply than we will otherwise need,\" said Paolo Rodriguez-Masiu. \"So for the last part of 2021, and the beginning of 2022, our prices [will be] quite bullish.\" But even if prices rise, some experts say the writing is on the wall. \"We have seen the oil majors reiterate their commitment to clean energy and spare renewables from any cost cuts,\" said Dr Valentina Kretzschmar, from global energy research consultancy, Wood Mackenzie. \"Recovery in oil and gas prices is unlikely to slow down the transition. However, what is likely to slow it down is increasing demand for oil and gas products, as economies start to come back to life.\" \"It is now more important than ever for governments to act and commit to rebuilding economies on green principles. The EU is leading the way with its Green Deal. We also need to see stimulus packages being tied to companies' commitments to carbon reductions, following the example of Canada.\" \"Equally, financial regulators need to step up pressures with mandatory reporting on climate-related issues.\" Follow Matt on Twitter."

        "text": "Students must decide by the middle of next week whether or not to accept university offers for the new academic year. It's a big decision - even more so this year, with many lectures due to take place online and socialising very difficult. Universities are currently considering how they will operate from September, and many of them have already decided to alter their normal schedule. Plans include: You need to contact individual universities or check their websites to find out what they have decided. Deadlines to decide on whether to accept offers have been pushed back to 18 June. You make two choices - a firm first-choice university and an insurance, or back-up one, and then decline any other offers. If you meet the offer conditions of the first choice, you are in - otherwise the back-up alternative comes into play. Even then, you are not committed to going if you choose not to. Places at specific universities can be cancelled online, and if you decide not to go to university at all, you must phone the ones holding you a place to ask for your application to be withdrawn. None of this will leave you out of pocket. The government says university students in England will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn. However, some students are unhappy about this. One started a petition, demanding a refund for lost teaching, after face-to-face teaching ended in March. It gained more than 330,000 signatures, enough for a parliamentary debate. The maximum UK university tuition fee is \u00a39,250 a year, which is totally covered by a student loan, although international students may pay more. Scottish and European Union students pay no tuition fees for attending a university in Scotland. Accommodation costs can vary, but usually run into several thousand pounds. Maintenance loans for living costs are means-tested, so you have to make up the difference, which often means falling back on parents. Claire Sosienski-Smith, a National Union of Students (NUS) official, told the BBC: \"We would recommend that students think carefully before signing any binding contracts or agreements for next year, especially in the case of rental contracts.\" Some students had their accommodation fees removed for the cancelled summer term, but others had to pay, even though they were unable to stay at university because of the lockdown.  2.38 millionstudents in UK higher education 1.8 millionof them undergraduates 480,000students from outside the UK 541,240became undergraduates in 2019 The numbers of students in UK universities could be much lower than usual from September. A survey by the University and College Union found that more than one in five students could defer going to university this year. Universities and colleges take varied approaches to the issue. Some will not allow deferred entry for subjects such as medicine, but will consider it for other courses. However, you need to check that the same course is being offered the following year. You could also be asked your reasons for wanting to defer when your application is considered. A recent study revealed that two-thirds of international students still intend to take up their offers abroad, including in the UK. IDP Connect, which works in global marketing for students, surveyed nearly 6,900 students and found that 69% of them were not changing their plans. However, prospective postgraduate students from East Asia largely favour a face-to-face start in January to an online one in the autumn, according to a British Council study. The survey of more than 15,000 students, carried out in April and May, also showed that UK universities are likely to have nearly 14,000 fewer new enrolments in 2020-21, compared to 2018-19. This would lead to a drop of \u00a3463m in spending on tuition and living expenses. A plea from universities in England for a \u00a32bn bailout from the government was rejected. However, to help with cashflow, \u00a32.6bn of tuition fee income and \u00a3100m of research funding will be brought forward. The universities can also access the Treasury's support for businesses disrupted by coronavirus, worth another \u00a3700m. The number of new UK and EU students is going to be controlled by the government, which may add extra numbers in some cases. Half of any additional capacity would be given to people studying courses like nursing. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the \"curve\" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced \"R-naught\", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

        "text": "A Reddit post by a woman who explained her mixed emotions at receiving an out-of-the-blue apology from her first boyfriend during lockdown prompted dozens of others to share details of their own experiences. The BBC spoke to a man who has sent two unexpected lockdown apologies - and to a woman who has received one. It was another Friday evening in lockdown, of staring at a computer screen, toggling between news sites and social media, when the email from James arrived. Irina waited a beat, trying to recall the last time she had thought of her first boyfriend, before clicking it open. \"Irina, I know this is out of the blue and years too late,\" it began, \"but this is a message I need to send.\" She had been 16 and ready for a boyfriend when she met James. It seemed like a normal step a girl her age should take. So much of her life hadn't been typical. Born in Moscow, Irina had come to the UK on a two-week student exchange and liked the education system here. At the age of 14 she told her parents she wanted to leave Russia and go to a British boarding school. After initial hesitation, they gave in. Irina's mother had been a railway conductor from a rural part of Russia when she fell in love with Irina's father, a passenger on her train. She was 19, he was 30. Weeks later she packed her bags and knocked on his door, 1,000 miles away, informing him that they should now live together. How could they deny their daughter her own big adventure? Arriving in England, Irina felt the culture shock immediately. Growing up in Moscow, Irina's inner-city school had been, in her words, \"hardcore\". There were fights in the toilets and open bullying. Here, she was amused by mandatory chapel visits and the invisible social hierarchies of an English school. Irina found her way into the ecosystem and made friends. Over time, and after a giggly afternoon in a park, one boy in particular caught her eye. James fitted the brief for a cool boyfriend. He was cute. He was funny. At 17, he was a year older than Irina. He was tall, too. They texted over the next few weeks, and soon their relationship became official, though the cracks appeared right away. \"When you're that age, status amongst friends is very important,\" Irina says. \"And it was very important for James to appear cool.\" In public there were jokes at Irina's expense among their mutual friends. In private, James was frustrated if she appeared to be better than him at some things. \"If I was better than him at crosswords he would be insulted and say, 'But you're Russian, your English shouldn't be as good as mine,'\" Irina says. \"And I would reassure him by saying, 'It's not, I'm just good at crosswords.'\" Eventually, two years later, Irina was told by mutual friends that James had confessed he'd cheated on her. Irina ended the relationship abruptly, distancing herself as best she could, telling him she didn't want contact. She moved to a different city for university and a fresh start. James texted sporadically over the next couple of years - always on her birthday, and to wish her happy new year. Eventually, after one exchange, Irina suggested to James that for them to successfully move on it would be better if they cut contact altogether. James' response was swift and icy. He wasn't trying to get back together with Irina, he wrote. Then he told her to never message him again. Irina stared at the message and responded, Lol. That, she decided, would be the end of this chapter of her life. Years passed and Irina moved again, settling into a tech job. Now at ease making friends, she found her rhythm in a new city. When coronavirus hit, Irina's work sent her a keyboard and a large monitor so she could work from home. And then the email from James arrived. In the 800-word-message, James explained that lockdown had forced him to assess his own past behaviour, and he felt he owed her an apology for his immaturity all those years ago. He apologised about how he had behaved, saying that he felt mortified when he read the texts he had sent her. And then he made a stunning confession. He had never actually cheated on Irina - that too had been a lie to impress their friends. He went on to write that he had been volunteering to help vulnerable communities during lockdown and now was a time for true reflection and for people to be kinder to one another. Transported back in time, with a mix of emotions she hadn't felt in years, Irina went for a walk to clear her head. When she got back, she decided to reply. She told him to be kind to himself and said that everyone has made mistakes, especially when they are young. And then she addressed his apology. I don't have a reaction to your apology. Perhaps I have forgiven you, perhaps I stopped caring. I hope it brings you closure to know I feel no ill feelings towards you. She thought for a moment, wondering if this was a fair response. \"I think he was looking for redemption from me,\" Irina says. \"But it's not really for me to give it to him. He's the only one who can give it to himself - forgive himself.\" Irina sent the email and went back to her computer, her evening and her life. It was 10 days into lockdown when Chris texted Sarah. The last time he'd seen her she was on the floor of her room, curled up in the foetal position, tears and hiccups breaking up her breathing. He left her that way. She wanted him to. This was the end result of a long and emotional conversation, and the conclusion of their eight-month relationship. He thought of her occasionally in the years that followed. They still followed each other on social media. But she had faded into memory, a college girlfriend. Now, seven years later, that image kept popping back into Chris's mind: Sarah on the floor in tears. Chris began lockdown on 10 March, the day the US National Emergency Commission advised restaurants and bars to close, and a presidential directive asked people to work from home where they could. The week before, a typical day for him started at 5.30am. He'd work out with his colleagues at the army base in Missouri where he worked as an IT engineer, go home, shower, eat and go back to the base. He lived alone in an apartment nearby. After finishing work he'd go home again and either go out with friends, or make dinner and hang out online until it was time for bed. With lockdown came a lot of free time. At first he kept busy. But after 10 days of Zoom calls and YouTube workouts and the whole second season of Succession, his mind kept going back to that image of his first girlfriend. He'd met Sarah when they were 18, at a military academy. \"It was an intense relationship,\" Chris, now 26, says. \"We spent all of our time together, all our plans were together and so was our identity.\" As teenagers at the start of their career with the US Army, they shared all their problems with each other. As the months went by, though, Sarah's troubled relationship with her family began to consume her, according to Chris, and he felt ill-equipped to help. When he finally told her all this, saying he didn't think they could carry on, Sarah dissolved into tears on the floor. She was devastated. This was too abrupt an end to their relationship, she said. They avoided each other for the rest of their time at the academy, sometimes awkwardly. Then they graduated and went their separate ways, and that's how it stayed - until, on 19 March, Chris sent Sarah a text. Sarah, I understand that it's been a long time, but I really feel that the way that we ended things wasn't right, and the way that I treated you at the end of our relationship was a disservice to you. I know we've both had a lot of time apart from each other and I would really like to make that up to you. I really hope you're doing well. The response came almost immediately. I'm doing great! And the two began to exchange texts. She brought him up to speed on her new teaching job, which she loved. And, she added excitedly, she had a much better relationship with her parents. \"She said for a while she couldn't see me [because I was] someone who had caused her pain, but that was all over now,\" Chris says. \"She said she now realised that we weren't right for each other.\" Emboldened by the warmth of their interaction, Chris decided to text a second ex. Well, ex may be a stretch. \"We were more friends with benefits,\" he says. \"We didn't ever say we were exclusive.\" Lisa and Chris had matched on Tinder in 2016. They lived in different cities. She lived in Washington DC, where Chris had family. The relationship was carried out mostly online. \"We chatted on almost every single social media app and then mostly by text,\" says Chris. In the beginning they had video chats but that gradually decreased. They saw each other every few months, hooking up when they were in the same place. Over the next couple of years that petered out too, eventually settling into an online friendship. Then on New Year's Eve 2018 Lisa and Chris found themselves in the same city and arranged to meet up to ring in the new year, along with a mutual friend. Lisa had a new boyfriend, Sam, by then. She'd told Chris about him, even sharing points of tension she felt in their relationship. It was the first time Chris and he had met. The night began in a friendly enough tone but soon everyone was drunk. And in the midst of a blurry conversation Chris brought up something Lisa had told him in confidence about her relationship with Sam. It was so personal that Chris knew as soon as he spoke that he had broken the trust between them. After an argument outside, Lisa, Sam and their friend left Chris to go to another venue. Lisa later texted Chris to say how angry she was that he had shared her confession with Sam. It was the last time Chris saw Lisa. So after his message to Sarah, Chris texted Lisa. You were and are very important to me, and I'm sorry for everything that I did that night. I know that I crossed a bunch of lines and I wish I hadn't. I hope you're doing well and lockdown is OK. Lisa's reply came the next day. She said she was well. Lockdown was going OK, and she and Sam were now married. But it was clear that she didn't wish to continue the conversation. She didn't address or accept Chris's apology. Chris says that he hopes he would have apologised to both women in time, even if lockdown were not a factor. \"But maybe it would have been a drunk text in the middle of the night.\" He says he accepts that apologies may be seen by some as selfish, because they answer the sender's needs, and not necessarily the recipient's. But he says he wasn't expecting either Sarah or Lisa to say anything that would make him feel better. \"I can't say I wasn't doing it in the hope that they would absolve me... I wasn't expecting a reply from either. And if they hadn't forgiven me it would have been fine by me too. I just wanted them to know that I wasn't OK with some of my past behaviour.\" Nastaran Tavakoli-Far is the co-host of The Gender Knot, a podcast that explores cultural issues. She's hosted \"loads and loads and loads\" of shows on the psychology of an apology and what motivates someone to make one. Lockdown, she says, adds another dimension. \"There's the obvious reason why we are reflecting on our behaviour, we've all got a lot of time to think. A lot of the things we do to avoid reflection aren't possible right now, like travelling, socialising, commuting. \"At the same time it's an opportunity to become thoughtful about your relationships and ask all these big fundamental questions of the purpose in your life and what your legacy is.\" But apologies need to be thought through, she says. \"You should never give an apology to feel better. Making an apology is only the first step to making amends. You need to be ready for the person to respond in any way they need, and not at all if they want. \"While you have time to think about the bad things in the past, so does the person receiving the apology, and you may trigger an emotion in them that they don't necessarily want right now.\" All names of those making and receiving apologies have been changed Have you received an apology from your ex during lockdown, or sent one?"
