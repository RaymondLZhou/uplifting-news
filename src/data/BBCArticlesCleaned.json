had done a huge amount of work to allow for safer shopping but he said people must continue to respect social distancing measures it comes as a further 36 deaths from coronavirus were announced in the past 24 hours it brings the uk death toll   across all settings   to 41698 the latest daily figure is the lowest since before lockdown began on 23 march but there tends to be fewer deaths reported at the weekend because of a reporting lag while food shops and pharmacies as well as other essential retailers including banks and petrol stations have been open throughout lockdown non essential stores such as book shops and fashion outlets have been shuttered since 23 march the prime minister said he was very optimistic about the opening of shops but stressed the most important thing is public safety and the health of our country he said it was difficult to tell whether there would be a huge wave or a trickle of customers on monday but urged the public returning to the shops to observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely with fewer than 1 in 1000 cases in the population people had made a huge sacrificeand we cant throw it away mr johnson said by katy austin business correspondent not all shops will raise the shutters on day one the reopening will be gradual but for many its an important opportunity to welcome spending customers back in store having spent time and money preparing safety measures in line with covid secure guidelines shop owners are hoping the public will have the confidence to return and that they will follow rules on queuing and hygiene some expect an initial surge of activity others expect much lower levels of trade in the coming months compared to before the crisis one reason is that social distancing will limit the number of customers in store another is that the experience will be different there will be less spontaneous browsing for example and no relaxing at a caf\u00e9 or restaurant while most hospitality venues remain closed the lockdown also accelerated the move towards online shopping with fewer physical stores likely to be needed in future mr johnsons comments echoed those of chancellor rishi sunak who earlier praised retailers extraordinary efforts to create a covid secure environment from monday most retailers can open as long as they follow safety guidelines those who fail to ensure their premises are covid secure could face enforcement notices plastic screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m 6ft 5ins apart   already a regular fixture in supermarkets   will be a key feature other measures will include pleas not to touch items unless customers intend to purchase them and decontaminating shopping baskets after each use it comes as mr johnson faces increased pressure to ease the 2m social distancing rule which many ministers see as crucial to the further reopening of the economy mr sunak told the bbc the government would actively look again at the measure given its enormous impact on the profitability of businesses you are right to highlight the impact it has on business   it is the difference between maybe three quarters and a third of pubs opening for example so it is important we look at it it is understood the review will aim to report back by 4 july   currently the earliest mooted date for the reopening of pubs bars restaurants and hairdressers in england while other countries have enforced a lesser distance of 1m just over 3ft in keeping with the world health organizations recommendation  the uk governments scientific advisers have so far maintained that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart ultimately it is for ministers to decide said mr sunak we are the people who are elected to make decisions in this country people should hold us responsible and accountable for making those decisions the chancellor acknowledged many people would be anxious at the prospect of going out shopping again after almost three months in lockdown but he stressed it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence shops up and down the country are desperate to welcome us all back and i think we all want to see our high streets spring back to life again he said designer mens clothing retailer brother2brother will be reopening its reading store on monday for the first time since march buying director steven hall said the firm could not wait to reopen although the shopping experience might be different from what customers are used to   with staff provided with ppe and a limit of six customers at a time in addition to cleaning of counters after every purchase and cleaning of the changing rooms after use we will also have to quarantine the goods for at least 24 hours before they are put back into circulation he added that customers will be encouraged to try things on at home and return them where possible and pretty much everything will be given a sale price as the company looks to shift its seasonal stock one way the store is attempting to drum up business is by letting customers book 30 minute slots allowing staff to prepare a selection of items suited to their tastes if we dont try to innovate and make sure business can operate at some sort of level we probably wouldnt be here for very long mr hall said more than half of uk customers expect they will now go shopping less according to a survey of more than 1000 people by accountancy giant ey and andrew goodacre chief executive of the british independent retailers association believes people may soon become weary of queuing the british retail consortium brc the trade body for retailers is urging the public to play their part in making shopping safer along with 25 other retailers it says

        "text": "theres been criticism of a study from the us suggesting that the coronavirus could have been present in the chinese city of wuhan as early as august last year the study by harvard university which gained significant publicity when it was released earlier this month has been dismissed by china and had its methodology challenged by independent scientists the research which hasnt been peer reviewed is based on satellite imagery of traffic movements around hospitals in wuhan and the tracking of online searches for specific medical symptoms it says there was a noticeable rise in vehicles parking outside six hospitals in the city from late august to 1 december 2019 this coincided says the harvard report with an increase in searches for possible coronavirus symptoms such as cough and diarrhoea this would be an important finding because the earliest reported case in wuhan wasnt until the beginning of december the academics write while we cannot confirm if the increased volume was directly related to the new virus our evidence supports other recent work showing that emergence happened before identification at the huanan seafood market the harvard study has gained a lot of traction in the media with president trump who has been highly critical of chinas pandemic response tweeting a fox news item highlighting the researchers findings the tweet has been viewed more than three million times the study claims there was an increase in online queries for coronavirus symptoms particularly diarrhoea on popular chinese search engine baidu however baidu company officials have disputed their findings saying there was in fact a decrease in searches for diarrhoea over this period so whats going on the term used in the harvard university paper actually translates from chinese as symptom of diarrhoea we checked this on baidus tool that allows users to analyse the popularity of search queries like google trends the search term symptom of diarrhoea does indeed show an increase in queries from august 2019 however we also ran the term diarrhoea a more common search term in wuhan and it actually showed a decrease from august 2019 until the outbreak began a lead author of the harvard paper benjamin rader told the bbc that the search term we chose for diarrhoea was chosen because it was the best match for confirmed cases of covid 19 and was suggested as a related search term to coronavirus we also looked at the popularity of searches for fever and difficulty in breathing two other common symptoms of coronavirus searches for fever increased a small amount after august at a similar rate to cough and queries for difficulty in breathing decreased in the same period there have also been questions raised about the study using diarrhoea as an indicator of the disease a large scale uk study of nearly 17000 coronavirus patients found that diarrhoea was the seventh most common symptom well below the top three cough fever and shortness of breath across the six hospitals the harvard study reported a rise in cars in hospital parking lots from august to december 2019 however weve found some serious flaws in their analysis the report states that images with tree cover and building shadows were excluded to avoid over or under counting of vehicles however satellite images released to the media show large areas of hospital car parks blocked by tall buildings which means that its not possible to accurately assess the number of cars present in the tweet below weve annotated with white boxes the areas obscured by the tall buildings the angle of the images shown in the @abc report on this block out portions of the parking space that would  tarnish the data relied upon to suggest a trend in cars present in the hospital parking spaces h t to @fang__z for first highlighting this pictwittercom odtcflbot8 end of twitter post  by @bendobrown theres also an underground car park at tianyou hospital which is visible on baidus street view function but only the entrance is in view on satellite imagery   not the cars underneath the ground one of the authors of the study benjamin rader said we definitely cant account for underground parking in any time period of the study and this is one of the limitations of this type of research fundamental flaw in @harvards report in looking at cars at hospitals to suggest early covid signs was failure to look at underground parking here is entrance to tianyou hospital underground carpark in 2017 it was full https  tco didhh35m9a h t @crushspread & @wanyuan_song pictwittercom c5mupay2wd end of twitter post 2 by @bendobrown there are also concerns about the choice of hospitals for the study hubei women and childrens hospital is one of the sites included but children rarely require hospital treatment for coronavirus in response the authors say their findings would still show increased car park usage overall even if this hospital were to be excluded from the survey the researchers could also have compared their data with hospitals in other chinese cities to see if the rises in traffic and search queries were specific to wuhan being where the outbreak first came to light without that comparison in addition to the questions weve raised about online searches for medical symptoms the evidence for wuhan residents receiving treatment for coronavirus from august last year remains highly contestable there is however still much we dont know about the early spread of the virus in wuhan read more from reality check send us your questions follow us on twitter"

        "text": "as some year 10 and year 12 pupils in england prepare to go back to school on monday secondary head teachers are having to overcome an array of challenges plans shared with the bbc suggest the arrangements will vary widely more than 300 schools and colleges told us they were mainly offering between five and 30 hours of face to face teaching each week some are making the return gradual starting with pupils who are struggling the most with many providing individual pastoral sessions to check on mental health the sixth form colleges association says schools and colleges should ensure that extending face to face teaching does not impact on support for pupils who are still at home at ivybridge community college on the southern slopes of dartmoor in devon principal rachel hutchinson has been putting the final touches to plans for welcoming back just over a quarter of the colleges 2500 students the year 10 and 12 pupils who will be doing their gcses and a levels next year will return to a very different school from the one they last saw in march safety measures are key says mrs hutchinson were working very much with social distancing measures looking very much at the timetable and what we can do safely and sensibly but shes also determined to give them an effective education pupils arrive by school bus public bus and train some are dropped off while others walk or cycle new mask wearing and social distancing rules on public transport plus a ban on sixth formers car sharing mean clear communication is key she says each school bus can now carry just seven students which means that while bringing back a quarter of the pupils is feasible larger numbers might be impossible she says at ivybridge even these smaller numbers of students will have to be part time to ensure safety it means only about 100 will be in at any one time with only 10 in each class for year 10s there will be one full day of teaching each week with 90 minutes each of maths english and science the other subjects will continue to be taught remotely on the days pupils are at home theyll still get their full curriculum says mrs hutchinson the post 16 students will have seminar days to reduce movement around the site theyll get two full days of each a level over the five weeks before the end of term says mrs hutchinson we think its very viable its do able and its really important for their education there are 2m distancing markers along all the corridors and a one way system staff in high vis jackets will monitor every entrance there are hand sanitising stations and lots of posters and banners to remind children not to crowd each other its going to be that supermarket feel   when you go to a supermarket for the first time with the trolley queues she says with reduced numbers its manageable she says but increased numbers of students would present a challenge id like to think as a college weve been really strong on our pastoral care says mrs hutchinson tutors have had lots of email contact with students with fun remote activities like cake baking to keep pupils engaged with the school community however she recognises some will have fallen behind and so there is a recovery programme to help them catch up she says a key aim of returning to school is to ensure pupils wellbeing and she will keep a particular eye out for socially disadvantaged children about 30 children have opted to take up the colleges offer of one to one tutoring with support available for families who have suffered bereavement or illness or are anxious she says one of the most important aspects is getting it right for my staff she says they are absolutely working round the clock to maintain communication the pastoral welfare and wellbeing of the children as well as checking in on the learning some have their own health issues many will be running busy households without childcare and may feel anxious about returning to face to face teaching its managing staff welfare and making sure that staff feel safe and are ready to come back to work she says years 7 8 and 9 will continue to be taught virtually and pupils in years 11 and 13 whose exams were cancelled will still get support its keeping an eye on a number of schools really our virtual school as well as the new school thats going to be returning the exciting thing is for the first time ever children are saying they miss school says mrs hutchinson getting the college back to a new normal for september is another challenge it will be welcoming the new year 7s plus a huge group who have not been in school since march mrs hutchinson says that unless the distancing measures are amended schools will have to run a blend of classroom lessons and virtual learning in september she believes the idea of schools opening over the summer when staff have already been flat out since march is quite controversial the summer six weeks are going to be key for us to get ready for september she argues   and many staff will have to work through to prepare so to open for children in as well will be incredibly challenging she says she hopes both children and teachers can take their normal summer holidays ready for a new start whatever form it will take wales will begin opening schools on 29 june with scotland and northern ireland waiting until august"

accounting for 982% of the population   and the south west region being the least diverse in england she began to face challenges she had never even thought about from having racial slurs shouted at her from passing cars to being singled out in class when the history of slave trading was being taught cheveay 20 explains in her own words what it was like to grow up as a black person in one of englands whitest places i was born and originally lived in london when i was six years old i moved to camborne in cornwall with my mum ali thats where her family lived so we did it to be closer to them my mum is white and my dad is jamaican but it wasnt until we moved to the south west that i encountered my first racism experience i was in year two and must have been about seven or eight years old in infant school i had been in cornwall for about a year or so some boy called me a brownie i was so confused about the fact he would use it a lot to tease me this isnt only my first memory of racism its my first memory ever i remember my mum came into the school to address it and how the mother of this boy started crying she was really upset and felt really guilty i had gone to school in london before this so id gone to nursery and reception there a lot of my classmates were from all over the world then to come to cornwall and be the only black child   i was not used to this sort of thing i had never even thought of it it made me think whats wrong with me and then i was suddenly aware of being different in that area my mum struggled with how to explain it all to me she had to tell me that i might have to face this kind of stuff in my life people saying these things and making judgements based on my skin colour i did struggle with fitting in with particular groups as i got older i dont know whether that was predominantly because i was black though as a person generally i was quite isolated in that sense as well i moved friendship groups a lot and didnt really enjoy school we barely covered any black history at secondary school except for one topic on the slave trade when i was about 14 or 15 years old it resulted in a teacher singling me out in front of the whole class of white students asking me how i felt to be the only black child i just remember this sinking feeling i was already very aware i was the only black child in that classroom i was really embarrassed and felt naked i remember my mum being very upset about it there were so many occasions that have stuck with me i remember having the n word shouted at me from passing cars this happened on multiple occasions it was humiliating there were people who said ive never been with a black girl or who felt they could continue to ask more personal questions i was scared to meet peoples parents in case they didnt like me or judged cornwall is a beautiful place with some beautiful people who are so accepting and without prejudice but there is still a very backwards old fashioned mindset there it was hard being mixed race as well as people would say oh youre so white or you act so white what does acting white mean im acting like a person theres no acting white or acting black im a british person when i would call it out people would ask why i was using the race card but it was because they were being racist it would get to a point where i would just allow people to say these things to me and i wouldnt call it out i would let people use certain racial slurs like the n word i would allow it or otherwise i wouldnt be accepted looking back at my younger self i kind of wish i was stronger as a person and strong enough to stand my ground i think because i was so scared about not being accepted and not having any friends i just allowed it if i was the person then that i am now i would have not allowed myself to be treated that way i recently joined in an anti racism protest in london with my cousin it was really such a lovely experience to see that many people come together of all races goes to show it isnt about white fighting black its a fight against racism to see the amount of respect people showed for george floyd and all the other people who lost their lives was amazing there was one point we were kneeling in complete silence everyone was on the same level there was no judgement from anyone and to feel that included was so nice this whole movement at the moment and the way people are coming forward with their own experiences thats what made me want to speak out i hope i can help other people to use their voice i think education is key its about educating people to understand that if you see someone who looks different in a place where the majority of people are white or black it shouldnt make a difference to what you think of this person one thing i try and do is not get upset with the person who is being racist because theyve learnt it its not them as a person it can be unlearnt its about getting them to understand being mixed race i have one side of me thats white that i can educate and a black side that i can empower and help become equal im aware i have two races i can help as told to hayley westcott"

        "text": "making headlines is never something that has motivated kathy sullivan already in the history books as the first us woman to complete a spacewalk in 1984 the 68 year old found herself in the news again this week after becoming the first woman to travel almost seven miles 11km to reach the lowest known point in the ocean the two missions total opposites in the minds of some represent two extremes of a lifelong passion for dr sullivan to understand the world around her as much as possible i was always a pretty adventurous and curious child with interests wider and more varied than the stereotype of a little girl sullivan told the bbc in a phone interview from the pacific ocean she was born in new jersey in 1951 and spent her childhood in california her father was an aerospace engineer who along with her mother would always encourage their two children to think freely and join in with discussions they really fed our curiosity on anything we were curious about or interested in she says they were our best allies to explore that interest further and see where it might take us it might die out in a couple of days it might be something that became our best hobby or it might turn into the central focus of our career by the time they were five or six it was already clear her brother wanted to grow up to fly aeroplanes sullivan meanwhile became fascinated by maps and learning more about the interesting places on them both of our careers have basically been remarkably wonderful fulfilments of those early dreams she reflects as a little girl sullivan was already devouring every newspaper magazine and television report she could find on the subject of exploration it was a time when jacques cousteau was making pioneering undersea discoveries and the mercury seven were propelling the image of astronauts into americas mind i saw these people   they happened to all be men that didnt bother me i saw there are people in the world that have continually inquisitive adventurous lives theyre going to places no ones been and they have this store of knowledge and theyre learning more my way of thinking about it never crystallised into i want that job i want that title or that label she explains about her ambitions as a teenager but what i knew really clearly was what i wanted my life to be like i wanted it to have that mixture of inquiry and adventure and competency her pursuit first took her into foreign languages and then as an undergraduate into the study of earth sciences back then around 1970 it was an area still overwhelmingly male dominated the guys went out to field camps and they dressed all grubby and they never showered and they could swear and be real rowdy little boys again to their hearts content she says her presence was treated like a disturbance to their fun sullivan felt that by this time there was already some change under way she was never for instance harassed or bullied for her gender in fact in a couple of key instances i had some tremendously supportive male professors and colleagues that were definitely definitely on my side and just saw me as a very capable fellow student very capable geologist very capable fellow shipmate sullivan saw in her marine science professors her ambitions for her own life realised   and so began to further her studies in oceanography she applied to nasa as a way to deepen her knowledge of the earth further still my primary motivation for applying to be an astronaut was   if i somehow beat the odds and actually got chosen   i could get to see the earth from orbit with my own eyes sullivan was admitted into nasas class of 1978 it was the first recruitment drive that brought women into its astronaut ranks six were selected from the class of 35 and sally ride seen on the far left of the image above became the first of them to fly into space in 1983 ride would later recount the unique challenges of being the first women recruited into the space program engineers tried to design special make up kits and wildly overestimated how many tampons would be needed for week long missions sullivans first mission sts 41 g set off on 5 october 1984 it was the 13th flight of nasas space shuttle program and the sixth trip for the space shuttle challenger on 11 october 1984 sullivan made history when she became the first american woman to leave a spacecraft along with fellow mission specialist david leestma on a spacewalk to demonstrate the feasibility of an orbital refuelling system she went on to take part in two more missions including the 1990 launch of the hubble space telescope she logged 532 hours in space in total and was inducted into the astronaut hall of fame in 2004 my spacewalk was three and a half hours long its a spacewalk that counts but thats actually very short as spacewalks go sullivan says i was just delighted to see women come after me and do you know much more elaborate much more complicated much more demanding spacewalks over the years sullivan has also been buoyed to see women increasingly involved at senior levels throughout the space program   including in commanding roles and managing missions from the ground these are all wonderful things and i think help show young girls that you can make your way to these places she says no ones promising you a primrose path you know youre gonna have your setbacks youre gonna have to persist and persevere youre going to have to fight back sometimes but the door is at least ajar   its not wide open but you can make your way through it last year an all female spacewalk eventually happened for the first time it was a nice little bookend moment for sullivan especially given christina koch wore the same life support system backpack sullivan had all the way back in 1984 upon leaving nasa in 1993 sullivan went on to serve as chief scientist at the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa and later as its administrator under president obama between those positions she spent years as president and ceo of the center of science and industry cosi and in a distinguished position at ohio state university the surprise invitation for her latest adventure came from victor vescovo a former naval officer and investor who has spent years and millions of dollars on technology to take people underwater to the depths of our planet the challenger deep is the deepest known part of the earths seabed part of the mariana trench it is almost seven miles 11km below the oceans surface 200 miles southwest of guam in the pacific ocean it was first reached in 1960 by two men   us navy lt don walsh and swiss oceanographer jacques piccard   and has only been reached a handful of times since including by titanic director james cameron vescovo a keen explorer himself has said the primary motivation for his private endeavour is to spur interest in the sea and science last year he became the first person to visit the deepest points in every ocean using his two tonne deep sea vehicle dsv limiting factor launched from dedicated support ships sullivan said he contacted her via email to invite her on his latest mission because he thought it was really time for a woman to get down there she suspects it was her friendship with don walsh the oceanographer first to reach the challenger deep that earned her the recommendation after researching vescovos endeavour she excitedly agreed last sunday she accompanied him down more than 35800ft 10900m inside the two person submersible   becoming only the eighth person and first woman to reach the bottom she describes the journey as like being inside a magic sphere seeing the lander   an unmanned robotic vehicle that descends to the seafloor   alongside them at such depth was like stumbling upon an alien space probe she says i mean its just magical that we can go to these places because of the ingenuity and the engineering prowess of these teams of people we can take our bodies to places that we really have no business being and we can do that essentially in street clothes i mean i ate lunch 31000ft below the surface of the ocean on sunday thats crazy 5 facts about this weeks challenger deep dive with @caladanoceanic and @eyosexpeditions 1 it takes about 4 5 hours to descend and ascend2 depth of 10925 m +   6 miles3 no fish4 22 degrees f inside the sub  5 c5 pressure at the bottom reaches 16000 psi pictwittercom dwy6utymyv end of twitter post  by @astrokds eyos expeditions which organised the expedition also facilitated a call between the pair and the international space station iss when they emerged   a fitting representation of the two extremes of humankinds exploration in a press release for the dive the organisers drew the comparison between vescovos enterprise and what is being done with spacex   saying they both show the exciting potential of private companies contributing to technological advancement worldwide sullivan believes that as nations and individuals we should continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge about the world we live in she also expresses her hope for improved diversity and female representation across the world of science technology engineering and mathematics stem the stereotype is a very dull person in a lab coat that just knows numbers and just knows principles she says but in so many fields where science and technology are at the core of what youre doing its completely creative so does she have any plans for her next adventure i think exploration can take many forms   it doesnt have to be venturing off physically to the middle of the pacific ocean or to the earth orbit she says there are topics there are subjects that there are lots of dimensions to exploring i think i will be exploring until they put me in a little wooden box at some point in the future"

        "text": "scenes of streets in lockdown health officials wearing ppe dangerously contaminated surfaces and a battle with an invisible enemy are set to feature in a new tv drama from sunday but the events depicted in bbc ones the salisbury poisonings took place two years before the coronavirus pandemic began the three part series is based on the events of march 2018 when the wiltshire cathedral city faced one of the biggest threats to uk public health in recent years sergei skripal and his daughter yulia were found slumped and foaming at the mouth on a city centre bench having been poisoned with the deadly nerve agent novichok the government would later conclude it was an assassination attempt by two agents of russian intelligence service the gru its an extraordinary story which salisbury is still recovering from but the dramatisation isnt some kind of james bond style spy thriller the skripals are only seen briefly at the beginning of the first episode and the russian suspects are not shown at all instead it focuses on the response of the local community and health officials we were drawn to the stories of the people who had to clean up this mess rather than the people who made it says declan lawn who co wrote the script with adam patterson its about ordinary people who have to pick up the pieces we thought thats where the drama was where the emotion was we didnt want to do the obvious thing which would have probably been an espionage drama but i hope that what weve done is show that there are people out there who take a bullet for us they are a hidden network of people who keep this society together at the centre of the the salisbury poisonings is tracy daszkiewicz played by anne marie duff the director of public health for wiltshire she had been appointed just three months before the skripals were poisoned but had worked for wiltshire council for more than a decade in reality daszkiewicz played an integral role of the response to the poisoning but avoided media exposure   in part to not betray the trust of local residents together with the police she used cctv to work meticulously to find out who the skripals might have come into contact with on the day they were poisoned and took a cautious approach to protecting the public to us now it seems perfectly logical says duff referring to how common certain health measures have become since coronavirus of course we close our doors and windows and wear masks but at the time it seemed like she was being thoroughly extreme and overreacting but whats glorious about tracy is her background her background is in social work shes very grassroots she comes at things from a tactile level so shell ask what do we know to be true what do we know if someone has food poisoning what if the water source becomes contaminated both skripals survived the attack as did det sgt nick bailey a police officer who was one of the first to respond to the attack but a local woman dawn sturgess died after coming into contact with the substance several weeks after the initial attack on 30 june ms sturgess and her partner charlie rowley became unwell at a house in amesbury eight miles from salisbury after spraying a bottle of perfume containing novichok on her wrists the perfume had been given to her as a gift from rowley who had found it in a charity shop bin he said it had been disguised as a well known perfume brand and was in sealed packaging actress myanna buring who plays ms sturgess says the portrayal of her in the salisbury poisonings may surprise those who remember media coverage of her death in 2018 a lot of us remember a lot of news outlets describing her as homeless and a drug addict and in doing so sort of dismissed her death as inevitable because of her life choices buring recalls and that simply was not true she was not homeless she was not a drug addict she was a woman who had experienced mental health issues and knocks in life which i think all of us can relate to she did struggle with alcohol but she was working really hard to turn her life around she had a loving family partner friends it can often take a long time for a tv drama or film to be made about a real life event but the salisbury poisonings has been turned around relatively quickly indeed the series was only completed in the last few months director saul dibb explains we filmed our last sequence the week before lockdown on 23 march and after that we finished it remotely it just had this creeping sense of resonance as coronavirus took over us the drama was filmed mainly in newport south wales plus bristol and other parts of the south west rather than in salisbury itself duff has said producers were very sensitive about where to recreate certain events nonetheless there has been some criticism of the drama including from ds baileys parents who said in a letter to a local newspaper last year that the series was inappropriately premature ds bailey himself however did not object and has met the actor who plays him rafe spall like itvs recent drama quiz the bbc has decided to broadcast the three episodes on consecutive nights rather than risk losing momentum and audience interest by making them weekly as a drama it works as a narrative on a number of different levels says dibb its partly a domestic drama partly a thriller and partly a very prescient virus horror of this invisible enemy that can kill lots of people so it was about finding ways to harness all of those things to be able to tell a story which i think all of us felt had the potential to be more than a straightforward docu drama and its extraordinarily surreal this weird thing happening in the middle of this small british cathedral city that even if you were directly poisoned or not everybody   it seemed to me   became contaminated by this poison the salisbury poisonings starts on bbc one at 2100 bst on sunday 14 june"

        "text": "my money is a series looking at how people spend their money   and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make here laura tarver from oxford takes us through a week in her life during the coronavirus pandemic laura is 35 and lives in abingdon just outside oxford with her husband two year old daughter and cat she works part time as a speech and language therapist both for the nhs and privately her husband tim is a doctor in her spare toddler free time laura enjoys running and during lockdown has taken up learning the ukulele online over to laura i am woken at six by my little girl izzy shouting from next door today i am working from home while she goes to the childminder our time during lockdown has been quite varied at the start i tried to juggle my two and a half days of work around childcare being very thankful that i didnt work full time i then had a very brief stint being redeployed as a home carer within the nhs and now that things are starting to get back to normal i am starting to work as a speech and language therapist again thankfully while izzy continues to go to the childminder today the childminder fees for june come out   \u00a3563 for the month although the government pays 20% of this as part of the tax free childcare scheme as all of my work is usually schools based it is not known yet how long we will have to work from home for   we are starting to try to carry out more therapy online but this is tricky with many of the children i work with as a very small plus side working from home is saving me money and time on commuting which is often an hour each way in oxford traffic i spend \u00a333 on filling up the car today which i have to do significantly less often than pre lockdown total spend \u00a3596 today during my lunch break i pop out to pick up some clothes and a toy trolley for izzy which i found advertised on a hand me on baby and toddler site i follow on facebook these sites have saved me a fortune over the last few years as well as avoiding buying new when not needed generally i like to get as much as possible from places such as this charity shops or second hand sales although with those not being available over the past couple of months i have had to get a few bits like toddler sandals and shorts during my weekly shop our fortnightly cleaner also starts back today hurrah although a bit of a luxury i feel that this \u00a320 a fortnight is more than justified by the number of arguments it saves in our marriage in the evening i take part in an online ukulele course shown on facebook in non covid times these take place in a pub in oxford although lockdown has obviously limited our opportunities to go out i was never able to make this class in person due to izzys bedtime so having the chance to do it online now is a plus the class organiser has kindly made the class fee voluntary \u00a36 for those who are on limited finances at this time total spend \u00a326 lots of bills go out today making me feel considerably poorer our mortgage is \u00a31000 a month while a combination of various insurances cars house pet mobile phone council tax and a couple of charity and professional subscriptions comes to \u00a3314 we try to review these fairly regularly to check that other subscriptions havent sneaked in that we are no longer using but they do seem hard to pare down i pop to the supermarket to get a few bits we are missing and somehow end up spending \u00a318 this includes a big bag of compost   like half the country ive got into gardening during lockdown because i dont have a clue what im doing anything that doesnt die feels like a bonus   and i cant wait to see if we get anything edible out of it in a couple of months time i also treat myself to a takeaway chocolate milkshake from a local cafe \u00a33 this is the first time ive had the chance to do something like this in weeks and feels like heaven later on i buy an e book for a bargain \u00a32 i usually tend to try to get books out from the library or from the charity shop but again with those options out of action at the moment i have been getting a few online total spend \u00a31337 today me and izzy head to the supermarket for our main food shop of the week this comes to \u00a363 which is a bit less than usual although most of our spending has gone down during lockdown our supermarket spends have definitely gone up   probably due to less eating out and feeling like we deserve some treats at home in the afternoon i take izzy for a bike ride near our house on her balance bike lockdown has meant ive got much better at finding these close by free activities whereas before it was always easiest to sign up to classes like music or gym classes for easy entertainment its nice to have time to play at home a bit more and not be so tied into a schedule as well as saving some cash in the evening i carry out some private speech therapy online pre lockdown i saw four or five children privately every week this has now decreased to only two who i see online i havent yet got my head around how to provide therapy online effectively for everyone i see but need to start thinking about that if the situation is unlikely to change for a while for the moment though this does mean we are around \u00a3200 \u00a3300 a month worse off total spend \u00a363 today we have a lovely walk with a friend her toddler and two month old   the first time ive met the little one while its great to be allowed to meet up again i am missing our usual options of a cup of tea in someones house or a cafe especially given the looming rainclouds still its another free outing we also treat ourselves to our weekly lockdown takeaway this week lebanese this has been a little treat to ourselves since the option was taken away of going out for dinner to pubs cafes etc although ironically we used to manage this much less than once a week its also the time in the week that me and tim make to sit down and have a proper conversation which can often get missed with work and toddler bedtimes we are making our way through all the local places still offering takeaway food in our town   all to support the local economy of course todays was \u00a340 quite steep but gives us enough food for tomorrow lunchtime too total spend \u00a340 more blogs from the bbcs my money series today me tim and izzy meet up with some different friends to help them walk their dog our child entertainment options have changed a lot since lockdown previously we would have relied a lot more on paid activities such as soft play farm parks and cafes now we tend to have a walk or a cycle ride with a packed snack for izzy its enlightening to see that she gets just as excited by these smaller cheaper trips as the previous bigger ones although she does keep asking for different activities she is going to do when virus gone although we have definitely saved money on our weekend trips out we did compensate for being at home so much with a 10ft trampoline unfortunately the good weather has turned so we hide out at home in the afternoon with a film we also have to jumpstart the car note dont let your toddler play at driving without checking the lights are switched off at the end i clearly dont learn from my mistakes as the same thing happened a few weeks ago with the other car luckily this time we dont have to end up shelling out for a whole new battery total spend \u00a30 another day another walk with friends this time we go to a local farm park which has opened up a few walks past the animals and woop woop the cafe so we spend \u00a32 on parking and \u00a3550 on ice creams for us all its been lovely this week catching up with friends we havent seen for so long this afternoon despite having time to cook we were all feeling super lazy so we got dominos pizza \u00a320 which made me feel a bit guilty from both a health and money perspective but as always we promised ourselves that next week would be better\u2026 total spend \u00a32750 as it was bill week this obviously made it much steeper than other weeks in the month taking out the bills and childcare costs we spent \u00a3209 on other things which is more than i was expecting before adding it all up it was a slightly decadent week with two takeaways but apart from that i dont think there were any other big luxuries although the amount we spend on food has gone up since lockdown i think spending has gone down on other things such as trips out and shopping for non essentials so i dont think we are doing too badly were looking for more people to share what they spend their money on if youre interested please email mymoney@bbccouk or get in touch via our my money world facebook group or if you live in the uk please join our my money

        "text": "bubble bubble toil and trouble when boris johnson announced the new rules allowing single people who live alone in england the option of creating a bubble with one other household from this weekend he created a real dilemma for some   who to share a bubble with im in the category that is permitted to make that choice as i live alone single parents with children under 18 are also given the option of bubbling up with someone else the new rule allows unlimited visits and even overnight stays between the two homes without the need for social distancing but if anybody in the bubble gets coronavirus symptoms everyone in those households will be forced into self isolation for 14 days   even if they had limited themselves to brief bubble visits rather than staying over once you make your choice you have to stick with it you cannot bounce from one bubble to another some families are facing yet more heart breaking decisions but as a single man without children i can be more relaxed about choosing my bubble   so what are my options im part of a close irish family and the chance of my first proper visit in months to my parents home in time for fathers day is the choice that truly warms my heart but they also have a lovely garden so im already able to go and spend time with them on any day that the weather holds and given they are both in their 70s and i am a key worker going to and from work each day i feel that i might continue to exercise the greatest caution and stick to those outdoor gatherings sorry mum now i must admit i did feel a lump in my throat when a colleagues words prompted me to conclude that due to living alone and the strict social distancing guidelines id not had a hug since mid march nor a pat on the back a kiss on the cheek or any other form of direct human contact my best friend gives the warmest hugs the soundest life advice and as she also lives alone it seems like a beautiful bubble option but as jane austen so nearly said it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of his own home must be in want of a person to share his bubble the government is quick to stress that people who happen to be single but live in a shared house eg with flatmates will not get the opportunity to mingle   unless they have a partner who happens to live alone so i am in a privileged position if the dream woman was to walk into my life this summer surely it is a better prospect to our chances of romance if i can invite her for dinner a deux explaining that i am already in a bubble with my parents would not be a good look ive seen the damage being done to certain people close to me after they handed over their hair maintenance to those they live with but i have been so impressed by the newly discovered skills of some others who have clearly found their inner lee stafford with barbers and hairdressers still firmly closed is it a vanity overload to base your bubble choice on who can best tend to your tresses to be honest the thing that ive missed the most over the past three months is my football fix   but televised matches are back with a vengeance from next week every premier league match is to be televised live im a liverpool fan desperate to see every moment of my clubs bid to end 30 years and two unexpected extra months of hurt and seal a premier league title but i suspect many of the key matches will be claimed by sky sports and bt sport   and i only have a subscription to the first of those all i need is to choose a mate with bt sport for our own transfer deal and a superb summer lies ahead dreaming of beers on the couch as we watch up to four live matches a day makes me nostalgic for the days when frank skinner and david baddiel shared the same set up in real life as well as in the tv studio or the supersized version of the above option my favourite bar is managed by a friend on a live in basis   and from what i can tell she and her boyfriend have the run of the place right now is it too cheeky to propose a bubble link up so i can pop in and legally enjoy their big screen football pool table and jukebox i pledge to do no more than stare longingly at the beer taps as we patiently wait for the day all pubs can reopen those who like to cook love to have people to cook for im lucky enough to have a really talented chef among my friends but just having anyone who loves food to share a dinner table with after so many months of living alone is such an attractive choice and yes if you do the cooking i can bring dessert after so many weeks of life alone at home im genuinely undecided   and i suspect so are many other single people at least those who dont have a pressing family issue to consider and of course you can only make any of these arrangements if someone agrees for you to join them   and no firm invitations have arrived so far lets just hope my bubble dreams dont burst *illustrations by sana jasemi have you created a support bubble as you live

        "text": "a review into the 2m 6ft social distancing rule has been commissioned by uk prime minister boris johnson he faces increasing pressure from his own mps and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together to help businesses after they reopen however the governments scientific advisers say that being 1m just over 3ft apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart the simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected the greater the risk of catching the virus the world health organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m some countries have adopted this guidance often because they also insist on people wearing masks others including the uk have gone further in a study published in medical journal the lancet scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads they concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection the risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m but only 3% beyond that distance and the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m the risk is further reduced by half it can be traced back to research in the 1930s scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground most of those droplets they reckoned would land within 1 2m that is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto and then touching your face proximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes but some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols if true then the flow of wind from someones breath could carry the virus over longer distances prof lydia bourouiba from the massachusetts institute of technology mit used high speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m and a study carried out in chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in covid 19 wards and intensive care units estimated that 4m was a better safe distance but the us centers for disease control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is currently uncertain and whats still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious timing is also key the longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person the bigger the risk scientists advising the uk government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m being exposed to someone coughing is riskier being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance a crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection the direction of air flow is also crucial   whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you and a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference in a restaurant in china where nine people caught the virus the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of covid 19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside scientists advising the british government say every workplace or building should assess the risks and they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible people should only be closer for short periods of time plastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time arranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help and in a growing number of many countries including all parts of the uk people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible it is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it but we still dont know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease until that is established the advice is that the risks are real   and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed"

from saturday 13 june in england single adults living alone   or single parents with children under 18   can form an exclusive support bubble with one other household the second household can be of any size   but nobody who is shielding should join a bubble people in each bubble can visit each others homes and go inside they will not have to stay 2m 6ft apart and can stay overnight it means for example that a single grandparent could pair up with one of their childrens households an adult living alone could mix with their parents or two single friends living apart could get together if anyone in the bubble develops coronavirus symptoms everyone in both households must self isolate if you dont live on your own or with children under 18 only then the rules havent changed for you in england groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside in parks or private gardens in scotland two separate households   up to a recommended maximum of eight people   can meet outdoors ideally travelling no more than five miles in wales any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside as in scotland families should aim to travel no more than five miles beauty spots remain closed in northern ireland groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors in all countries children are included in the headcount and social distancing guidelines   remaining 2m 6ft apart from each other   apply people in england can exercise outside with up to five others from different households in scotland people from two households in groups of up to eight people can exercise outside so having a kickabout with a football in the park is allowed in both countries as long as people stay 2m 6ft apart however full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions individual sports permitted in england with social distancing include athletics golf horse riding and tennis where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household tennis can also be played in scotland and northern ireland   but not yet in wales however golf can be enjoyed everywhere socially distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible prime minister boris johnson has warned people in england it remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families other than to access the garden or use the toilet hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority if you use the toilet while visiting another home you should clean any surfaces you have touched the guidelines in scotland say that for a barbecue each household should bring their own food cutlery and crockery in wales you can eat while out on a walk run or cycle but first minister mark drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an excuse for garden parties people with certain underlying health conditions or who are pregnant or aged over 70 are deemed to be clinically vulnerable if you are in this category you are advised to stay at home as much as possible another group of about 25 million people is categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable this group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face to face contact   so called shielding now those people in england and wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again   either with members of their household or by meeting someone else at a social distance social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets   packed with the virus   into the air these can be breathed in or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on and then touch your face with unwashed hands virus transmission is less likely when fresh air is involved   usually when people are outside if you show symptoms of coronavirus   such as a dry cough high temperature or loss of taste   you must take extra precautions you should self isolate   stay at home and not leave it for any reason ask others to drop off food and medicines if englands nhs test and trace team contact you because youve been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus you must self isolate for up to 14 days   even if you feel fine the people you live with dont have to self isolate but must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing there are similar tracing systems in scotland wales and northern ireland antibodies test a medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity the test detects antibodies in the blood which are produced by the body to fight off the disease asymptomatic someone who

bubble and other questions about coronavirus if you and your boyfriend both live alone and in england the good news is that from 13 june you can form a support bubble which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each other\u2019s company inside or outside a house you don\u2019t have to keep a 2m distance from one another and you can stay overnight at each other\u2019s house if you are living alone and your partner is in a shared household or vice versa matters get complicated you can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household what this means is that if one of your boyfriend\u2019s housemates has a partner who is   like you   living elsewhere and alone that couple will be prevented from meeting up support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone or alone with children if both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other you cannot form a support bubble with your boyfriend if he lives in scotland or wales although northern ireland has announced that it is also introducing support bubbles from 13 june as a single grandparent you will have the right to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d with your grandson and his family under the government\u2019s new guidance from 13 june your grandson would be able to stay at your home including overnight and would not need to keep a 2m distance however the complicating factor here is your lodger are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other and are you using separate rooms and facilities if the answer is yes then there should be no problem on the other hand if you have been using the same kitchen living room and bathroom and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger then you are both effectively part of the same household and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble there is no current date for reopening tattoo parlours in the uk and the tattoo and piercing industry union tpiu says it has not received any guidance from the government on when this might happen in the official guidance on which businesses must stay closed for the present tattoo parlours are listed in the category of personal care alongside hairdressers barbers and beauty and nail salons under the plans for easing lockdown 4 july is the earliest date on which personal care outlets could be allowed to reopen in england there is no set date in scotland wales or northern ireland extra hygiene measures are certain to be put in place as a condition of reopening   the tpiu says these are likely to include \u201cmasks for everyone visors goggles for artists and paying more attention to more thorough cleaning between customers and regularly throughout the day\u201d caravan parks were told to close at the end of march along with hotels b&bs and other types of holiday accommodation although some aspects of the lockdowns people are still not supposed to stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose the only exception to this rule is for people for whom a static caravan is their home the government has said it wants to get england\u2019s tourism sector running again from 4 july onwards \u201cas long as it is safe to do so\u201d but has not released any details of how this will happen however culture secretary oliver dowden told mps that self contained accommodation had a lower risk than other areas and said i would hope that that will be at the front of the queue the situation is clearer in northern ireland where static caravans will be open for business  from 20 july onwards in scotland the tourism industry has been given a conditional date of 15 july for reopening caravan parks are currently set to stay closed in wales until 26 september although the welsh government is reviewing the situation every three weeks coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in china in december 2019 its more precise name is covid 19 there are actually hundreds of coronaviruses   most of which circulate among animals including pigs camels bats and cats but there are a few   such as covid 19   that infect humans some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses such as the common cold covid 19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia most infected people will have only mild symptoms   perhaps a fever aching limbs a cough and loss of taste or smell   and will recover without special treatment but some older people and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease diabetes or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell the nhs has more about symptoms when people recover from an infection their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again this immunity is not always long lasting or totally efficient however and can decrease over time it is unclear though if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again university of oxford\u2019s prof sarah gilbert who is working on creating a vaccine for covid 19 says that it \u201cprobably is likely\u201d that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future the uk government views antibody tests   which can show if a person has had covid 19   as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work but the world health organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection scientists have said that the \u201cincubation period\u201d   the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms   is five days on average however some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this the world health organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days but some researchers say it may be up to 24 days knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important it allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus both viruses are highly contagious on average its thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people while those with flu pass it on to about one other person there are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus if you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self isolate in quarantine you will not automatically qualify for statutory sick pay ssp so its possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home for four out of five people covid 19 will be a mild disease a bit like flu symptoms include fever a dry cough or loss of smell and tastehttps  wwwbbccouk news health 51048366 if the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia about one in seven people may need hospital treatment recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place some people will shrug off the illness quickly but for others the path to full health could take months and leave lasting problems this is the subject of ongoing research but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many silent spreaders there are   ranging from 5% to 80% of cases that was the conclusion of an analysis by prof carl heneghan of the university of oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects the upshot they said was that there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics and they said that if the screening for covid 19 is only carried out on people with symptoms   which has been the main focus of uk testing policy   then cases will be missed perhaps a lot of cases some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many silent carriers there may be diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home however some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors such as heart disease or obesity as well as diabetes   which put them at much higher risk of complications a third of virus deaths in england from 1 march to 11 may were linked to diabetes but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 insulin dependent or type 2 diabetes is still very low age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus say experts diabetes uk advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible as well as following social distancing measures dental practices in england have been told they can reopen on 8 june as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place these include limiting use of waiting areas screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers such as a plastic shield in reception areas currently if a patient is in considerable pain dentists can refer them to an urgent dental care udc hub these centres have been created across the uk to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements if a udc centre is not available in your area there may be other options some hospitals for example offer emergency dental walk in services but you should always speak to your local dentist first   or use the nhs 111 online service if you\u2019re not registered with one asthma uks advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler usually brown as prescribed this will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus including coronavirus carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up if your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus contact the online nhs 111 coronavirus service coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses or diabetes there is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy   and who dont for instance have respiratory problems   are at greater risk from coronavirus covid 19 can in a small number of cases lead to pneumonia most notably in people with pre existing lung conditions but as this is a new virus no one will have any immunity to it whether they have previously had pneumonia or any other form of coronavirus such as sars wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public it presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip reading to communicate but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus especially if in a hospital setting the charity action on hearing loss says there are some clinically approved see through covered face masks that help enable lip reading however they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus and wouldn\u2019t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic they say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate there are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help yes according to the advice from public health england a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine the important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose \u2013 and that you can breathe easily whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures so wash your hands or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off and don\u2019t touch your eyes nose or mouth at all wash the face coverings after each time you use them for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care such as wool or silk and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained there is no vaccine for this new virus as there is for flu which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects if you\u2019re living with someone who\u2019s self isolating you should keep all contact to a minimum and if possible not be in the same room together the person self isolating should stay in a well ventilated room with a window that can be opened and keep away from other people in the house if you live with someone who has symptoms youll also need to self isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started   this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear if you get symptoms self isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start even if it means youre self isolating for longer than 14 days if you do not get symptoms you can stop self isolating after 14 days the current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely wherever possible however those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period should talk to their gp or clinician this is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed if you live with your partner they count as being part of your household if neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact having sex wont increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another if one person does have symptoms they should be self isolating in a separate room using contraception such as condoms wont alter your risk of catching the virus as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway if you are going to touch each others genitals its likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time   and we know the virus is passed through saliva dr alex george told the bbcs newsbeat essentially any possibility of transfer of coronavirus   from your mouth to your hands to genitals to someone elses nose or mouth   increases the risk of passing on coronavirus it\u2019s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown because until recently there has been very little testing of the population as a whole it was mostly just those in hospital and some nhs and care staff who were being tested there is also a lag effect with the figures it takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases hospitalisations and then deaths   around three weeks at least   so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are it\u2019s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown but police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up what we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early april and the rate of infection has dropped significantly there\u2019s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised or dying from the virus where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the uk\u2019s care homes latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in england and wales   and nearly half of those in scotland and northern ireland   take place there following a drop in hospital patients with covid 19 the nhs has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in england urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted but gps will continue to use online consultations and regular testing will be offered to all staff the nhs says the pressure on many staff will remain unprecedented and employers must keep them safe routine elective surgery will be restarted with priority given to long waiters and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to \u201cpre covid 19 levels\u201d discussions are taking place in wales and northern ireland on how to resume normal nhs services scotlands health secretary has announced that nhs services will be gradually restarted without committing to any dates the simple answer is that we simply don\u2019t know people who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the nhs in march and told not to go out for 12 weeks these are people with specific medical conditions the government is now advising these people   more than one million around the uk   to shield until the end of june vulnerable people in england and wales have been advised that from the beginning of june they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing shielding advice in northern ireland and scotland has not yet changed if you are concerned about whether a call text or email is genuine you can check the nhs england test and trace service website or the scottish government test and protect website or the public health agency website in northern ireland genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial

don\u2019t want to talk over the phone in england you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web based service instead pregnant women are being advised by the uk government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum however they should attend antenatal clinics as normal there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus but for a small number of women being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection the government\u2019s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general\u201d mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk if your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection these would be passed on through breastfeeding breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk   cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently while trying to avoid touching your eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands this is highly unlikely to happen according to scientists and vets while there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals it is possible that a pets fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal but even without the threat of coronavirus you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead and avoid touching your nose and mouth in general children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus according to data from china and other countries this may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold however children with underlying lung problems such as asthma may have to be more careful all schools in the uk are currently closed except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers you can walk your dog as much as you like the government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want and can spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household there is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead but the royal parks for instance urge visitors to do this to help ensure people practise social distancing the government has said people in england can exercise outside as many times a day as they want they can also spend time outside not exercising as long as they remain 2m 6ft away from anyone outside their household the welsh and scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day you still cant use playgrounds outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces in england you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance as long as you follow social distancing while you are there however in scotland and wales people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside in northern ireland there are no restrictions on travel for those who are not self isolating yes it is government guidance on staying at home says where parents do not live in the same household children under 18 can be moved between their parents homes if neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self isolating children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them however the family division of the high court has said that in england and wales if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice they may vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe even if the other parent does not agree where this is the case family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone it depends on a number of factors typical business trips to germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out essential functions such as healthcare a certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case with the introduction of quarantine restrictions at uk borders from 8 june returning to the uk will not as straightforward anyone entering the uk from that point will need to self isolate for 14 days after arrival there are a number of exemptions to this rule including uk residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work driving tests were suspended in england scotland and wales for three months from 20 march so unless it was booked for a date after 20 june the test will not take place as planned a similar situation is in place in northern ireland a new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the driver and vehicles standards agency dvsa you cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself you can still apply for an emergency driving test if you\u2019re classed as a critical worker in scotland wales and northern ireland taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed as it is not counted as an essential journey the department for transport has indicated that this is also still the case in england despite the recent lockdown changes however the aa says it\u2019s not clear whether this would be the case if for example a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping people affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months it is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed will be added to the mortgage balance this means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre payment meter so you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you you could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up the government says that if its urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account you should be able to top up online as well and you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you so you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this if your flight is cancelled you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline ryanair for example says customers who want a cash refund will receive it in due course as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual with fewer staff many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re booking instead if the airline later folds the voucher will probably become invalid and any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance if you\u2019re self employed you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of \u00a32500 per month if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic and you meet certain conditions you must have been self employed since at least the start of april 2019 and have a trading profit of less than \u00a350000 a year on average initially this was a one off payment designed to cover march april and may up to a maximum total of \u00a37500 in august applications will open for a second and final payment covering 70% of profits up to a cap of \u00a32190 a month for another three months \u00a36570 in total the scheme   which is called the coronavirus self employment income support scheme   is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self employment the government has said that everyone should work from home if possible and only go into a workplace if their job absolutely cannot be done from home your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety if you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus you could argue that you have a right not to come into work if you still do not want to go in you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave but your employer does not have to agree to this an employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason self employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self isolate may apply for two benefits   universal credit or employment and support allowance normally you would be eligible after four days of being ill however the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay ssp from the first day off but charities are worried that there is still a five week delay before universal credit is paid anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the uk and are on a low income or out of work students in full time education aren\u2019t usually eligible for universal credit but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit people aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support are responsible for a child caring for a disabled person or cannot work you can use the governments benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to the government advises that people who are self isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal if they can\u2019t work from home employers must ensure any self isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer employees in self isolation are entitled to statutory sick pay for every day they are in isolation worth \u00a39585 per week as long as they qualify however employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish the government says that this plan is still on course at the beginning of lockdown the government promised to provide laptops and tablets for disadvantaged children and young people so that they would not fall behind in online learning organised by their schools education secretary gavin williamson told mps on the education select committee that 200000 laptops would be delivered some at the end of may but most of them in june on 9 june mr williamson told the house of commons that 100000 laptops had been distributed prioritising children who have social workers and that the government was on schedule to distribute all the computers over the coming month however he faced criticism from the opposition that the roll out was taking too long labour mp meg hillier said that it was \u201calready late for vulnerable pupils and with no clear plan about catch up\u201d separate schemes to provide vulnerable children and adults with laptops have been announced in northern ireland wales and scotland although the government has changed its advice on the use of face coverings in public places it still recommends that face masks or face coverings should not be worn in schools it adds that face coverings should not be worn in any circumstances by those who are not able to handle them properly for example small children or those with special educational needs or disabilities as they may \u201cinadvertently increase the risk of transmission\u201d trish greenhalgh professor of primary care health sciences at the university of oxford told the times educational supplement that face coverings could also have a bad effect on the mental health of some children \u201cif compulsory masking is going to tip some kids into a bad space after weeks of stressful lockdown we need to balance that risk with the potential benefits\u201d meanwhile other countries have taken different approaches when reopening schools in france for example face masks are compulsory for teachers and pupils aged 11 and over but they are not worn in denmark there are no current plans to open schools for most pupils during the summer holidays but the situation varies across the uk in england some nursery reception year 1 and year 6 children have gone back but the government has dropped plans for all primary school pupils to return before the summer similarly some year 10 and year 12 students in england will go back from 15 june but the government has confirmed that secondary schools may not fully reopen until september at the earliest schools in wales will reopen from 29 june for all age groups but only a third of pupils will be in class at any one time the summer term has been extended by a week to 27 july and the autumn half term holiday will be stretched to two weeks schools in scotland and northern ireland won\u2019t be returning until after the summer holidays in august across the uk some vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have been in school throughout the crisis including during the easter holidays but it is not yet clear whether that provision will continue over the summer break playgrounds are still closed in england the next review of lockdown easing is due towards the end of the month so changes may be considered then in scotland playgrounds are set to reopen from 18 june when the country moves into phase two of its lockdown easing plans there is no date yet for reopening in wales while there is no detail on this in northern ireland\u2019s recovery plan   but decisions will be delegated to councils as they are responsible for playgrounds ultimately this is a personal decision but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now a recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally university campuses have been closed this term by the covid 19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn the university of cambridge has said it will have no face to face lectures in the next academic year and the university of manchester has said that to begin with its lectures will be taking place online only other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year before you make a firm choice the higher education watchdog office for students says your university should give you \u201cabsolute clarity\u201d on whether courses will be online on campus or a mixture and if the information isnt available next month it must be provided before clearing in august once you have all the information you need to weigh up whats important to you bear in mind the universities minister says youll have to pay full fees even if youre learning online   but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses also if your university can offer a campus experience access to facilities like libraries bars  and cafes is likely to be limited   so student life could be very different to normal the department for education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back in a statement it said that if universities are \u201cunable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms\u201d to claim a refund students first need to complain directly to their university if that is unsuccessful then students in england or wales can lodge an appeal with the office of the independent adjudicator oia if your university is in scotland then it\u2019s the spso scottish public services ombudsman and for northern ireland you go to the nipso northern ireland public services ombudsman  students will need a \u201ccompletions procedure form\u201d from their university in order to file an appeal most students have gone home to self isolate leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent if you\u2019re worried about paying rent for an empty student property first of all check your tenancy agreement some contracts will have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice if you don\u2019t have a \u201cbreak clause\u201d you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a \u201creduced payment plan\u201d this could mean you pay less rent each month the ministry of justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits it says the measures are temporary and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point taking into account public health advice prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in march since then relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates or sending an email to the prison which is then printed out and passed on as a temporary measure secure phone handsets have been given to pre approved prisoners at 55 prisons allowing them to speak to a small number of pre authorised contacts video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions the earliest point at which places of worship could open is early july when the prime minister says some public places could reopen \u201cprovided they are safe and enforce social distancing\u201d however several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon ibrahim mogra a senior imam in leicester told the bbc that mosques present particular problems we are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship he said so we are talking about really large numbers of people the church of england says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year although the approach would vary on a regional basis the rt rev sarah mullally who\u2019s leading the church\u2019s plans for reopening says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books distancing within the church buildings and holy communion research conducted by the resolution foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600000 this year if you\u2019re worried about finding a job you can head to the national careers service for advice on how to find job vacancies you can also search online for virtual job fairs this could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your cv and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job people experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test you can either do this via the nhs website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in england wales and northern ireland or 0800 028 2816 in scotland if you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message email or phone the only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app that has not yet been launched in england outside the isle of wight when it is it will provide extra information for contact tracers but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online you will only be asked to report contacts known to you especially anyone in your household people with whom you\u2019ve been in close physical contact less than 1m 3ft or have been within 2m 6ft of for more than 15 minutes the governments contact tracing app is not yet up and running when it becomes widely available it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you\u2019ve shared a bus or train carriage no the tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive close contact means being less than 1m 3ft from somebody at any point or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes you shouldnt be that close to a delivery driver there is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry the short answer to this is no its true that you don\u2019t have to go into quarantine if you\u2019re returning to the uk from what\u2019s known as the common travel area cta   ireland isle of man and the channel islands when the government first announced its plans there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the cta and then on to the uk and so avoid having to self isolate however this loophole termed by some the dublin dodge has now been closed by the government travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the cta for 14 days or more you will have to show proof of when you entered the cta and how long you have spent there   such as a boarding pass or itinerary   when you enter the uk key workers will not necessarily be exempt the government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules among others it includes road haulage and freight workers medical and care professionals providing essential health care some seasonal agricultural workers eurostar and eurotunnel employees pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways it also depends where you are going in the uk   some employees will be exempt from quarantine in england and wales but not scotland the government guidance details what you\u2019ll need to show when you enter the uk to prove you are exempt this differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address the name of your employer and what work you\u2019ll be doing unless your flatmates were travelling with you they do not need to self isolate or quarantine with you however you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens bathrooms and sitting areas you should stay in a well ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened separate from your flatmates and if you can you should use a separate bathroom from them if you do need to share these facilities regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house both for bathing and showering and for washing your hands not necessarily if you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self isolate in quarantine you will not automatically qualify for statutory sick pay ssp so its possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave or else as unpaid leave the department of work and pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self isolate on their return it adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions meanwhile the foreign & commonwealth office is still advising uk nationals against taking all but essential international travel what questions

        "text": "on monday non essential shops in england will be allowed to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed this includes retailers offering clothes toys books furniture and electronics for many people stuck indoors for weeks it will be a welcome change of scene but with hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the uk shopping will not be like it was before 23 march here are five ways it will be different from next week weve all seen the 2m markings and arrows on the floor in supermarkets showing customers how far apart they need to stay and which way to walk and this will now be the case in other non essential stores too people will also be asked to keep a set distance between each other on escalators at john lewis for example shoppers will be required to stand eight steps behind each other and only one person at a time will be allowed to use a lift at the department store unless they are from the same household at primark two people can use a lift but only if they stand on designated spots there will be hand sanitising stations throughout shops and people will be encouraged to use hand gel when they enter a shop shop assistants will look different as well at next employees will wear a protective visor and have the option of wearing an additional mouth and nose mask many retailers are also fitting plastic screens at tills and there will be a lot more cleaning going on   of shopping baskets door handles counters and escalator rails selfridges is one of the few retailers that will allow people to try clothes on but each fitting room will be sanitised by steaming and antibacterial cleaning after each customer use government guidelines recommend people should shop alone where possible so hopes of hitting the stores with friends will have to wait some retailers such as primark will allow a group of people into their shops from monday but they must be from the same household they will also have to follow social distancing rules once they are inside the branch dan simms co head of the uk retail agency team at colliers international reckons the younger demographic will take advantage of the lifting of restrictions to socialise and visit retail destinations but that is not expected to happen immediately from monday as at the moment six people from different households are only allowed to meet outside and some shopping malls such as manchesters trafford centre and others owned by intu have removed indoor seating areas to support social distancing and to discourage people from gathering meanwhile stopping for a coffee with a friend or sitting down for a bite to eat will be limited because some stores will not reopen their in house cafes or restaurants the british retail consortiums guidance is that customers should be discouraged from handling products that theyre not going to buy but the policy very much varies from retailer to retailer at selfridges shoppers can try on shoes and the footwear will be sanitised afterwards kurt geiger will also allow people to try on shoes   provided they use anti bacterial hand gel first as well as a pop sock   but then the footwear will be placed in quarantine for 12 hours but at h&m people will not be allowed to try on footwear at all it is the same for clothing at next for example customers can handle clothes but at selfridges shoppers will be asked not to touch items unless they intend to buy them if they do the garment will be quarantined for 72 hours this is based on government guidance that the risk of infection from coronavirus on a surface is likely to be reduced significantly after a three day period the majority of retailers will close their changing rooms and goods returned will be quarantined for 72 hours some shops will also offer contactless returns at primark customers will present the item they want to return to a staff member at a till complete with their receipt which will be scanned people will receive their refund and take their item to a returns section where it will be held for 72 hours before going back on the shop floor at waterstones that three day rule will also apply to books that customers browse through in store which will allow them to self heal according to chief executive james daunt perhaps unsurprisingly people will not be allowed to handle makeup or sniff a perfume bottle but picking things up in a shop might be a hard habit to break for some says consumer psychologist kate nightingale there will be this almost automatic behaviour of your muscles where you want to touch something she says but then youre in the middle of the flow of your hand to the counter and you will remind yourself no i cant and this can create other problems conventional wisdom suggests everyone will be delighted to get out of the house and treat themselves to a days shopping from monday not quite says ms nightingale restrictions in shops such as not touching items or being told which direction to walk in is likely to frustrate people already experiencing anxiety since lockdown was enforced on 23 march we are basically living in a constant state of fear and anxiety   dont leave the house dont touch anyone dont do exactly what you were doing before   this is not a normal way of human behaviour says ms nightingale that means people will be going back to shops after more than three months with a pre existing huge ball of negativity in our head whether we want it or not even the smallest things can cause grumpiness at hmv which has already reopened stores in canada and the us shoppers are asked to sanitise their hands before handling any merchandise there are confrontations in stores about it doug putman the owner of hmv told the bbc for some customers they are very comfortable for others they are a little less comfortable and i think it just comes down to your personality type on the whole though he expects people will do their bit what youve got is an overall public sentiment that even if you dont believe that you should have to sanitise and this and that youre going to do it because it is the right thing much like supermarkets retailers will ask shoppers to queue to prevent overcrowding in stores and allow people to maintain 2m social distancing to relieve the tedium some department store selfridges will employ djs to help make it a more joyful experience it may also take longer to pay for your shopping as some retailers will close every other cashier to prevent people being in close proximity to each other people may also have to wait for their favourite shop to even open in the first place while retailers like primark will open 153 stores in england on monday john lewis is initially only reopening two sites at poole and kingston upon thames it intends to reopen 11 more stores the following week stores are being chosen on the proviso they are easily accessible by car therefore reducing the reliance on public transport for partners and customers"

brazilian president jair bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the risks of the virus and prioritised the economy in his decision making even criticising state governors for introducing regional

implemented now under the new rules most travellers entering the uk by land air or sea must complete an online form in the 48 hours before they arrive stating where they will be staying in the uk while self isolating and how they can be contacted they could be fined \u00a3100 for not filling in the form while there is a fine of up to \u00a31000 in england for those who are found to be not

says that if someone arrives without a place to stay then they will have to book accommodation at their own expense at a list of hotels provided using its bookings system one reason people can put

guidance for border officials seen by the bbc indicates that unless the port of entry is particularly quiet it is likely only spot checks will be used to see if passengers have filled out the forms

for example if they need to buy essential supplies and have no one to do this for them home secretary priti patel says the decision to bring in a travel quarantine system now is guided by science as uk transmission or the spread of the virus is low enough for imported cases to potentially cause a devastating second wave prof john aston the home offices chief scientific adviser says the scientific

transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere he says however some have questioned the decision to bring in quarantine measures now when the uk has a higher transmission rate than many other countries conservative mp sir liam fox said in the house of commons last week if such a barrier was required why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak and if it is a contingency measure against a so called second wave why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have mark woolhouse professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the university of edinburgh suggests bringing in the policy would have had some effect during the containment phase of the virus response back in february but he argues that bringing it in now wont have any measurable impact on public health whatsoever in late february and early march the government did advise passengers from affected areas such as wuhan in china and parts of italy to self isolate when arriving in the uk but this policy was dropped on 13 march sir patrick vallance the governments chief scientific adviser said at the governments coronavirus press conference that measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low and applied to countries with higher rates there was some confusion over whether these travel quarantine rules would apply to the whole of the uk because border security is a centralised measure while health is devolved   meaning england scotland wales and northern ireland set their own rules ultimately the measure was brought in as part of the public health act so when the uk government decided to introduce quarantine rules on 3 june they were for england only all home nations have now made it a requirement for travellers from abroad to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the uk but they could choose to end the policy at different times or to vary the rules for example workers providing essential healthcare will have to quarantine upon arrival in scotland but not in england wales or northern ireland the level of fines issued for breaking the rules also vary in scotland if someone fails to self isolate for 14 days at a fixed address they will be fined \u00a3480 while in england wales and northern ireland its \u00a31000 in england an individual will be fined \u00a3100 for not filling out the contact locator form correctly in the rest of the uk the fine is \u00a360 falling to \u00a330 if paid promptly there has been a lot of discussion about so called air bridges which could allow visitors from countries with low coronavirus transmission rates to enter the uk without having to self isolate for an air bridge to open two countries would have to agree to relax quarantine restrictions so far portugal is the only country offering to open an air bridge to the uk sources close to the government have told the bbc that the department for transport is keen to open air bridges by the end of the month quash the quarantine a lobbying group of

death toll in europe and the third highest in the world after the us and brazil however the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons on sunday the government announced a further 36 deaths   the lowest number since 22 march the day before the uk went into lockdown the majority of the uks deaths have been in england with more than 37000 so far   about 90% of the total for the uk in scotland the official government figure for deaths is 2448 but data on death registrations from the national records of scotland nrs suggests it had reached nearly 4000 by 7 june in wales the death toll stands at 1444 while there have been 541 deaths in northern ireland last weeks figures from the ons show the overall death total in the uk for the week to 29 may fell again nearing the normal range for the time of year the most deprived parts of england and wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas according to the ons urban areas were worse affected than rural areas and london had significantly more deaths from coronavirus per 100000 people than any other region research by public health england phe has found that people from ethnic minorities have a much higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white british ethnicity but it is still not clear why   the study did take into account occupations or obesity which are also known to be high risk factors most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly with nhs england figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80 the r number is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to if r is below one then the number of people contracting the disease will fall if it is above one the number will grow the scientific advisory group for emergencies known as sage believes the r number across the whole of the uk is currently between 07 and 09 the government says the r number is between 08 and 10 in most english regions   but between 08 and 11 in the south west the estimate for scotland is between 06 and 08 in northern ireland it is between 05 and 09 while it is between 07 and 10 in wales the government has said that the r number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased the number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in april and the seven day rolling average shows a clear downward trend a further 1514 cases were announced on sunday estimates by the ons however suggest there could be nearly 6000 cases per day in england alone   not including cases in hospitals or care homes   where people either show no symptoms or have mild symptoms and are not tested for the virus chief scientific advisor patrick vallance has said the epidemic is shrinking but not fast suggesting this means moving very carefully out of lockdown cases were originally concentrated in london the midlands and the north west but wales and parts of scotland and the north east of england have also seen a high proportions of cases health secretary matt hancock has raised the possibility that there could be local lockdowns in the future to control the spread of the virus the number of people in hospital with covid 19 has been gradually declining since a peak over easter on friday the government said the number of people in hospital with coronavirus had fallen to 5607  down from 7036 at the same time last week however the picture is different across the uks nations and regions with numbers falling faster in some areas than others the uk exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200000 a day by the end of may however the uk statistics authority has criticised how the data has been presented saying the aim appeared to be to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding health secretary matt hancock said he would look at ways the information could be improved the government announced there were 144865 tests processed or posted in the 24 hours to 0900 on sunday this figure does not represent the number of people tested as some are tested more than once at least two million people have been tested for coronavirus in the uk   but the government has been unable to provide an updated figure for that since 22 may more than 31000 people were identified as close contacts of people who tested positive for coronavirus during the first week of the test and trace system in england of those 85% were reached by the test and trace teams and asked to self isolate for 14 days"

        "text": "as lockdowns ease thermal imaging cameras are popping up in all sorts of public places to assess the state of peoples health using infrared technology thermal cameras detect radiating heat from a body   usually from the forehead   and then estimate core body temperature these cameras are an extremely powerful tool often deployed by fire fighters to track smouldering embers and police to search for out of sight suspects but they are not designed to be medical devices so how useful are they in the current pandemic they can give a reasonable measure of skin temperature to within half a degree   but thats not the same as body temperature these devices in general are less accurate than medical device thermometers like those you stick in the ear says derek hill professor of medical imaging science from university college london about 37c 986f a high temperature is usually considered to be 38c or over but normal temperature can vary from person to person and change during the day it can also fluctuate during a womans monthly cycle taking an accurate reading of core body temperature isnt easy although it can be measured on the forehead in the mouth the ear and the armpit the most accurate way is to take a rectal reading  37\u00b0c986\u00b0f normal body temperature 38\u00b0c1004\u00b0f or above high temperature fever no they only measure temperature a high temperature or fever is just one common symptom of the virus others include nausea headaches fatigue and loss of taste or smell but not everyone with the virus gets a high temperature and not everyone with a high temperature is infected with coronavirus so thermal cameras alone will miss infected people with other symptoms or no symptoms at all   known as false negatives they will also identify people unwell with a fever for another reason   known as false positives on its own temperature screening may not be very effective says the world health organization cameras have to be set up correctly and take account of ambient temperature a risk is that cameras can lull operators into a false sense of security they are\u2026 only one tool among many says james ferryman professor of computational vision from the university of reading heat radiating from the skin will likely be impacted by wearing face masks says prof ferryman thats why most temperature measurements are based on the forehead which is usually exposed not necessarily skin temperature actually goes down during exercise as sweat appears on the surface of the skin the body is pretty good at regulating its temperature even after exercise so it would have to be really quite high to show up with portable thermometers pointed at foreheads they dont need to touch the skin but do need to be within a few centimetres of it while accurate to a fraction of a degree on skin temperature they correctly detect fever about 90% of the time compared with a rectal thermometer prof hill says thermal scanners are now in place at some uk airports   including bournemouth temperature screening is being trialled for some passengers at heathrow while manchester airport says equipment is also being tested   but results will not be communicated to passengers or used to influence whether a customer can travel portsmouth international ferry port has also installed a thermal scanner to screen departing passengers schools are deploying hand held laser thermometers to check children each morning and some employers are looking at introducing staff testing in workplaces under uk employment law individuals must agree before an employer can temperature screen members of staff some work contracts will already allow for this type of test to be carried out by so called implied consent if employees do not consent   and there is no pre agreed policy covering the situation   then taking someones temperature is unlawful says the professional body for hr and people development employers

able to get an ice cream at the seaside   and some restaurants and bars are doing takeaway food and drink   but hotels remain closed to all guests except for a small number of specific groups government advice in england says businesses providing holiday accommodation   including hotels campsites caravan parks and short term lets   should stay closed for leisure related trips no person should stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose it adds the culture secretary oliver dowden says hes keen get the tourism sector going as rapidly as possible with the government sticking to what it describes as an ambitious target to get englands tourism sector back by 4 july   as long as it is safe to do so self contained accommodation has a lower risk than other areas mr dowden told the commons i would hope that that will be at the front of the queue hotels in northern ireland already have a confirmed date for reopening   monday 20 july zoos and animal parks are shut as are many national parks facilities such as car parks and toilets may not be open either people are also being urged not to rush to beauty spots such as the lake district visit cornwall says that people should not travel to the area unless they can return home within 90 minutes in addition people who live in england cannot travel for recreation into wales scotland or northern ireland at the moment its difficult british nationals are still being urged not to take any non essential foreign travel this means you are unlikely to get travel insurance because insurers and airlines take their cue from the official advice but the airlines are hopeful for the summer season easyjet plans to resume some flights this month while ryanair and british airways plan to ramp up their services in july all tui and first choice holidays are cancelled until at least 11 june be prepared to self isolate at some destinations and   if you return to the uk from monday 8 june   you will have to quarantine for two weeks those returning from overseas will not be eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions   for example displaying coronavirus symptoms all visitors and returning uk nationals arriving by plane ferry or train will face fines if they break the rules certain groups are exempt uk aviation bosses are hoping a large number of so called air bridges will be in place by 29 june when the uk travel quarantine measures are set to be reviewed these would exempt travellers from quarantine if they move between countries with low virus levels the eu has insisted there will be a summer season this year the european commission has proposed a gradual lifting of travel restrictions throughout the eu seasonal workers and citizens of countries with similar levels of infections could start to travel more freely first again its impossible to say at this stage travel advice will need to have been updated but it depends on the diseases progress remember holidays and flights booked against foreign office travel advice are unlikely to be covered by travel insurance if you end up not able to travel if your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled then you are are entitled to a full cash refund however lots of people have been struggling to get their money back and have been offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead if you are offered a voucher or a free rebooking instead of cash you can accept or refuse it but if the airline later folds the voucher may no longer be valid if your airline or holiday company hasnt cancelled

        "text": "everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling coronavirus compared with others but you have to make sure youre comparing the same things the united states for example has far more covid 19 deaths than any other country   as of 18 may a total of more than 90000 deaths but the us has a population of 330 million people if you take the five largest countries in western europe   the uk germany france italy and spain   their combined population is roughly 320 million and the total number of registered coronavirus deaths from those five countries as of 18 may was more than 130000   nearly 50% higher than that of the us the number of deaths is rising faster in the us but individual statistics dont tell the full story for comparisons to be useful says rowland kao professor of data science at the university of edinburgh there are two broad issues to consider does the underlying data mean the same thing and does it make sense to compare two sets of numbers if the epidemiology all the other factors surrounding the spread of the disease is different on the bbcs andrew marr show on 10 may prof sir david spiegelhalter from cambridge university said that trying to rank different countries to decide which was the worst in europe was a completely fatuous exercise but he referred to the bad countries in europe uk belgium france spain italy and said clearly its important to note that group is way above in terms of their mortality a group like germany austria portugal denmark norway who have low fatality rates so why is it so difficult to compare individual countries first of all there are differences in how countries record covid 19 deaths france and germany for example have been including deaths in care homes in the headline numbers they produce every day but the daily figures for england referred only to deaths in hospitals until 29 april when they started factoring in deaths in care homes as well a further complication is that there is no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths or their causes does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics or are the suspicions of a doctor enough germany counts deaths in care homes only if people have tested positive for the virus belgium on the other hand includes any death in which a doctor suspects coronavirus was involved the uks daily figures only count deaths when somebody has tested positive for the virus but its weekly figures include suspected cases also does the virus need to be the main cause of death or does any mention on a death certificate count are you really comparing like with like there is a lot of focus on death rates but there are different ways of measuring them too one is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases   of all the people who test positive for coronavirus how many go on to die but different countries are testing in different ways early in the outbreak the uk mainly tested people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital that can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country with a wider testing programme the more testing a country carries out the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms or perhaps no symptoms at all so the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a countrys population   the numbers of deaths per million people for example but that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached if a countrys first case was early in the global outbreak then it has had longer for its death toll to grow the uk government compares how each country has done since recording its 50th death but even that poses some problems a country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and reduce the eventual death toll when studying these comparisons it is also worth remembering that most people who get infected with coronavirus will recover it is more difficult to have confidence in data which comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like china or iran accurate we dont really know calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population chinas figures are extraordinarily low even after it revised upwards the death toll in wuhan by 50% so can we really trust the data there are real differences in the populations in different countries demographics are particularly important   thats things like average age or where people live comparisons have been made between the uk and the republic of ireland but they are problematic ireland has a much lower population density and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas it makes more sense to compare dublin city and county with an urban area in the uk of about the same size like merseyside than to try to compare the two countries as a whole similarly a better though still imperfect comparison for london europes major global city may be with new york the biggest global hub in the united states you also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure a comparison of death rates between countries in europe and africa wouldnt necessarily work because countries in africa tend to have much younger populations we know that older people are much more likely to die of covid 19 on the other hand most european countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most african countries and that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic but they are not all the same do people actively seek treatment how easy is it to get to hospitals do you have to pay to be treated well all of these things vary from place to place says prof andy tatem of the university of southampton another big factor is the level of comorbidity   this means the number of other conditions such as diabetes heart disease or high blood pressure   which people may already have when they get infected countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far both germany and south korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries the number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates but not all testing data is the same   some countries record the number of people tested while others record the total number of tests carried out many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result the timing of testing and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community also need to be taken into account germany and south korea tested aggressively very early on and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading but italy which has also done a lot of tests has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths  italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold the uk is doing the same thing so is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons what you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another and what you can learn from that says prof jason oke from the university of oxford and testing seems to be the most obvious example so far but until this outbreak is over it wont be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better thats when we can really learn the lessons for next time says prof oke this piece was first published on 21 april and has been updated to reflect the latest statistics what claims do you

        "text": "as the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus scientists have another target in their sights   the superspreading event when one person infects many others and there is a new number thats key to understanding why that happens during the pandemic there has been a focus on the reproduction or r number this is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to on average however not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people some may self isolate and infect nobody while others go about their life and infect many people this is where the k number is useful it measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects the smaller the k number is the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is this means more superspreaders each individually infecting higher numbers of people about 10 15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections according to an expert dr adam kucharski of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine lshtm says typically what happens is a lot of people dont give the infection to anyone and then theres a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five 10 20 people potentially infected and we saw that even quite early on with covid covid 19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies how infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person including but it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events if someone when theyre most transmissible happens to go to an all day meeting with a large number of people and then go out for dinner afterwards you may well see a superspreading event dr kucharski says if that person happened to have an evening at home it might not have generated any transmission scientists have been keeping track of clusters of covid 19 since the pandemic began dr gwen knight from lshtm says we found that many of the settings are what we expected so care settings   hospitals and care homes   unfortunately are coming up and also cruise ships which is something we know from other infectious diseases but she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places   meat processing plants choirs bars and gyms all of these involve being indoors in close contact with others for prolonged periods of time but dr knight says there is another common thread these settings are likely to be loud settings and obviously that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do she says there is the hypothesis that because its loud and youre expelling more or faster air it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky there were several clusters linked to fitness classes in south korea and more were linked to zumba classes than to pilates classes so it might be that youre engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper as opposed to a more gentle breathing for example dr muge cevik of the university of st andrews says not all activities not all environments have the same risk of infection so for example the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors outdoors generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by   but that would be lower risk we could say the transmission risk is negligible whereas if you spend a whole day together in a big group in a park and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact less than 2m 6ft the risk is lower than being indoors   but there is still risk hand washing social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential she says strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus but as infections decrease and the world opens up scientists say a more targeted approach is needed dr cevik says we need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact tracing focus but if we can avoid these superspreading events and the environments and activities associated with them you can decrease almost 80% of infections and thats huge follow rebecca on twitter"

        "text": "lockdown is starting to ease across the uk we can meet more people while in england some children are back in school and car showrooms and open air markets have reopened but some scientists even those advising government have been in mutinous mood   saying ministers are acting too soon and the lifting of restrictions has been described as a dangerous moment even by englands deputy chief medical officer things are far better than when lockdown came in there were an estimated 100000 new infections every day in england on 23 march the day when boris johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives that compares with around 8000 daily infections at the moment its somewhere in the range of 10 fold fewer but thats still considerable dr adam kurcharski from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine told the bbc the speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower the r number   the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto   was around three when lockdown came in that meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others now the r is around 07 09 meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others however a comparison by the university of oxford suggests the uk is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown and it is notable the governments own coronavirus alert system for england remains at level 4 rather than level 3 when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed the chief science adviser sir patrick vallance warns there is not a lot of room for manoeuvre and the data urges caution r is close to one   the tipping point where cases increase again and we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread the restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus but their precise impact is unknown uncertainty is a particular issue with schools the governments evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact there is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick throughout the pandemic the scientists and politicians have been following the same script but there is now a clear loud and public split between some of those advising government and those following the science more than a dozen sage committee members who advise government have spoken out saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down essentially were lifting the lid on a boiling pan and its just going to bubble over argued prof calum semple major deja vu feeling to mid march scientists incredibly concerned politicians ignoring this public doesnt want life disturbed end of twitter post  by @devisridhar there is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now   it may lock us into the current number of cases there are approximately 8000 infections a day if easing restrictions raises the r number close to one then we will continue to have around 8000 infections every day waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a second wave however that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer there is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the uk the aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected the strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus south korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39000 in the uk however there is a danger in expecting identical results the uk is not using gps tracking to ensure people do as they are told like south korea or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in hong kong speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the uk and an analysis of south koreas strategy by imperial college london suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections depending on how optimistic the number crunching the number of people that have been infected remains low so any immunity is also low that means there is the potential for a second wave but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react the plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens with a cautious piecemeal approach i think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high lets not call it a second wave lets call it a second bump said prof mark woolhouse from the university of edinburgh a sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely dr kucharski said i dont think well see a huge exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks it may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters it will be late summer or autumn or even winter depending on what happens it may be

        "text": "the government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 may its also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed   staff patients or those isolating at home the uk statistics authority chairman has written to the health secretary matt hancock saying the published official figures are far from complete and comprehensible the department of health and social care dhsc said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown and the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease but as the programme has expanded it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data people tested is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test on 22 may when the data for people was last published 140497 tests were carried out on 80297 people the gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result people with void or unclear results were sent a new test up to 19 may 8% of tests carried out at drive through and pop up testing sites were inconclusive the figure for home test kits was not provided there are also good clinical reasons to retest someone   to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms on top of this people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests but not the people tested figures the latest round of office for national statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 april 10 may involved 10705 participants together surveillance swab and antibody testing which are important but arent used to diagnose people individually accounted for almost 30000 of the just under 130000 tests carried out on 30 may all of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result the government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons so we cant tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people like health and care staff and care home residents are being tested regularly the dhsc was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted   as one person tested or many a spokesperson did refer to a small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test suggesting routine testing may be limited an imperial college london study by the same modelling group that has informed much of the governments response said in april that nhs staff should be tested weekly even if they didnt have symptoms this need for routine testing has been echoed by nhs providers the body representing hospital trusts and nadra ahmed chairwoman of the national care association which represents independent care providers said routine testing in care homes was just not happening on 28 april health secretary matt hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didnt have symptoms but ms ahmed described this as smoke and mirrors she said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents and were still waiting 14 days later some hadnt even been able to test their staff and residents once while others were struggling to get onto the portal the uk statistics authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out but not yet returned in the number of tests its chairman sir david norgrove accused the government of using the data to show the largest possible number of tests even at the expense of understanding although the dhsc reached its target of providing 100000 tests a day by the end of april it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned after setting the 100000 tests a day target the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested in fact when it came to the people tested figures home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab this may account for some of the gap but again we cant say how much this in itself appeared to be a source of confusion   even within the department guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the people tested figure but this note was later taken off the website a dhsc spokesperson said these tests were only counted as people tested at the point of being analysed in the lab and that the note was removed to avoid confusion follow rachel on twitter"

        "text": "the uk is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months under the new rules we asked doctor and tv presenter xand van tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible details of the rules vary across the uk so if you are living outside of england some of the advice below may not apply to you the first thing to do is think about who youre inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them   we are very differently vulnerable to this virus if youre inviting overweight men who are older they face a very different risk to young families with young children if youre inviting people whove had the virus thats very different again think about the invitation and think about who youre putting at risk if youre thinking of inviting a 70 year old overweight man i would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept if youre shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings if you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly brilliant if they cant and people are walking through the house it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask wash their hands when they get into the house and then go straight into the garden they shouldnt touch anything you need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible to maintain social distancing about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six person gathering if everyone is from different households which is massive if you had 12 two metre by two metre picnic blankets you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that youre two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby i dont expect everyones got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that were talking about you need to find some way of measuring you could get a two metre pole a bamboo cane a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with hold it and spin around in a circle   everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other in your garden you could mark two metres out with blankets chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people   no one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench when we talk about gardens i look at mine and its a very small space to have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible in terms of bringing your own cutlery its difficult everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk theyre prepared to accept if you think youve had coronavirus and or youre low risk meaning youre young youre slim youre female   those are the main variables   your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other peoples cutlery but of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill if you are a man whos older and overweight and dont think youve had the virus i would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw if youre in the park you might not be able to wash your hands so i would say bring hand gel wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby if youre having people in your garden you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe you could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off if youre hosting say to everyone were all going to wash our hands once an hour you could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says wash your hands there needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet you should flush with the seat down   a lot of people dont bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids once you flush then you need to wipe down the loo you need either disinfectant wipes in the loo or you need a spray with some disposable towels you also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so youre not re contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom you want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom all the surfaces need to be wiped down even then remember its not a risk free zone probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated   you are definitely taking a risk by doing this youre not allowed to hug people and thats the rule but in my experience if a small child wants a hug its virtually impossible to stop them for people with nieces nephews grandchildren godchildren or other important children in their lives who they havent been able to see for a long time if youre going to a picnic in their garden its going to be quite difficult to avoid contact i would say if you do end up having a hug at least dont grab the person and pull them into your face a proper full frontal hug is the most dangerous but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous the only safe advice though is not to hug you should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering you are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population we still have a high level of transmission in the uk alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when theyre drunk the other thing is the time limit if you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking thats wildly different to coming over and saying were going to sit two metres apart for an hour and well wear a mask on the way in anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer the virus either moves through the air or it moves through droplets coming out of peoples mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets i would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left this virus is unpredictable and dangerous   significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the uk we have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it"

        "text": "it was supposed to be a celebratory bodysurf a chance to train together again the night before the official start of the summer season but a month ago in the hague five gregarious athletic young surfers lost their lives in freak sea conditions on their first return to the water since coronavirus restrictions had forced them apart joost sander pim max and mathijs fell victim to a thick wall of metres high foam and rough seas the bodies of four were recovered within 24 hours then last week i watched as firefighters extended a ladder to recover 23 year old mathijss body from boulders beneath the lighthouse at the end of scheveningen pier gazing at the waves crashing on to the rocks  i shared the sense of disbelief that still perforates this coastal community the five were all experienced surfers and coaches their surf school said they had classes scheduled for the whole week and a final blog posted a few hours before their deaths showed they were itching to hit the waves the group had discussed the foam and considered going in at another point another surfer who survived told friends but both wind and current had changed rapidly an unusually strong north northeasterly and a suffocating avalanche of algae foam proved a treacherous combination suddenly these experienced responsible young surfers trained to save others were unable to save themselves you just hope the moment of frantic panic was over fast joosts childhood friend timo van de ven told me he still struggles to accept they wont be coming back dutch sea rescue service knrm said the strong wind and current made their operation a tricky job scheveningen is known as the surf capital of the netherlands its a popular destination that relies on storms near the coast to generate decent rideable waves i live a 10 minute cycle away from the spot where the surfers died year round we watch surfers dashing into the icy north sea propelled by the thrill of catching a wave they bob and dip on the horizon like seals in their sleek black and blue wetsuits the grief in the scheveningen community is unimaginable said johan remkes acting mayor of the hague people here understand better than anyone else that the sea gives and the sea takes away but the way so many young lives are now being broken down and so many families and groups of friends have been affected is uniquely cruel whats striking about the deaths of these experienced surfers is that they were doing something so normal in a stretch of sea they knew like the back of their hands friends congregated on the stone steps leading down to the beach a week after their deaths cafes closed by the coronavirus crisis played tunes to crowds of students surfers tried to console one other wrapped up in hoodies and each others embrace police on bikes circled respectfully from a distance allowing people to be together when they were meant to stand apart leaving friends to grieve and not worry about infection its helped to feel part of a wider grief going there and being among people who understand a friend of the group told me the five were not just socially active they were known across the community among all ages tributes alongside a sea of flowers outside the shore surf school offered a snapshot of the five who touched so many young lives five beer bottles stood alongside framed photos and notes like rip wild hearts a poem circulated on social media with the opening line the waves are silent witnesses on an even quieter beach it felt unusually still on the beach for days afterwards as if the shock had reverberated on the sand and disrupted the breezy atmosphere joost bakker 30 surf instructor joost was described by friends as a stereotypical surfer as a lifeguard he was well aware of the hazards he moved to the hague to be close to the sea converting a van to spend more time by the shore bakker coached autistic children and once organised a sponsored cycle ride from norway to gibraltar to raise money for a charity that supports people with cancer his friend timo van de ven knew him since they were 12 after the intense emotion of the first few weeks the finality is the hardest part he died doing something he loved the last photo shows him smiling from ear to ear getting ready in his wetsuit thats some consolation sander dikken 38 he was enthusiastic and competitive and loved to swim between the piers at scheveningen he too was a lifeguard and surf instructor and studied kinesiology the mechanics of body movement at the university of groningen that enhanced his teaching at health by the sea gezond aan zee where he worked alongside joost pim wuite 24 he was one of the younger surf coaches at gezond aan zee a condolence note shared by his hockey club speaks of a smiley sweet young man with boundless energy leadership skills and commitment to youth training cricket loving friends laid flowers on the beach and remembered how his parents would often provide lunch for the team he was meant to visit bali this year until flights were grounded by the coronavirus crisis max verheijen 22 the youngest of the five he was close to completing a degree in mechanical engineering in delft near the hague a snowboarder who switched to the sea max was described by his family as smart friendly and always ready to have fun his body was carried in a casket through the central dutch village of muiderberg where he grew up followed by pallbearers carrying his beloved surfboard decorated with a bouquet of white roses flags flew at half mast and some draped wetsuits over the flagpoles in memory of the boy who lived for the waves mathijs van dulst 23 he was a childrens hockey coach and referee and had been looking for someone to sublet his room in the house he shared with 14 others photos of his room show a cluster of snow and surf boards propped up in a corner of his bedroom a tribute on his hockey club page says he trained the younger kids and showed the older ones how to party we carry them forever in our hearts reads a tribute from their colleagues at their surf club our friends are gone you live on in our hearts the nature of their deaths has intensified the anguish and confusion that cuts beyond the surfing community what is hard to understand is how they were caught up in freak conditions when a short distance away other people continued riding the waves into the sunset the sea foam that led to their deaths comes from a type of algae called phaeocystis globosa scientists from the royal netherlands institute for sea research nioz have worked out what they think must have happened colonies of algae are held together by a mucous like matrix that protects the cells and allows them to rapidly increase in size the algae need sunlight and nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate and a sunny start to may helped the cells grow rapidly the sea foam off scheveningen was found to be four times the average peak seen in the past 10 years however cloudy weather the day before the tragedy triggered the disintegration of the algae colony into an unparalleled quantity of individual cells viral infections caused the cells to burst open and a force 7 wind and strong seas whipped them up into a large amount of foam the north northeasterly wind drove the foam against a harbour head before the currents changed and the foam moved towards the beach the scientists believe lifeguards and water sports enthusiasts need to be alerted to the potential risks of high levels of sea foam they say it will take time to establish a proper warning system for the future to prevent further accidents meanwhile five white fish have been painted on the rocks at scheveningen near the spot where joost sander pim max and mathijs were last seen alive"

        "text": "the pandemic has seen carbon dioxide co2 emissions fall as fossil fuel use has collapsed but will these changes be permanent from electricity giveaways to the virtual end of fracking the global lockdown has seen huge changes in the way we create and consume energy carbon emissions have dropped dramatically and the air is clearer over major cities as car traffic has disappeared but as demand for energy picks up once again there are some large unresolved questions about how we power our lives in the years to come many experts believe this is the moment to shift our power generation and transport system to sustainable climate friendly alternatives to get to that place some key questions need to be resolved one of the most extreme changes brought about by the covid 19 crisis is the glimpse it has given us of how our electricity systems might work in years to come an important aspect of that is the idea seen during the pandemic that there are times when consumers are paid to use energy during the coronavirus lockdown electricity consumption was down across europe by around 15% but because of a very sunny and windy spring supplies of renewable energy boomed wholesale electricity across europe is priced on an hourly basis for the day ahead so abundant supplies and weak demand saw prices go below zero at times negative prices were once a rarity but they plunged into the negative 66 times in april in the uk on tuesday 21 april uk prices were in the negative from 0900 to 1600 they dipped to just under minus \u00a384 per megawatt hour at one oclock for grid operators worried about too much power in the system its often easier for them to pay customers to use the power than to shut down the generators consumers who had signed up to flexible real time tariffs with one uk energy supplier found themselves encouraged to use electricity when it went negative youre doing a service to the national grid says greg jackson from octopus energy the company who encouraged their customers to use more during negative pricing episodes the grid is going to pay someone to deal with this problem of oversupply they will pay a company to build batteries or they will pay companies to stop generating or you can pay customers to use electricity at those times these are all different ways of providing the service of balancing the grid on that april tuesday octopus energy customers were getting around 4p per unit of electricity they used not a fortune but perhaps a sign of things to come the transition to a greener future means that grids will face huge influxes of power from intermittent suppliers while demand will probably fall flexible pricing will likely remain a feature this is a clear signal that the era of big centralised base load generation is over and that the future will be powered by renewables energy storage and flexible power plants said bj\u00f6rn ullbro from w\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 energy business a power sector company so how have the grids coped with conditions during the covid 19 crisis that many believed wouldnt occur for years much better than i would have ever thought they would is the verdict of dave jones an electricity analyst with climate change think tank ember across europe theyre coping remarkably well they have less of an isolated electricity system because they have interconnectors so you dont have quite the same highs and lows as you do within the uk but faced with this and the challenges of staff getting ill and having to go off into isolation just keeping the lights on and keeping the electricity system operating through this is a minor miracle in itself one of the most significant potential outcomes from the covid 19 crisis has been the disruption to shale oil drilling in many parts of the us hydraulic fracturing or fracking has become the main plank of a massive shift in us energy production over the past decade fracking uses of a mixture of water sand and chemicals under high pressure to crack open oil  and gas bearing rocks when combined with horizontal drilling technology production of oil and gas soared according to the us energy information administration eia in 2019 shale oil accounted for 63% of americas total crude oil production shale even saw the us become the worlds number one exporter of oil for a brief period last year but the coronavirus pandemic and the consequent drop in demand for oil has hit fracking very hard indeed according to eia figures the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the us has fallen by 56% in the permian basin north americas largest shale region the number of rigs fell from 405 in march to 175 in early may so does this dramatic drop signal the end of fracking people have called doom on the fracking industry many times said bethany mclean an author and expert on the business but there are a few things that are different right now i do think oil production will be significantly lower than it was because i dont think the capital is going to return to the degree that it did in the past and i think public market investors are disillusioned with the sector but to call the death of fracking just because the economics dont work might be going too far one major factor that might help revive the fracking industry after covid 19 is politics president trump has so far shown little interest in bailing out fracking directly his administration has been more focused on supporting saudi arabia and russia in their efforts to cut oil production and drive up prices but higher oil prices may hit us consumers at the petrol pump not a great idea in an election year right now when oil is such a significant part of us industry especially in republican states it is very challenging for the government said paola rodriguez masiu an oil market analyst with rystad energy in oslo norway they are trying to balance the low oil prices they have always liked with having an oil price that is high enough to prevent their domestic industry from dying that balancing act could very tricky for fracking it is highly likely that after the pandemic governments will be asking themselves if atomic energy makes sense given the challenges the world is facing supporters say that during the crisis nuclear plants provided around 40 45% of the low carbon electricity used in europe because of the existing focus on safety in the industry they have coped well with covid 19 say sources and they are well placed to cope with an ongoing health crisis safety is already embedded into the culture so embracing some of the additional safety required to deal with covid 19 has been something i think that was very easily taken on by the nuclear industry said jonathan cobb from the world nuclear association and there hasnt been a situation where because of infections or people self isolating on a precautionary basis theres had to be a close down of a nuclear power station what makes the industry bullish about the future is that governments will want to invest in large infrastructure projects to provide employment while at the same time greening their energy systems while much of the investment in nuclear has taken place in china and russia in recent years the time could now be right for more reactors in europe and the us we have got the first power stations under construction in the uk weve got construction in finland in france but also in eastern europe theres been continuing new build said jonathan cobb so weve got a high level of new build already with more than 50 reactors being built around the world and yeah the hope is that this will now accelerate and increase while there are worries about accidents and nuclear waste some electricity experts believe nuclear energy is not flexible enough for modern grids made up of lots of different energy sources the flexibility of nuclear has always been a problem in this said dave jones an electricity analyst at ember it runs 24 7 with very little ability to be able to reduce load around the outside of that which is what the national grid would actually need coming out of the crisis there is a great deal of hope   and indeed quite a deal of hype   around hydrogen as an energy source hydrogen can be made from natural gas but as thats a fossil fuel it needs to have its carbon captured in some way to make it  sustainable however a greener version can be produced from water by using renewable energy to power a process of electrolysis as well as not producing any co2 the resulting gas doesnt contribute to air pollution when its burned advocates believe it could be the answer to one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise heavy transport such as lorries and buses as good as batteries are in lighter smaller vehicles they are less applicable in larger vehicles generally because of the weight said eamonn ives from the centre for policy studies who has published a report on how hydrogen could be key to decarbonising transport at the scale of something like a bus or a truck you could be talking at least a couple to a few tonnes in weight purely in the batteries themselves when you get to have that sort of size hydrogen does appear to be quite an elegant solution to decarbonise lots of vehicles hydrogens strength is its versatility   as well as powering lorries and buses it can be used in the mix for gas to heat our homes and in the wake of the covid 19 crisis the eu and germany are both keen on increasing investments in this future fuel the gas does come with some big challenges   making it with green energy is not hugely efficient as yet it also needs to be kept under pressure to use in vehicles which right now are very expensive for energy campaigners hydrogen has great potential as long as it is made from renewables and doesnt become a smokescreen for the continued use of fossil fuels the fact that theres currently so much focus on hydrogen gives us hope that the hard to decarbonise sectors like aviation and shipping will finally find a solution to their decarbonisation dilemma so in that sense we are positively welcoming this hydrogen discussion said laura buffet from transport & environment a brussels based campaign group we dont want to see a situation where we ended up supporting fossil based technologies and that really would be counter productive  we need to be careful and make sure that we have the right safety safeguards in place to ensure that the hydrogen roadmap focuses on renewables based hydrogen perhaps one of the strongest positives for hydrogen is that it attracts support from across the political spectrum unlike wind or solar i think it appeals to the conservative side of the political divide because in many ways hydrogen is kind of like diesel or petrol but without the bad stuff said eamonn ives and so you can quite easily transition say the transport fleet over to hydrogen without making an awful lot of change to behavioural patterns my colleague justin rowlatt has taken a look at the impact of the covid 19 crisis on coal in a separate article like coal the future for other fossil fuels is now uncertain and depends to a large extent on how governments spend their stimulus packages one of the most critical questions is over oil over the last 10 years the rise of the diesel  and petrol powered suvs around the world has really helped co2 emissions ramp up in fact suvs were the second largest contributor to the increase in global co2 emissions since 2010   after the power sector thanks to the drop in car travel and aviation fuel oil demand has now fallen away dramatically initially there were concerns that the world would run out of storage as producers were determined to keep pumping but opec the organization of the petroleum exporting countries agreed to reduce output just in time if opec had not cut we would be in huge trouble said paola rodriguez masiu with rystad energy but because they did cut production the armageddon situation   where the world storage space was not enough to handle the volume   didnt happen now experts are expecting a rise in demand as countries emerge from the covid 19 crisis and if opec maintains the same level of production cuts prices will start to rise longer term analysts believe there will be a strong rebound in oil prices as many oil drilling projects that were due to start this year and next have been put on ice it basically means that we will have less supply than we will otherwise need said paolo rodriguez masiu so for the last part of 2021 and the beginning of 2022 our prices will be quite bullish but even if prices rise some experts say the writing is on the wall we have seen the oil majors reiterate their commitment to clean energy and spare renewables from any cost cuts said dr valentina kretzschmar from global energy research consultancy wood mackenzie recovery in oil and gas prices is unlikely to slow down the transition however what is likely to slow it down is increasing demand for oil and gas products as economies start to come back to life it is now more important than ever for governments to act and commit to rebuilding economies on green principles the eu is leading the way with its green deal we also need to see stimulus packages being tied to companies commitments to carbon reductions following the example of canada equally financial regulators need to step up pressures with mandatory reporting on climate related issues follow matt on twitter"

to take place online and socialising very difficult universities are currently considering how they will operate from september and many of them have already decided to alter their normal schedule plans include you need to contact individual universities or check their websites to find out what they have decided deadlines to decide on whether to accept offers have been pushed back to 18 june you make two choices   a firm first choice university and an insurance or back up one and then decline any other offers if you meet the offer conditions of the first choice you are in   otherwise the back up alternative comes into play even then you are not committed to going if you choose not to places at specific universities can be cancelled online and if you decide not to go to university at all you must phone the ones holding you a place to ask for your application to be withdrawn none of this will leave you out of pocket the government says university students in england will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn however some students are unhappy about this one started a petition demanding a refund for lost teaching after face to

students nus official told the bbc we would recommend that students think carefully before signing any binding contracts or agreements for next year especially in the case of rental contracts some

september a survey by the university and college union found that more than one in five students could defer going to university this year universities and colleges take varied approaches to the issue some will not allow deferred entry for subjects such as medicine but will consider it for other courses however you need to check that the same course is being offered the following year you could also be asked your reasons for wanting to defer when your application is considered a recent study revealed that two thirds of international students still intend to take up their offers abroad including in the uk idp connect which works in global marketing for students surveyed nearly 6900 students and found that 69% of them were not changing their plans however prospective postgraduate students from east asia largely favour a face to face start in january to an online one in the autumn according to a british council study the survey of more than 15000 students carried out in april and may also showed that uk universities are likely to have nearly 14000 fewer new enrolments in 2020 21 compared to 2018 19 this would lead to a drop of \u00a3463m in spending on tuition and living expenses a plea from universities in england for a \u00a32bn bailout from the government was rejected however to help with cashflow \u00a326bn of tuition fee income and \u00a3100m of research funding

of their own experiences the bbc spoke to a man who has sent two unexpected lockdown apologies   and to a woman who has received one it was another friday evening in lockdown of staring at a computer screen toggling between news sites and social media when the email from james arrived irina waited a beat trying to recall the last time she had thought of her first boyfriend before clicking it open irina i know this is out of the blue and years too late it began but this is a message i need to send she had been 16 and ready for a boyfriend when she met james it seemed like a normal step a girl her age should take so much of her life hadnt been typical born in moscow irina had come to the uk on a two week student exchange and liked the education system here at the age of 14 she told her parents she wanted to leave russia and go to a british boarding school after initial hesitation they gave in irinas mother had been a railway conductor from a rural part of russia when she fell in love with irinas father a passenger on her train she was 19 he was 30 weeks later she packed her bags and knocked on his door 1000 miles away informing him that they should now live together how could they deny their daughter her own big adventure arriving in england irina felt the culture shock immediately growing up in moscow irinas inner city school had been in her words hardcore there were fights in the toilets and open bullying here she was amused by mandatory chapel visits and the invisible social hierarchies of an english school irina found her way into the ecosystem and made friends over time and after a giggly afternoon in a park one boy in particular caught her eye james fitted the brief for a cool boyfriend he was cute he was funny at 17 he was a year older than irina he was tall too they texted over the next few weeks and soon their relationship became official though the cracks appeared right away when youre that age status amongst friends is very important irina says and it was very important for james to appear cool in public there were jokes at irinas expense among their mutual friends in private james was frustrated if she appeared to be better than him at some things if i was better than him at crosswords he would be insulted and say but youre russian your english shouldnt be as good as mine irina says and i would reassure him by saying its not im just good at crosswords eventually two years later irina was told by mutual friends that james had confessed hed cheated on her irina ended the relationship abruptly distancing herself as best she could telling him she didnt want contact she moved to a different city for university and a fresh start james texted sporadically over the next couple of years   always on her birthday and to wish her happy new year eventually after one exchange irina suggested to james that for them to successfully move on it would be better if they cut contact altogether james response was swift and icy he wasnt trying to get back together with irina he wrote then he told her to never message him again irina stared at the message and responded lol that she decided would be the end of this chapter of her life years passed and irina moved again settling into a tech job now at ease making friends she found her rhythm in a new city when coronavirus hit irinas work sent her a keyboard and a large monitor so she could work from home and then the email from james arrived in the 800 word message james explained that lockdown had forced him to assess his own past behaviour and he felt he owed her an apology for his immaturity all those years ago he apologised about how he had behaved saying that he felt mortified when he read the texts he had sent her and then he made a stunning confession he had never actually cheated on irina   that too had been a lie to impress their friends he went on to write that he had been volunteering to help vulnerable communities during lockdown and now was a time for true reflection and for people to be kinder to one another transported back in time with a mix of emotions she hadnt felt in years irina went for a walk to clear her head when she got back she decided to reply she told him to be kind to himself and said that everyone has made mistakes especially when they are young and then she addressed his apology i dont have a reaction to your apology perhaps i have forgiven you perhaps i stopped caring i hope it brings you closure to know i feel no ill feelings towards you she thought for a moment wondering if this was a fair response i think he was looking for redemption from me irina says but its not really for me to give it to him hes the only one who can give it to himself   forgive himself irina sent the email and went back to her computer her evening and her life it was 10 days into lockdown when chris texted sarah the last time hed seen her she was on the floor of her room curled up in the foetal position tears and hiccups breaking up her breathing he left her that way she wanted him to this was the end result of a long and emotional conversation and the conclusion of their eight month relationship he thought of her occasionally in the years that followed they still followed each other on social media but she had faded into memory a college girlfriend now seven years later that image kept popping back into chriss mind sarah on the floor in tears chris began lockdown on 10 march the day the us national emergency commission advised restaurants and bars to close and a presidential directive asked people to work from home where they could the week before a typical day for him started at 530am hed work out with his colleagues at the army base in missouri where he worked as an it engineer go home shower eat and go back to the base he lived alone in an apartment nearby after finishing work hed go home again and either go out with friends or make dinner and hang out online until it was time for bed with lockdown came a lot of free time at first he kept busy but after 10 days of zoom calls and youtube workouts and the whole second season of succession his mind kept going back to that image of his first girlfriend hed met sarah when they were 18 at a military academy it was an intense relationship chris now 26 says we spent all of our time together all our plans were together and so was our identity as teenagers at the start of their career with the us army they shared all their problems with each other as the months went by though sarahs troubled relationship with her family began to consume her according to chris and he felt ill equipped to help when he finally told her all this saying he didnt think they could carry on sarah dissolved into tears on the floor she was devastated this was too abrupt an end to their relationship she said they avoided each other for the rest of their time at the academy sometimes awkwardly then they graduated and went their separate ways and thats how it stayed   until on 19 march chris sent sarah a text sarah i understand that its been a long time but i really feel that the way that we ended things wasnt right and the way that i treated you at the end of our relationship was a disservice to you i know weve both had a lot of time apart from each other and i would really like to make that up to you i really hope youre doing well the response came almost immediately im doing great and the two began to exchange texts she brought him up to speed on her new teaching job which she loved and she added excitedly she had a much better relationship with her parents she said for a while she couldnt see me because i was someone who had caused her pain but that was all over now chris says she said she now realised that we werent right for each other emboldened by the warmth of their interaction chris decided to text a second ex well ex may be a stretch we were more friends with benefits he says we didnt ever say we were exclusive lisa and chris had matched on tinder in 2016 they lived in different cities she lived in washington dc where chris had family the relationship was carried out mostly online we chatted on almost every single social media app and then mostly by text says chris in the beginning they had video chats but that gradually decreased they saw each other every few months hooking up when they were in the same place over the next couple of years that petered out too eventually settling into an online friendship then on new years eve 2018 lisa and chris found themselves in the same city and arranged to meet up to ring in the new year along with a mutual friend lisa had a new boyfriend sam by then shed told chris about him even sharing points of tension she felt in their relationship it was the first time chris and he had met the night began in a friendly enough tone but soon everyone was drunk and in the midst of a blurry conversation chris brought up something lisa had told him in confidence about her relationship with sam it was so personal that chris knew as soon as he spoke that he had broken the trust between them after an argument outside lisa sam and their friend left chris to go to another venue lisa later texted chris to say how angry she was that he had shared her confession with sam it was the last time chris saw lisa so after his message to sarah chris texted lisa you were and are very important to me and im sorry for everything that i did that night i know that i crossed a bunch of lines and i wish i hadnt i hope youre doing well and lockdown is ok lisas reply came the next day she said she was well lockdown was going ok and she and sam were now married but it was clear that she didnt wish to continue the conversation she didnt address or accept chriss apology chris says that he hopes he would have apologised to both women in time even if lockdown were not a factor but maybe it would have been a drunk text in the middle of the night he says he accepts that apologies may be seen by some as selfish because they answer the senders needs and not necessarily the recipients but he says he wasnt expecting either sarah or lisa to say anything that would make him feel better i cant say i wasnt doing it in the hope that they would absolve me i wasnt expecting a reply from either and if they hadnt forgiven me it would have been fine by me too i just wanted them to know that i wasnt ok with some of my past behaviour nastaran tavakoli far is the co host of the gender knot a podcast that explores cultural issues shes hosted loads and loads and loads of shows on the psychology of an apology and what motivates someone to make one lockdown she says adds another dimension theres the obvious reason why we are reflecting on our behaviour weve all got a lot of time to think a lot of the things we do to avoid reflection arent possible right now like travelling socialising commuting at the same time its an opportunity to become thoughtful about your relationships and ask all these big fundamental questions of the purpose in your life and what your legacy is but apologies need to be thought through she says you should never give an apology to feel better making an apology is only the first step to making amends you need to be ready for the person to respond in any way they need and not at all if they want while you have time to think about the bad things in the past so does the person receiving the apology and you may trigger an emotion in them that they dont necessarily want right now all names of those making and receiving apologies have been changed have you received an apology from your ex during lockdown or sent one"
