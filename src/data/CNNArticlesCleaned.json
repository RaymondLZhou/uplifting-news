reviewed video that witnesses posted on social media cnn obtained two videos of the incident including surveillance video from wendys released by the gbi the other video was provided by an eyewitness

officer is heard telling brooks to stop fighting and hands off the taser the eyewitness told cnn that by the time they arrived on the scene brooks car was parked in a parking spot the fight started when they tried to make an arrest  after that he took a taser and took off the witness said as the scuffle broke up the video shows brooks beginning to run from the officers and he is seen holding

wendys surveillance video doesnt show the scuffle but shows brooks running away from where police cars are parked in that video brooks appears to point the stun gun at the atlanta officer at that point the atlanta officer reaches down and retrieves his weapon from his holster discharges it strikes mr brooks there on the parking lot and he goes down reynolds the gbi director said in a press conference on saturday the eyewitness is heard saying in additional video obtained by cnn that brooks was still breathing as he lay on the ground brooks was taken to a hospital where he died the statement said one officer was treated for an injury and released the gbi said mayor criticizes officer at a news conference saturday atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms criticized the officer who shot brooks saying there is a clear distinction between what you can do and what you should do i do not believe this was a justified use of deadly force bottoms said bottoms said it was apd chief erika shields decision to step aside and she will remain with the city in an undetermined role in a statement shields said shes stepping down out of a deep and abiding love for this city and this department apd has my full support and mayor bottoms has my support on the future direction of this department i have faith in the mayor and it is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law

calm conversation with the officers before they tried to arrest him he wasnt doing anything violent or crazy stewart said police have argued in the past that a stun gun is not a deadly weapon so there

        "text": "washington top us military officials are seeking to reassure the nations roughly two million active duty and reserve personnel that they are committed to addressing issues of racial inequality across the branches following george floyds death and protests across the country but the challenges they face are huge a cnn review of data provided by the pentagon and department of veterans affairs reveals the stark reality that black service members are less likely to become officers and as a result are more likely to be seriously injured serving their country than their white colleagues those issues are very much intertwined according to david shulkin who previously served as president donald trumps veterans affairs secretary while theres been some increase in relative numbers in minority officers its not been proportional to the increase that were serving so therefore you do have more minority members serving in the front line jobs and therefore getting higher numbers of these injuries he told cnn in an interview friday the data reviewed by cnn includes a mix of publicly available numbers and records kept by the department of defense cnn has reached out to the pentagon for comment veterans are becoming more diverse while an overwhelming majority of service members are still white the numbers reflect a steady rise in diversity within the military that coincides with the adoption of policies of integration and equal rights for black service members in the wake of world war ii less than 10% of world war ii veterans were minorities but since then each veteran cohort has been more diverse than the last of the veterans who have served since september 11 2001 35% are minorities according to the data reviewed by cnn black veterans make up 15% of veterans who have served since then while integration policies were adopted by the army and navy well before many states in the south and other american institutions took similar steps it took years before the changes were enforced resulting in retention issues for the branches according to the department of defense significant support for segregation in the army continued into the early 1950s and the service did not complete its integration until 1954 according to the pentagon current and former service members have been quick to point out that even though todays military is significantly more diverse than it has ever been there are still major challenges to be met as a society we are just now hopefully dealing with the original sin and dealing with a lot of the underlying issues of race and inequality so the military has not been isolated from that bishop garrison a black west point graduate who served two tours in iraq told cnn black service members underrepresented in officer ranks one of those issues is the lack of minority service members in leadership positions black service members are still disproportionately under represented among the officer ranks despite enlisting at a higher rate than other minorities and whites relative to their share of the us population department of defense data shows black service members represent 19% of all enlisted personnel but just 9% of officers for white service members the trend reverses two thirds of all enlisted service members are white but among officer ranks more than three quarters are white it is an issue that has been highlighted in the wake of floyds death most notably in a post from the air forces top enlistee earlier this month chief master sgt kaleth wright whos responsible for 410000 enlisted members said his greatest fear is not that i will be killed by a white police officer believe me my heart starts racing like most other black men in america when i see those blue lights behind me  but that i will wake up to a report that one of our black airmen has died at the hands of a white police officer he also outlined his struggle with the air forces own demons of racial disparities in military justice and discipline and the clear lack of diversity in leadership current and former service members have echoed that point suggesting issues like the lack of diversity in leadership roles continues to have a direct impact on the retention and recruitment of minorities the fact is that had i been afforded more direct mentorship and more examples of leaders who reflected my own life experience i would have been more likely to remain a member of the army like my father a half century before me i decided to seek out other ways to continue serving my community and country garrison who current works as human rights firsts chief ambassador to the national security community told the house armed services committee in january garrison also told lawmakers that some of the current administrations policies are also having a negative impact on the recruitment and retention of minority service members the fact that many major military bases are still named after confederate leaders the ongoing worries about white nationalism in the militarys ranks and the fact that an individual who holds extreme views on race continues to serve at the highest level of immigration policy making    these factors risk causing a detrimental impact on our militarys ability to recruit and retain new and diverse talent he said during his testimony before the committee first black service member to lead a us military branch the lack of diversity at the highest levels of the military was highlighted yet again this month when the senate voted to confirm gen charles q brown as the first black service member to lead an american military branch earlier this week while browns confirmation has been applauded as a historic moment for the military the fact that it took place more than 70 years after president harry s trumans executive order that desegregated the services underscores the incremental pace at which change has occurred prior to his confirmation brown reflected on the impact of floyds death while addressing some of the challenges and fears that he has endured as a black service member in a moving deeply personal video brown said he was full with emotion for the many african americans that have suffered the same fate as george floyd he also described being one of the only african americans at his school and often being the only african american in his platoon and later in leadership im thinking about a history of racial issues and my own experiences that didnt always sing of liberty brown said im thinking about wearing the same flight suit with the same wings on my chest as my peers and then being questioned by another military member are you a pilot im thinking about the pressure i felt to perform error free especially for supervisors i perceived had expected less of me as an african american im thinking about having to represent by working twice as hard to prove their expectations and perceptions of african americans were invalid he added brown said he hopes he can help address some of those issues in his new role as the first african american chief of staff for any military branch im thinking about how my nomination provides some hope but also comes with a heavy burden i cant fix centuries of racism in our country nor can i fix decades of discrimination that may have impacted members of our air force im thinking about how i can make improvements personally professionally and institutionally so that all airmen both today and tomorrow appreciate the value of diversity and can serve in an environment where they can reach their full potential he said black veterans more likely to sustain severe injuries during service for minority service members and black veterans in particular the challenges they face while in the military have had a direct impact on their long term health a review of va data shows that black veterans are more likely to sustain severe injuries during their service    a trend that is directly linked to the fact that they are disproportionately working frontline jobs during their time in the military according to shulkin in the va system youre seeing a reflection of what has come from the department of defense which is a growing proportion of minorities or serving many of them in frontline roles he told cnn the department of veterans affairs assigns injured veterans a disability rating which represents how much a service related injury affects their earning ability the ratings determine the amount of the monthly benefit they should receive as compensation they range from 0% to 100%    the higher the rating the more severe a veterans disability nearly 31% of injured black veterans have a disability rating of 70% or higher compared with around 23% of white injured veterans according to the data the disability rating is an indicator of the severity of the injury and the disruption to life after serving shulkin said adding that the current data is a reflection of the numbers of minorities who are serving as well as the roles and categories of job duties that they are doing in the military while our minority communities are shouldering the disproportionate share of service to the country they are not necessarily being represented in the more senior positions to that same level he added those numbers become even more troubling given the fact that the minority veteran population is projected to increase over the next 20 years despite the fact that the total number of veterans is expected to decrease over that same time period according to the va "

        "text": "growing up in the middle of nowhere marc wiley said he had two choices for recreation go fast and shoot stuff and ive never been that interested in guns he said as a result wiley a black man who lives in northern vermont has followed nascar for most of his life he used to write magazine articles and ran a youtube channel dedicated to the sport he loves the energy at the races the camaraderie of the campgrounds and the sound of cars roaring by everyone he said should go to a race at least once in recent years however he pulled away from nascar because he felt it had inadequately addressed social issues like police brutality and racial injustice it didnt feel like i belonged there anymore wiley said or at least that my voice wasnt heard there anymore that changed this week when nascar announced it would ban the confederate flag from races just days after the only full time african american driver in nascars cup series bubba wallace donned a shirt emblazoned i cant breathe and unveiled a black lives matter paint scheme in the wake of protests sparked by the police killing of george floyd in minneapolis that was huge wiley said for african american nascar fans who spoke to cnn the confederate flag ban and wallaces decision to be more outspoken about race are welcome but overdue changes in a sport they felt had failed to be inclusive in the past for them being a black fan has meant years of feeling overlooked of ignoring hurtful remarks by their favorite drivers and steering clear of fans and campsites who they feared would be unwelcoming but now theyre hoping to see more people who look like them at the racetrack im really excited about the direction the sports headed in and i havent been able to say that for a couple years now wiley said it meant the world nascar announced the confederate flag ban wednesday writing in a statement that the flags presence at nascar events runs contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans our competitors and our industry bringing people together around a love for racing and the community that it creates is what makes our fans and sport special the statement said many in and outside nascars fan base praised the stock car racing league among those supporters was mark mosley who told cnn his kids joke that hes the only black man on the south side of chicago who likes nascar mosley admitted hes struggled with his love of the sport over the years mosley said hes probably taken 10 friends to chicagoland speedway hoping to convince them they could like nascar too none of them wanted to return because of the environment he said half of them left halfway through the race when former driver richard petty \u2014 mosleys idol growing up \u2014 came out against kneeling during the national anthem mosley said it was like a dagger to the heart he decided to stop watching altogether after driver kyle larson used the n word in a virtual racing event in april i gave up on nascar to be honest but he changed his mind this week i was elated excited happy any positive adjective or adverb you can think of he said of the flag ban it meant the world to me as an african american nascar fan another fan alex burns said he felt alienated from the rest of the fan base at times walking around a track or in the campgrounds burns said he kept his head on the swivel avoiding campsites where people were drinking and flying the confederate flag while that feeling never deterred burns from enjoying the sport he said hes very proud of nascar for banning the flag im even more of a fan of nascar he said adding later i just hope people understand that you know its time for change there arent a lot of people who look like me brehanna daniels \u2014 the first black woman to pit in a nascar national series race \u2014 also supports the flag ban im very proud of nascar right now daniels told cnn in an interview were moving on up the ladder were taking baby steps but were changing things for the better daniels was nervous when she first became a nascar tire changer through the drive for diversity program which aims to bring more minorities and women into the nascar fold there arent a lot of people who look like me daniels said its a beautiful thing when you see multiple faces \u2014 like in the nba and the nfl theres people of different races ethnicities i like seeing diversity and in nascar you really dont see much of that so for daniels the steps taken this week are meaningful changes it honestly meant a lot she told cnn wiping away tears because its hard being black yall she pointed to the deaths of george floyd and breonna taylor saying nobody deserves to die like that i applaud nascar for finally realizing that things need to change for the better she said i will always be behind them because of that flag represents division not history fans say not everyone agreed the flag ban was the right decision youre getting both sides a lot of positive outreach and gaining new fans as we go bubba wallace told cnns don lemon then you got your fans who will never watch nascar again the same fans who will never watch the nfl after the kneeling the same fans that were crying out that were ruining their lives and just throwing a pity party one high profile detractor was ray ciccarelli a part time driver in the nascar gander rv & outdoors truck series who announced he would quit at the end of this season writing in a statement i dont believe in kneeling during anthem nor taken ppl right to fly what ever flag they love i could care less about the confederate flag he added but there are ppl that do and it doesnt make them a racist other fans spoke out on social media insisting the flag was about history or southern heritage not a symbol of racism andria renee phillips an african american fan since the early 2000s said it didnt really bother her when she saw the flag at nascar events agreeing it was a part of history \u2014 though she said it was painful no matter how you look at it i feel like the flag is a reminder of what was she said but then theres different perspectives on the flag  it has memories for people good bad whatever it may be but to daniels the confederate flag represents division and thats not what we want she said were more about togetherness and not being divided im behind nascar all the way but i felt that was dividing us burns told cnn that while the flag may be part of history it represents a bad time in history where we as black people were enslaved in terms of history  mosley said history has proven that blacks have always been mistreated so historically speaking to me the confederate flag represents hate were being listened to a big part of the nascar experience is hanging out at campsites within the tracks infield leading up to a race wiley said but whenever he saw the confederate flag flying at a campsite it was an indication to me of like i dont know what these people are about you want to be part of this whole big family atmosphere he said but at the same time its like i dont know if im welcome here over the years as he became more aware of social issues like police brutality wiley felt nascar failed to reach out to black fans even as the black lives matter movement grew wiley said nascar was still very much on the side of blue lives matter we support our law enforcement we support the military everything else i didnt mind them saying we support law enforcement he said but at the same time to completely ignore the other side of the argument was kind of insulting to me in 2015 after nine black churchgoers were massacred at emanuel african methodist episcopal church in charleston south carolina nascar issued a statement saying it would continue to disallow use of the confederate flag symbol in any officials nascar capacity but it stopped short of an outright ban and wiley wondered if it would ever happen but he felt nascar had no choice in recent years nascar has dealt with a narrative of declining viewership and attendance without efforts to be more inclusive wiley felt theyre not going to make it there arent enough people who still believe in this to sustain it thats why black nascar fans are excited they hope this change will help attract more black and brown fans to the sport for wiley the ban and wallaces black lives matter paint scheme were one of the most uplifting things for a fan whos felt disconnected from nascar for a long time were accepted and were being listened to \u2014 in this space he said finally nascar needs more diversity daniels said and with the recent things that have happened a lot of minorities are saying hey whens the next race im trying to come with more of that she said nascar will have a bigger audience a bigger crowd one day daniels hopes shell look up from the pit road and see a sea of diverse faces looking back at her that would be a sight to see wouldnt it cnns

drive thru convention rep denver riggleman of virginia lost to bob good a former campbell county supervisor and former employee of the liberty university athletics department with 42% of the vote to goods 58% according to results provided to cnn by 5th district republican committee chairman melvin adams sunday morning all day saturday delegates voted in the 5th districts gop convention by driving through the parking lot of a lynchburg church    a change in format due to the coronavirus pandemic the church was the only voting location in the expansive district which stretches from the north carolina border north toward the outer suburbs of washington dc the ballot tabulation went into the early hours of sunday morning late saturday before the results were known riggleman tweeted about voting irregularities and ballot stuffing voter fraud has been a hallmark of this nomination process and i will not stand for it the congressman tweeted before adding that the republican party of virginia needs to reevaluate their priorities we are evaluating all our options at this time he said cnn has reached out to rigglemans office for comment adams said in an email sunday there were only a handful of discrepancies as i understand there was a difference between the marked delegate list and actual ballot count in once instance and a ballot that seems to have been fraudulently cast in another with a total discrepancy being a matter of two 2 raw votes adams said the internecine battle was a test of the enduring power of cultural conservatism within the gop    and whether an incumbent whose libertarian streak led him to support same sex marriage would be punished by his partys base despite having the backing of president donald trump riggleman a freshman member of the hardline conservative house freedom caucus officiated the wedding of two of his former male campaign volunteers last summer some members of the 5th districts gop committee who also found him to be insufficiently conservative on immigration and other issues tried to censure him two county gop committees voted to censure him and another unanimously passed a motion of no confidence against him according to roll call rigglemans campaign had pushed to have a primary rather than a convention which restricts the participants to gop delegates who tend to be more conservative party activists than typical primary voters the congressmans campaign also pushed to have the location of the convention moved accusing the districts gop committee of favoring good since the church is located in his home county but the committee rejected the campaigns appeal last month riggleman significantly outraised good raking in about $16 million to goods roughly $186000 by the end of the pre covention reporting period on may 24 according to filings with the federal election commission despite goods previous employment at liberty university riggleman had the backing of jerry falwell jr the schools president trump had endorsed the congressman in december calling him a true conservative leader who would support his agenda the trump administration late friday rolled back an obama era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender good jumped into the race in september accusing riggleman in an interview with the hill of having betrayed the trust of the conservative republican base of his virginia district which includes charlottesville and danville he opposes same sex marriage and abortion without exceptions while riggleman sees same sex marriage as an issue of individual liberty and supports some exceptions to bans on abortion an immigration hardliner good wants to end birthright citizenship and make english the official national language to stop accommodating immigrants and their native tongues because its our unity thats our strength according to the roanoke times he will face the winner of the democratic primary held later this month good though will have to wait to see if he makes the november general election ballot after missing the june 9 filing deadline on friday the virginia republican party sent a letter to the state board of elections asking for an extension for good and other candidates who missed the filing deadline to appear on the ballot the letter said that granting good an extension would not be unlike election changes localities have made across the state this year during the pandemic including the lowering of signature requirements for ballot access the board is slated to hold a meeting on july 7 to decide on the extension the democratic congressional campaign committee put the 5th district on its target list for 2020 and democrats think that good as the nominee may give them a better shot at flipping the district which outside republican groups have spent money in during the past two cycles but in a district that trump carried by 11 points in 2016 republicans likely start with an advantage a distillery owner riggleman first won election to congress in 2018 he gained national attention during that race when his democratic opponent attacked him as a devotee of bigfoot erotica which he denied in an interview with cnn at the time riggleman acknowledged writing two books on bigfoot including an unpublished text called the mating habits of bigfoot and why women want him both of which he said were parody and stemmed from running jokes he had with friends from the military riggleman is the third house incumbent to lose this year after democratic rep dan lipinski of illinois and republican rep steve king of iowa lost their primaries earlier this year "

viking chief who ruled england denmark and norway in the 11th century became infamous for a stunt that historians believe was misunderstood if it even happened sitting grandly in a throne at the seashore and ordering the ocean to stop the incoming waves but the myth of the leader who tried to hold back the tide seemed to apply this week to the president of the united states george floyd died on memorial day his neck under the knee of a police officer in the three weeks since protests against police abuses have sparked a swift and searching national conversation about racism cities and states have moved to ban chokeholds and create new safeguards against police misconduct companies large and small have committed to changes in the way they work and in some cases have replaced executives military leaders have spoken out forcefully against racism and shows of force against peaceful protesters networks canceled shows built around police as heroes a robert e lee statue in richmond virginia was toppled and nascar banned the confederate flag dare we believe asked marcus mabry that this is the moment when america finally changes the trauma of 400 years of soul destroying racism is not easily forgotten    some researchers believe it is imprinted in our very dna and were all too cognizant of the dashed promises of the past from liberation to reconstruction to the civil rights movement but change does come history teaches us that it came to south africa it came to the american south is this our moment van jones wrote this sudden mass realization    and the multi racial demonstrations that give it weight life and substance    feels like a miracle to me as a black man i have spent my entire life trying to convince relatively small numbers of white people to take racial injustice seriously i have usually failed now major corporations are making my argument for me hundreds of thousands of white protesters are risking their lives in the middle of a pandemic to chant black lives matter and i have begun to believe that    just maybe    the world for my two black sons might actually be a better place yet with the ground shifting all around him donald trump refused to be drawn into the national mood instead he stuck to his law and order message and even tweeted that the incident of a 75 year old protester who suffered a head injury when he was pushed by police might have been part of a setup he seemed to want to turn back the clock to the days of his youth when social unrest enabled republican politicians of the 1960s to gain favor with frightened white voters on one point though trump bent to criticism rescheduling the date of his first rally since the pandemic began he moved it from june 19 the holiday celebrating the end of slavery known as juneteenth to june 20 out of respect commentators had questioned the original date and location of the rally    tulsa oklahoma frida ghitis wrote that tulsa was the site of a race massacre 99 years ago that remains one of the worst acts of racial violence in us history in 1921 hundreds of african americans were killed when white mobs looted and burned what had been a thriving neighborhood known as black wall street not buying in as black lives matter morphed from activist slogan to nationally recognized belief trump didnt buy in wrote dean obeidallah while trump has condemned the specific officers involved in the killing of floyd as a terrible insult to police and policemen he refuses to address the racism embedded in the nations criminal justice system attorney general william barr acting department of homeland security head chad wolf and economic adviser larry kudlow all disputed the existence of systemic racism in law enforcement instead they seem to believe in essence there are just a few bad apples obeidallah said this is stunning given the data that makes it clear that our criminal justice system    as a whole    is far from color blind as for trump passing along the conspiracy theory about the 75 year old protester in buffalo jill filipovic wrote the presidents potentially defamatory tweet deserves like so many of his actions swift response and condemnation but members of his own party are so gutless and craven they deny having seen the tweet to begin with presumably so that they might escape having to comment on it or refuse to comment all together privately gop officials are much more likely to express dismay at what their partys leader says and does washington reporters have noted in new york magazine andrew sullivan wrote trumps response to the epidemic has more plainly revealed a man utterly out of his depth in ways even his strongest supporters must now quietly understand military chiefs who might be expected to share many aspects of trumps conservative worldview have been withering in their scorn for his recent stances as peter bergen observed it has been extraordinary to see over the past week the flood of public criticism of president donald trump for his handling of the protests over the death of george floyd coming from so many of the united states leading retired generals and admirals including unprecedented criticism from four who have served in the post of top ranking military officer in the nation chairman of the joint chiefs ask those who know ask andre mcgregor if theres systemic bias in law enforcement graduating from the fbi academy was one of the proudest moments of his life but he wrote shortly after i graduated from quantico a cop friend in town  proceeded to walk me through a scenario one day i might be off duty at 7 eleven or wawa getting food when someone tried to rob the store i will want to intervene by pulling out my gun to detain the criminal the cashier would call 911 and somehow in the heat of the moment my description would be confused with the perpetrators    so much so that the local cops would show up see me with a gun and shoot me his friends advice if anything like that ever happened i needed to put my gun down once i saw the red and blue lights pulling up lie on the ground with my arms extended let the cops handcuff me alongside the criminal and they will sort out who i actually was later this mcgregor wrote was the the black cop version of the talk to avoid getting killed by one of our own apparently it wouldnt matter that i wore a badge too    and even the gold fbi badge at that    i should expect to be treated like the same criminals i was empowered to arrest former nypd captain and now brooklyn borough president eric adams recalled participating in protests against stop and frisk by day and patrolling those protests at night the key lesson for police departments he wrote should be to choose carefully those officers whose temperament makes them best suited for de escalating situations that can turn violent and taking action against abuses is vital the history of complaints against derek chauvin before his encounter with george floyd is a painful reminder that a failure to remove bad officers often leads to fatal outcomes adams wrote if an officer displays any form of unprovoked aggression let alone wanton disregard for human life they should be held accountable phillip atiba goff co founder and chief executive officer of the center for policing equity wrote we starve the most vulnerable of services that could actually help we eliminate social services and job training we defund treatment for substance abuse and watch affordable housing vanish then we send law enforcement    the institution that was historically charged

protests quickly went international shining a light on current practices along with the legacy of imperialist history the statue of a slave trader in bristol england was toppled by protesters as holly thomas noted a very brief examination of the characters and associations behind some of londons most famous monuments reveals how many of our historys warts are not only omitted by plaques and commemorations but echoed in the racist views and expressions of britains leaders today sir winston churchill    prime minister boris johnsons hero and the countrys most celebrated wartime leader    was outspoken in his belief of white superiority uk historian richard toye author of a book on churchill and the british empire wrote that the man who led his nations fight against nazism in world war ii was indeed a racist but the matter is complicated portraying churchill as the root of all wickedness as some of the more extreme social media comments appear to do is as problematic as viewing him as the single handed savior of freedom and democracy toye argued by elevating him to a place of supreme importance    albeit by presenting him as uniquely wicked rather than splendidly virtuous    it reinforces churchills own theory of history as driven by great white men that is a vision from which surely we urgently need to break free not far from downtown atlanta georgia is a monument that has long been as controversial as statues of winston churchill became last week carved into stone mountain are giant depictions of confederate leaders the project was conceived in 1914 in the midst of the jim crow era and with eventual backing from members of the kkk which as george shepherd noted met on the mountains top to burn crosses after the supreme court outlawed segregation in public schools in 1954 southern states vowed a program of massive resistance part of the resistance was installing more white supremacist icons this was when the state of georgia purchased stone mountain finished the huge carvings    bigger than the presidents on mount rushmore    of two confederate military leaders stonewall jackson and lee and the political leader jefferson davis and added the confederate battle flag to georgias state flag this was not an innocent artifact of civil war history instead they were a middle finger both to african americans and to the federal government that was trying to end discrimination stone mountain was such an evil icon that rev martin luther king jr invoked it in his i have a dream speech its time to erase that and other confederate monuments as germany has done with the statues and public swastikas of the nazi era shepherd wrote on monday bubba wallace jr the only black full time driver on the nascar circuit called for the banning of confederate flags at car rallies and the organization swiftly agreed the elevation of the confederate flag and the corresponding raising of monuments to soldiers who should be considered war criminals betrays our nations

bryan monroe america needs white people to step up ana navarro 19 ways to fight racism the pandemic hasnt gone away it may have been overshadowed but the virus that causes covid 19 is still spreading and killing experts projected that anywhere from tens of thousands to more than 100000 americans could die in the remaining months of 2020 they worried that the advice to wear masks and continue social distancing to stop the spread could be ignored in the rush to reopen the economy debate continues over why some nations have seen much higher mortality rates than others dr kent sepkowitz noted clues may be emerging in early genetic research he observed but theres a danger in overemphasizing genetic factors a genetic predisposition can easily be mistaken as a death sentence but in many cases luck exercise and a good diet can still play a role in reducing the risk of disease sepkowitz wrote despite this its easy to imagine that the emphasis on genetics could take the heat off political leaders like president donald trump or brazils jair bolsonaro who have downplayed their responsibilities during this crisis how convenient it would be for them to be able to suggest that a disastrously managed highly lethal pandemic outbreak was actually nothing more than the result of the wrong genes in the wrong place at the wrong time april 22 was jose andrade garcias 62nd birthday

about states being ready for the challenge of more than 130 million americans voting during a pandemic enormous lines at georgia polling places in this weeks primary were a bad sign georgia was essentially a third world country tuesday wrote issac bailey citizens attempting to cast their votes in the states primary had to stand in line for several hours particularly those in areas with a higher percentage of black and brown residents many reasons emerged    none acceptable peter c goldmark jr and steven l isenberg wrote that the threat potentially posed to the election by hacking

max and cnn is owned by warnermedia wrote that the film romanticizes slavery as a benign and benevolent institution the highest grossing film of all time when adjusted for inflation it leaves out most of the cruel human costs of slavery she wrote some complained that taking the film down was a form of censorship for others seeing gone with the wind featured so prominently in hbo maxs launch felt like salt rubbed into wounds that have never been permitted to heal but it is precisely because of the ongoing painful patterns of racial injustice and disregard for black lives that gone with the wind should stay in circulation and remain available for viewing analysis and discussion hbo max is planning to eventually bring back the film with stewart offering an introduction placing the film in its multiple historical contexts with books on racism dominating the bestseller lists now she wrote this is an opportunity to think about what classic films can teach us  if people are really doing their homework we may be poised to have our most informed honest and productive national conversations yet about black lives on screen and off "

of a presidential administration the east wing emboldened by a first ladys global platform has been utilized for decades to help shore up a west wing strategy or put a continuation on a policy or even heal temperaments and rifts at times caused by the president yet as the summer of 2020 gets off to a historically chaotic start melania trump has maintained her normal routine of relative privacy her public statements calling for peace and healing amidst two weeks of protests in cities across the united states have been sporadic put out with the click of a send button on social media she has not made a public appearance in more than two weeks the most recent a visit to the pope john paul ii national shrine in washington dc where as she stood outside for a photograph with the president nudged by him to smile as noted in a video clip which she reluctantly did outside of that she has visited the federal emergency management agency headquarters to attend a briefing on hurricane preparedness which was a private meeting and had a session with educators about social emotional learning practices in education again a closed event the first ladys office did not respond to a cnn request for comment about any future events using a spotlight first ladies movements and actions have served to define a broader administration agenda in 1989 barbara bush used the spotlight to hold a baby who was hiv positive in the midst of the aids crisis in america a simple yet poignant gesture that from a first lady relayed the message of empathy and kindness for bush it was humanizing a disease that in the late 80s still felt unknown and scary to many americans her holding the baby helped remove the stigma at the time associated with hiv aids patients michelle obama traveled from washington to chicago to attend the funeral of hadiya pendleton a girl killed by gun violence in 2015 for obama simply attending pendletons funeral alone without president barack obama was making a statement as first lady about repeated senseless tragedies at the hands of guns growing exponentially in places such as chicago hadiya pendleton was me and i was her said obama drawing a personal connection to her own early years growing up on chicagos south side laura bush in the wake of 2005s hurricane katrina was forced to cope with both a human tragedy and a public relations mess left by george w bush criticized for his handling of the storm in its aftermath bush relied heavily on his wife to fix relationships in the storm ravaged areas laura bush visited new orleans 26 times post katrina by herself to try to ensure citizens living there that her husband and she was not going to forget the region she implemented assistance funding and a crucial spotlight using her platform as first lady melania trump has yet to meet with victims of coronavirus now months after the first cases were reported in the united states dual tragedies but coronavirus isnt the only force challenging american life right now the country also is finally facing a racial reckoning    years in the making    following the killing of george floyd at the hands of minneapolis police last month perhaps there was no other first lady from the past who has a more parallel path with what is happening today than claudia taylor lady bird johnson as america took crucial steps to desegregate the country with the passage of president lyndon johnsons civil rights act of 1964 lady bird sensed she should and could use her role to step in and help soothe a country grappling with change and unlike melania trump johnson was keen to do so in person knowing the power of her voice in the south could be all the more impactful than a letter writing campaign or even at an appearance alongside the president in october of 1964 lady bird johnson embarked on a solo whistle stop tour of the south in a customized train with a special caboose trimmed with a striped awning and a giant lady bird special sign she visited eight states in four days traveling from dcs union station to new orleans making 47 stops and speeches along the way the south was a place lady bird knew well having grown up in east texas and spent time as a child in alabama with family yet with the passage of the civil rights act by her husband the south was embroiled in change there was anger and frustration lady bird johnson put her life on the line in 1964 as the first first lady to campaign without her husband said kate andersen brower author of team of five the presidents club in the age of trump the civil rights act had infuriated voters lady bird was from the south and she spoke their language there were death threats but she persisted there were bomb threats and protesters signs saying black bird go home and chants of anger at every stop for as many supporters as showed up by the thousands to catch a glimpse of the five foot four inch 51 year old first lady with the lilting southern accent there was opposition need to heal mark updegrove presidential historian and president and ceo of the lbj foundation said johnson knew exactly what she was going to do she was walking into a hailstorm one of johnsons deepest concerns the entire trip updegrove said was the secret service train that traveled a few miles ahead of hers knowing full well if someone had indeed placed explosives on the tracks meant for her they would be met with them first it weighed heavily on her conscience he said but the drive of the first lady and her need to try to heal a country on the precipice of historic reform pushed her through and unlike the opposing sides of the current east and west wing messaging happening today in the trump white house lbj knew his wife was just what the country needed in that moment he had total faith in lady bird said updegrove who added that the entire tour was executed in plan and process by women luci and lynda the johnson daughters both traveled for parts and there were wives of senators and congressmen who joined lady birds press secretary also a woman    it was not just an intrepid and heroic act it was all conducted by women at a time when women were as marginalized as people of color who had been oppressed throughout the south lady bird was inspired by another important woman who broke the mold in the role of first lady eleanor roosevelt updegrove said she studied her she watched how eleanor was literally the legs for her husband when he needed her to be and that left an impact he said she was there to help advance his agenda to act for him in an ambassadorial way and that was key to how lady bird approached being first lady when it was her turn to do so its difficult to predict how history will view the tenure of melania trump but in the near term it doesnt seem that she is choosing to use her role to effect change even as millions of americans are in the throes of confusion and tumult melania trump has shown that she struggles to use one of the most important duties of being first lady brower said and that is to unify and console in times of crisis "

        "text": " \u2014 people are undoubtedly moving around more as vacation season heats up and patience for sheltering at home wears thin many travelers are sticking closer to home with short driving trips but air travel is on the rise more than 500000 people crossed through transportation security administration checkpoints at us airports on june 11 the first time numbers have climbed above that mark since the coronavirus pandemic brought travel to a near standstill in march anyone contemplating a trip has probably asked is it safer to fly or drive during the pandemic as with most things coronavirus theres no perfect answer it depends on the trip on your behavior and your risk tolerance the risks of travel are usually more dependent on the personal choices of the traveler rather than the means of transport said dr daniel griffin an infectious disease specialist at columbia university medical center stops to eat drink use the bathroom and sleep on long car trips add risk air travel presents its own challenges although the air in planes is filtered the mask usage and hygiene of your fellow passengers may be less than ideal griffin said the benefits of driving dr william schaffner infectious diseases specialist at vanderbilt university school of medicine believes driving has a leg up on safety when you drive you have much greater control of your own environment and the people around you and so i would think its safer to drive in the present time schaffner said even with restroom and fast food drive thru stops you can control your environment regarding the interaction with other people to a much greater extent than you can traveling on an airliner and of course whatever time you spend on the plane youre in a very enclosed environment with other people all of whom may not be wearing masks he said but schaffner also said if he needed to travel across country as cnn travel reader james armstrong did he would fly fly or drive a case study armstrong a single dad in san diego california recently wrestled with the fly or drive question for a trip to move his daughters belongings out of her dorm at west virginia university is it safer to take four flights  lasting 7 hours each way with up to 200 other passengers or is it safer to stay in at least three different hotels in three different states plus all the restaurant grocery store stops along the way armstrong wrote ultimately he and his daughter and two of his younger children flew across country taking two weeks off work for a cross country road trip wasnt viable for armstrong who is self employed he also wasnt convinced that all the interactions it would take to lodge and feed his family on the cross country trip would be any safer than flying we looked at it we weighed it we looked at the time we looked at the kids school obligations  and we just said were gonna bite the bullet well wear our masks well bring little swabs to clean things if we need to  and well wait it out for 14 days hoping nothing happens theyve been back for a little over two weeks now and theyre all symptom free armstrong said the family saw little enforcement of face covering requirements in airports or during their flights one flight skipped food and beverage service for safety concerns but the return flight offered that service one flight was less full but passengers were clustered closer to the front armstrong said bottom line social distancing and mask compliance on planes and in airports is uneven precautions to take whether you fly or drive either way wearing a mask when youre close to other people helps reduce risk that includes covering your face when you go through a drive thru on a road trip and keeping your mask on during a flight eating and drinking on a plane presents its own challenges when fliers arent able to sit six feet from passengers outside their cohort the more youre around unmasked people the riskier it gets so maybe you keep your mask on and forgo the drink but you dont want to get dehydrated said schaffner griffin agrees that eating or drinking in flight carries risk when people eat on planes they tend to touch their masks uncover their nose and mouth and potentially expose themselves and others he said keep interactions with other people to a minimum using electronic check in apps and packing your own food helps reduce face to face contact wash or sanitize your hands frequently and sanitize surfaces that others may have touched but perhaps most importantly make sure youre ok with the level of risk youre taking for the armstrongs air travel is worth the risk its like riding a roller coaster for the first time youre pretty scared but honestly after that youre like ok  said james armstrong ok enough for another flight yes armstrongs daughter flew cross country again this week her southwest flight was overbooked for social distancing and the airline repeatedly called to see if she would change her flight armstrong said she didnt but its another sign that theres no guarantee for social distancing on planes you cant anticipate exactly whats going to happen said schaffner so its very much your own sense of risk tolerance"

        "text": "ed adler is a partner in a global strategic communications firm he spent 36 years at time warner many of them as head of the companys corporate communications the opinions expressed here are his own read more opinion articles at cnn i was talking to a friend the other day about the pandemic and we were musing about when we could end our isolation now that the world is beginning to reopen prematurely amid rising infection numbers  i have been thinking especially of those of us in our 60s and older while the covid 19 virus attacks all ages we are among those at greatest risk what i realized is that we will not be back to normal for a long long time others will venture out my son 26 and daughter 22 will surely risk the threat of infection and try to resume some normalcy but for older folks and those with pre existing conditions our isolation must be ongoing we will be the last to resume activity and continue our lives and while we wait we can hear the echoes of those who care little about our vulnerability one example as the virus swept across the us a city official in antioch california said covid 19 should be allowed to run its course even if elderly and homeless people die ken turnage chairman of the citys planning commission posted on facebook that the country needed to adopt a herd mentality that allows the sick the old the injured to meet its natural course in nature turnage who later deleted the post refused to resign or retract his comments and was removed from his role but the remarks shook me not everyone expresses themselves as callously as turnage yet im equally appalled by those whove suggested the physically weak should be willing to sacrifice themselves for the future of the economy even dr mehmet oz seemed to incline to that view when in april he told fox news that school re openings were an appetizing opportunity because they may only cost us 2 to 3% in terms of total mortality he was citing an editorial in the lancet that said studies had shown school closures alone would reduce covid 19 deaths in the uk by only 2 to 4 percent according to the new york times oz has since said he misspoke but thats little comfort for me a member of the vulnerable older demographic    disproportionately dying from the disease \u2014 who would be sacrificed because of an impatience felt by some to open up the term culling of the herd is a euphemism for a dark strategy to kick start an economy severely damaged by lockdowns it also feels like a nice way of saying that my older friends and i could and some believe should be allowed to die translated that means we are like bovines who have bad meat and thus should be expendable to save all the other tasty cows and bulls the phrase is chilling and there is another ugly rancher influenced turn of phrase that is equally scary to me and my boomer cohorts its herd immunity herd immunity occurs when a high proportion of the population    an estimated 70% for covid 19    has developed immunity after exposure to the virus or through vaccination and the protection somewhat of the part of the population that is not immune the problem with allowing the virus to run rampant to achieve that however is that allowing that many exposures could also lead to countless complications and deaths worldwide    especially among the most vulnerable the herd immunity idea was a strategy of the swedish government to neutralize covid 19 in the early stage of the pandemic the concept was also floated by uk prime minister boris johnson as a way to reduce transmission both governments have since tempered their support for the strategy but that hasnt stopped the topic from permeating social media as for culling this has several meanings culling fruits means throwing out damaged pieces before the quality ones are shipped to the store    or thinning fruit trees to maximize their crops culling in terms of animal populations \u2014 humans for instance \u2014 entails hunting or slaughtering the weaker or sick animals to reduce herd numbers it feels like im starting to see that word more and more on social media but for people like me letting the virus run rampant in the hope of building herd immunity is scary and cruel the country is clearly divided many of the pro trump base are treating a potentially lethal virus not as science but as a political concoction of the left  some also dont believe in wearing masks and reject social distancing in a society that has always honored and been oddly enamored  of youth and the young it is not surprising that older folks are deemed disposable by some but im in my 60s and im still vibrant i enjoy working with clients to help them achieve their goals id like to be around to see my kids marriages and continue to help mentor their careers i want to hold grandchildren and play with walter my grand dog the folks who are my age and older will be more vulnerable to exposure as society re opens college and school students could spread the virus even as they are better able to shake it off for us our pre lockdown pleasures will be a distant memory while we feel our only option is to stay inside and pray for a cure a doctor friend of mine says it is simply darwinism and that only the strong will survive a religious friend says it is biblical im not expecting to be able to return to the new york city that i love for its energy its museums and because i was born here and raised my children here without any treatment or vaccine i fear that as activity returns i will only be able to wait in my apartment and go out alone in a disinfected elevator so i can walk around the block we must be aware that this might be the next phase in our nightmare other societies honor their elders ours needs to stop using callous phrases about culling them "

black lives matter movements signature black it was supposed to be a show of solidarity and of unity between a progressive website aimed at women and the movement instead it inspired a revolt in the ensuing days a number of former employees came forward on twitter to call out what they saw as hypocrisy on the part of the websites leadership especially when it came to matters of race and diversity the sites co founder and editor in chief christene barberich had repeatedly confused one black woman with another one said another tweeted that an executive once confused her with the caterer a third person said she was paid $15000 less than her two white coworkers who were doing the same job and within less than a week barberich was out of her job saying on monday she was stepping down to help diversify our leadership in editorial ashley c ford the former employee who said barberich used to confuse her for another black woman was one of the most prominent people who spoke out saying in one tweet that shed left refinery29 after nine months because of a toxic company culture where white womens egos ruled she was moved to tweet she told cnn business afterward by seeing a thread from another former employee ashley alese edwards when i started reading that thread and started seeing some of the responses to it the big thing that hit me was oh you idiot leaving didnt make anything stop  you left and they kept doing this they kept treating women like this they kept treating black women like this she said ford and edwards were not the only ones who spoke out or the only ones with disturbing stories to tell some sources who spoke to cnn business said there was a glaring lack of diversity at the company some said that despite the inclusive image that the site tried to present barberich made a number of editorial decisions that had the effect of diminishing minority and especially black women when barberich was approving photos for the site a former editor and a former executive photography director told cnn business she would reject some as off brand the pictures she rejected that way were consistently of women who were either black or plus size they said these two former employees said they knew the types of celebrities that barberich would approve to be included in refinerys coverage and that her decisions appeared to be based on race barberich loved solange knowles janelle mon\u00e1e was ok but otherwise our team knew which celebrities would get rejected the black ones the former editor said we kept pitching them anyway but it was a running and grim unfunny joke on our team wed say gee i wonder who will possibly get cut because we knew in response to this accusation barberich said in a statement my goal has always been to help close the representation gap and i believe that is reflected across the pages of refinery29 the former executive photography director said she repeatedly filed human resources complaints against barberich for her editorial choices but was told by an hr representative that it was not the companys job to manage barberich who reported to global president and chief content officer amy emmerich nancy dubuc the ceo of vice media group which owns refinery29 said in a statement to cnn business on thursday that vice was unaware of the toxic culture at refinery29 when it acquired the company it is unacceptable and we are grateful to all the people who bravely came forward to shed light on the situation she said dubuc added that vice is looking for a new editor in chief for the site and has put in place an immediate action plan to ensure that our workplace empowers diversity equity and inclusion inside our walls and reflects the brand purpose audiences have come to know us for in a lengthy statement responding to cnn business questions about her alleged actions barberich said she had co founded refinery29 to amplify and build community around women rarely seen or heard in media she acknowledged a personal failure to do that to the detriment of black women and women of color in particular saying i couldnt see how my own perspectives and privileges held back the changes that needed to be made to further that purpose and vision and to provide these women with the support they needed she continued to all those i let down especially members of my own team im deeply sorry the reason i stepped aside this week was to acknowledge that failing and to make space for a new editor in chief and a new generation of leadership at refinery29 who can forge a path with an even deeper commitment to our original mission when vice media announced last year that it was acquiring refinery29 dubuc sent a memo to staffers in which she acknowledged the seemingly mismatched company cultures vice is the notoriously edgy hipster outfit that was the subject of a 2017 new york times article exposing toxicity and sexual harassment scandals inside the company while refinery29 is a fashion site aimed at progressive women and promoting diversity and inclusion how can the bros ever mesh with the feminists of refinery she asked but 60 current and former refinery29 employees who spoke with cnn business over the course of a lengthy investigation painted a picture of a culture that actually fit quite well the issues at refinery29 were not limited to ones around race they said refinery29s official mission is for women to claim their power but the video team was led by a male manager who three former female staffers allege verbally abused them in public refinery29 promotes stories about self care but 23 employees said overly ambitious traffic demands made them feel chained to their desks and others said it kept them from taking vacations refinery29 tells women to ask for more money even publishing a book that dealt in part with the subject but 27 staffers said they were underpaid or restricted from raises when people talk about the cultures not meshing its astonishing to me because\u202ffrom\u202fwhat i can tell the cultures are very similar a former editor said a culture thats about corporate excess and workers being treated terribly thats refinery unbothered refinery29 had started as a fashion and beauty blog but over time it evolved into a site that included coverage of womens issues pay gaps and sexual harassment among other topics in 2016 it launched the 67% project a campaign to promote female representation of all shapes and sizes by highlighting the population of women who are defined as plus size money diaries a reader generated column challenged women to speak more openly about salaries and money management many of the sources who spoke to cnn business about their experiences at refinery29 said they had joined the company enthusiastic about being part of a brand dedicated to womens empowerment but once inside they were shocked by a workplace that seemed at odds with its public image walking around that office when i worked there it was very white very straight a former producer said that always bugged me its not what i expected its not that they didnt believe in the message but the talent needs to reflect the content they are producing nikki tucker a former social media editor said refinery was really touted as that millennial place of inclusivity where women are celebrated youre not shamed for your body it felt right up my alley as a black woman in america there arent really too many spaces for me to be at a place where inclusivity is celebrated \u2014 at least so i thought kristin booker a writer on contract at refinery29 in 2014 recalled that she was one of only a few black people in the office when she worked there ford worked at refinery29 in 2017 she would spend a lot of time in office late she said and the people who were most likely there still working  were black women when i talked to those women about how much money they were making and what their expectations were and what their relationship was like with their superiors it became very clear to me that i was being treated differently and i didnt want no part of that ford said in 2018 refinery29s staff was 69% white and 8% black according an internal diversity survey obtained by cnn business according to updated numbers provided by vice refinery29s staff as of june 9 2020 was 5442% white and 107% black these numbers are comparable to at least some of refinery29s competitors according to publicly released data in 2019 buzzfeed us staff was 77% black and vox media was 8% black among those who spoke out publicly about refinery29 last week were founding members of unbothered a sub brand for black women current and former staffers who spoke with cnn business frequently cited unbothered along with other similarly progressive inclusive work like the 67% project and the anti diet project as among the editorial projects they were most proud of and that were most celebrated internally but getting unbothered off the ground was a struggle according to its founders creating unbothered was a year long journey that led to the strongest community of black women i had ever seen at the company former senior social media editor alessandra hickson said in a statement to cnn business that she then posted on instagram over the weekend but it was also unfortunately one of the hardest years of my life thanks to a toxic culture that left me emotionally drained hickson wrote that she observed other colleagues usually black and brown women be subjected to tone policing pay disparity and open verbal abuse sesali bowen a former senior entertainment writer and a founding member of unbothered also spoke out online and in an email to cnn business i thought it was a privilege to be getting exposure and experience across different areas of the company i thought i was uniquely valued bowen wrote in the email in hindsight i believe i was being tokenized as a fat black woman and underpaid for my work bowen said barberich once ran her fingers through my hair as she complimented her new hairstyle\u202f cnn business corroborated this account with an eyewitness who said the incident happened out in the open where others could see in her statement on thursday barberich apologized for this saying i am truly sorry if this happened and if she felt uncomfortable in any way she also apologized for confusing ford with another woman i could have certainly called her the wrong name if i did i sincerely apologize she said publicly refinery29 touts the success of unbothered but several of its founding members told cnn business that the company initially had been resistant to the idea former producer ryen williams who was laid off in 2018 recalled frequent meetings she had with amy emmerich refinery29s chief content officer about the need for more content created by people of color eventually emmerich helped the founders settle on an instagram profile separate from refinery29s main account that became unbothered which has since grown to a full vertical with a newsletter and a tab on the site in addition to being segregated we were told that we wouldnt be given resources to create williams told cnn business after it took off  the company realized that unbothered could be monetized and thats when they started to care on thursday emmerich issued a statement about the launch of unbothered saying when we start new franchises we start small with a soft launch and ask ourselves what would resonate with the audience hickson was instrumental and the only full time staff with one freelancer however we used shared services from across the company    from photo design and video in 2018 hickson left    and since then unbothered has grown to 4 dedicated staff and 1 freelancer raven baker a former associate social media editor for unbothered said she left the company due to burnout she had repeatedly brought up to management concerns about low morale and team issues she said to which the company responded by changing staffers seat assignments unbothered is supposed to be a safe space for black women on the internet how is that when its not even a safe space in the workplace baker said unbothered continues to lack support at refinery29 several former and current staffers told cnn business that the instagram account is primarily run by an intern making $15 per hour emmerich sent a memo to staff on thursday apologizing to the many black women and poc who have spoken out about the unacceptable culture at refinery29 with courageous raw and painful stories about their experiences no qualifications no excuses    i am sorry she acknowledged that she let our audience down and vowed to be more present going forward even after the launch of unbothered barberich repeatedly made other editorial decisions that placed non white women in the background of the sites coverage or excluded them altogether in addition to the comments sources said she made about photos of women who were not thin and not white being off brand and the list of acceptable celebrities sources said she kept that included only black celebrities who are light skinned one former editor who spoke to cnn business said they had witnessed several instances in which barberich picked photos of white people over ones that included people of color because she said white faces drove more traffic another former editor and a former producer said they witnessed similar editorial decisions by barberich barberich allegedly made some of these decisions based on a b testing \u2014 a method used to compare two variations of the same content online to see which performs better with readers white faces always got more clicks than brown or tan faces which is the audiences doing not the companys yet the data always had the final say the former editor said the producer concurred saying most employees pushed very hard for diversity on the site the pace there was untenable before it became a digital media empire refinery29 started in 2005 as a niche fashion blog about independent shops in new york city its four cofounders    justin stefano philippe von borries piera gelardi and barberich    led it together until stefano and von borries who bore the titles of co ceos stepped away from day to day roles after the vice acquisition stefano and von borries on wednesday addressed the allegations in a post on the refinery29 website saying even though were no longer at the company as co founders and former co ceos at the end of the day the buck \u2014 and the culture \u2014 stopped with us after having read these accounts we recognize how our privilege as two white male ceos created blinders that kept us from seeing the struggles exclusion and aggressions that you felt at r29 this is an earthquake of a wake up call they said we wanted to create an inclusive environment but didnt spend enough time with team members listening to them and hearing their stories the company evolved into a rare haven for young women to be taken seriously said one former staffer women many in their twenties wrote about fashion and beauty in their own voices and attended some of the industrys most high profile events the brand really truly was on fire said annie tomlin a former beauty director i have so many emails from people wanting to get a byline or photo credit there brands and publicists were deeply interested in being my friend because i worked there it was the cool place to be but tomlin who started at refinery29 in 2012 said that on her first day she left the office in tears when she learned\u202fthe reality of the companys ambitious traffic goals she had 12 years of experience in media and saw herself as a very quick learner but she said the pace there was untenable i felt like i was thrown into the deep end tomlin told cnn business\u202f even if you were doing everything you could there were some factors that are beyond your control ten staffers who spoke to cnn business said managements relentless push for traffic was apparent in a constant stream of emails sent to the editorial teams to communicate how they were pacing relative to their goals a former refinery29 editor described the emails as quite impressive and thorough but added that every time i saw that email arrive my stomach would tighten because it could mean we suddenly had to scramble to make up for lost pageviews its not unusual for publications to push for traffic advertising revenue depends on bringing readers to a site hitting traffic goals can be the difference between a publications thriving or dying but former refinery29 staffers said they found themselves overworked by what they say were the companys overly ambitious traffic goals some of the staffers who spoke to cnn business said they saw traffic as a reflection of their own popularity three former writers said they would get reports that showed who was behind in hitting their traffic goals screenshots of articles were put up during meetings and names werent cropped out so you felt the failure personally a former writer said it sucked booker the writer who was on contract at refinery29 in 2014 nicknamed it the shame board one way that many sites keep a strong output of content to drive traffic is by picking up original reporting from other news outlets and rewriting it \u2014 known in the industry as aggregation another way is by monitoring trending stories from social media to see where readers interests are at any given moment these stories are often easy to produce requiring little or no reporting and yet driving a significant number of readers to a site but refinery29 wanted it both ways they wanted the fast trending stories but done as if they were another more labor intensive kind of article a former editor who spoke to cnn business said their team of three reporters was asked to produce 12 to 15 stories total per day each of these stories was supposed to include multiple interviews plus original photography or illustrations that workload would be daunting even for a seasoned newspaper beat reporter who on a typical day might produce just one or two stories the desire on the part of refinery29 to create beautifully packaged stories with original reporting was admirable but at least six former employees told cnn business that the pressure from all of it led to burnout booker said she typically wrote six to seven stories a day i wasnt used to the feeling of if i left my desk for longer than a few minutes somebody was going to come looking for me booker said if i wasnt at my desk looking like i was producing i had to have a damn good excuse it was terrifying similarly some staffers on the video team said they were under what they considered aggressive mandates for video views some producers would play refinery29 videos on a loop at their desks to increase views according to two former staffers on the video team in the pursuit of traffic refinery29 went from unearthing unique stories about fashion to chasing trending stories and celebrity news i used to describe refinery29 as vogue in the modern era after 2016 especially the last couple of years it became more about selling so our content watered downto a younger teen magazine said a former refinery29 designer jess rezendes a supervising story producer told cnn business that the day she realized that refinery29 was full of sh*t was when co founder gelardi sent an email to encourage staffers to write and generate traffic as a way to support a day without a woman a strike that took place in march 2017 to protest president trumps policies other female centric sites including bustle and teen vogue went dark for the occasion new york magazines culture site the cut also went on strike to support the cause gelardi did not ban staffers from participating in the strike but refinery29 kept publishing stories that day for rezendes the email was disingenuous and showed what she called refinery29s hypocrisy because she felt that it was self serving for the company to be producing content rather than striking refinery29 offered unlimited vacation as a perk but some writers say the push for traffic made taking time off nearly impossible according to five former writers editorial staffers had to prep a minimum of one story for every vacation day they took something not typically required of journalists in other newsrooms at least two people said that this policy prevented them from taking time off the hope was that writers could complete the extra work between the business hours of 930 am and 630 pm according to an internal email obtained by cnn business but that was not always possible according to the five former staffers one former writer said after taking one sick day due to an infection her manager asked her to double her output    meaning at least four stories    when she returned the next day toxic managers barberich wasnt the only manager at refinery29 who current and former employees accused of toxic behavior in interviews with cnn business there is also stone roberts who was hired from scripps in 2014 to help refinery29 increase its video output in a 2018 interview with forbes emmerich the chief content officer cited roberts as a great partner who helped pave the road so when i got here at refinery29 i could run refinery29 hired emmerich in january 2015 also from scripps to help build out the sites video production despite this high praise for roberts staffers on the video team said they felt demoralized by him three former staffers said he yelled at and insulted them in meetings when other employees were around two of those former staffers who were subjected to this abuse said he was vindictive when called out on it one of those staffers said he lost his temper and cursed at them this person said roberts later apologized by placing a bottle of hard alcohol on her desk and muttering sorry as he walked away to me it wasnt an environment thats actually fostering female empowerment it was fostering insecurity the staffer said roberts told cnn business in a statement through vice that he had received extensive management training and coaching between 2015 2016 to address these issues but at a routine video team meeting in 2017 three witnesses said roberts lashed out at the video team over an anonymous employee satisfaction survey about refinery29s workplace culture some staffers who took the survey told cnn business that they cited his behavior as a reason for their job dissatisfaction in a packed conference in the new york office roberts sits there and just tears into the entire team you guys destroyed me how could you do this to me a former staffer in attendance told cnn business a second former staffer who was at the meeting said we were all in there and he was clearly really upset and he addressed it and it was a weird vibe because it sucks to hear these things about yourself but at the same time how is this surprising in august 2017 roberts moved to los angeles to build out the video team according to reports thats the story we were all told a former staffer said whats not clear is whether roberts was reprimanded or punished for language his co workers found offensive he is now the senior vice president and head of global production & operations at vice studios roberts said in his statement that he moved to los angeles for family reasons money disparities refinery29 has covered the gender wage gap and offered strategies for women to ask for raises in fact refinery29 produced an editorial package the secret guide to getting more in december 2017 as a how to guide on salary negotiations it was billed as a first step toward asking for what you deserve but when nearly a dozen employees did exactly that they said they felt they were shut down one former writer told cnn business that around the same time the guide was published she was given a promotion but it was only in title here you are telling readers they should ask for more but youre giving me a promotion that is title only the former writer said the messaging we were constantly given is were family well take care of you were a family but thats not the way you treat your family a former designer at the company said she was rebuffed when she took her pay disparity complaint to human resources after she learned that a male colleague in a similar role made more than she did another former writer said their manager offered a raise only to revoke it later without providing a reason a former editor said she tried and failed to secure a raise for a writer to match the salary of another writer with similar experience who was making $14000 more a former female employee said she had to threaten legal action in order to secure a raise to match what a male colleague in the same role was making at the top level when i tried to fight this they were all women and no one really paid any attention to it how is this possible here the former designer said megan mcintyre a former beauty director said she discovered she had been making at least $30000 less than her friends in similar positions at other publications when she asked for a larger raise than the $5000 bump from a promotion she was turned down the response at the time was along the lines of we cant give you this kind of raise because then wed have to let other people go mcintyre said thats the thing where they spent too much money and now they cant afford to pay you what youre worth refinery29s biggest cash infusion came in august 2016 through a $45 million funding round led by turner a relationship that meant refinery29 could expand its video footprint cnn was a division of turner an entity that now operates under the umbrella of at&ts warnermedia which owns cnn refinery29 held a champagne toast to celebrate that meeting felt like nothing could stop us that our content was going to be on tv and refinery29 was going towards world domination said a former refinery29 designer in december 2017 refinery29 laid off 34 employees about 75% of its workforce and the company shifted to focus on growth engines including long form scripted and unscripted video after those layoffs refinery29 employees began talking about unionizing to address the problems at the company\u202f\u202fin january 2019 a few months after refinery29 laid off dozens more people 40 members of the editorial staff unionized with the writers guild of america east in december refinery29 staffers agreed to be covered under vices union vices contract establishes salary minimums which have been crucial in bringing those who were underpaid    including most of our writers editors contractors and freelance writers    up to industry standards leah carroll a member of refinery29s labor management committee said in a statement in may we also were able to secure annual cost of living wage increases and standardized job descriptions across the unit carroll was one of at least 10 refinery29 staffers who was laid off in june when vice media cut 155 jobs due to the economic fallout of the pandemic for one former editor her frustration over refinery29s pay disparity stemmed from what she saw as the companys wasteful spending on the free snacks kombucha on tap happy hours and extravagant holiday parties she saw when she worked there wed hear how successful the company was how we were profitable and bringing in revenue and getting these massive advertising deals the former editor said it was hard to see and hear like theres all this money but you cant have any "

racism that is woven into the fabric of our criminal justice system the city of minneapolis is pursuing a new model of policing  this is a bold and risky decision but in some ways they have no other choice the system we have today is broken puts lives at risk and must be fixed more modest efforts to reform the police department have fallen woefully short  we can build a better more equitable and accountable system of justice in our country  we can change american policing i am certain of this because i have seen it happen  camden a city of nearly 80000 had been repeatedly named the most dangerous city in america when i was sworn in as new jerseys attorney general in 2007 repeated efforts to reform the department had failed over the years leaving people understandably skeptical of new leaders with old promises no one including me was convinced at that time that a new way could be found  during my first ride along observing the workday of camdens patrol officers i saw many things a child who should have been sitting in a schoolroom selling drugs in broad daylight abandoned buildings and parks and playgrounds that were completely empty devoid of any life and all around me faces of residents in the community that met mine with despair and distrust as we drove through the streets in an unmarked police car  the one thing that i did not see that day was a single police officer on the streets of camden sirens wailed in the background and a police cruiser flew by on the highway with lights and sirens blaring but on the streets of the most dangerous city in america there was not a single police officer in sight  my team and i tried to understand what was happening we went to a compstat meeting where we expected to see senior police leaders using statistics on crimes and officer deployments to make the city safer instead we saw senior officer after senior officer stand up and say last week we had a shooting here and point to a spot on the city map or last week we had a robbery and each time they finished they put a yellow sticky note on the wall where the crime had occurred saying no leads at the end of more than two hours we had a map filled with yellow sticky notes and no idea of how to stop the bloodshed  we had a police department that had no idea of what it was doing or whether it could do better it lurched wildly from 911 call to 911 call sometimes taking hours to respond to calls of serious violence it failed to solve serious crimes    rapes robberies murders    that plagued the city and yet hundreds of arrests were being made for low level crimes driven most often by drug and alcohol addiction mental illness poverty and homelessness this created a never ending cycle of arrest and incarceration that left the once great city torn apart and did nothing to stop the horrific violence  and there was almost no police accountability on any level to the people of camden there was no accountability internally to discipline officers who broke rules there were serious allegations of police abuse and criminal activity including allegations of stealing and planting drugs that led to federal criminal charges against five officers there were also racial tensions between the mostly white police force and the camden community 90% of which is non white  the department was operating at that time under a failed old school approach to policing anecdotes of prior arrests and crimes became the basis for decisions about how to run the department the department did not collect or use data instead it operated solely upon the gut and hunches of its leadership which were most often wrong it lacked formal systems and processes to ensure they were acting fairly and with integrity toward members of the community  the city and the police department were deeply broken what drove me forward during my deepest despair and uncertainty was the children who were killed in the summer of 2007 just five days after i was sworn in as attorney general 12 year old pee wee coleman was gunned down execution style in branch village with more than 20 bullets from an ak 47 assault rifle in the summer of 2008 4 year old brandon thompson was running to his mother when he was killed by gunfire from a mac 10 submachine gun during a turf battle between rival drug dealers  this horrific unthinkable violence drove me and my senior leadership team to conclude that the police department had to be completely reinvented with two core operating pillars necessary to create a foundation from which a better police force and better city could emerge  the first pillar was accountability we began to hold ourselves accountable    both within the department and to the community we served  in the summer of 2008 just one year after me and my team started we changed the way we policed the city we took officers out from behind desks and put them on the street we changed the way we dispatched officers to answer 911 calls we demoted officers who did not show the integrity needed to inspire the trust of those they were sworn to protect we fired others who broke the rules we dismantled specialty units that worked as overtime machines to pad the salaries of a handful of officers we instituted new ways to track compliance with rules and discipline and we leveraged the existing suspension of civil service rules to promote a young innovative deputy chief scott thomson to be the interim police chief chief thomson had only 14 years on the job and in most other police departments in america would not have been eligible for the position we didnt care he was the right person for the job  second we engaged deeply and continuously with the community we went to church meetings and community groups to hear about residents needs and concerns we asked what public safety meant to the community we asked the community to be our partner we assigned officers to walk the streets in neighborhoods including 50 new officers who we hired we shut down open air drug markets we identified and prosecuted the small but critical group of people who were responsible for much of the violence  none of this was easy we pulled data from handwritten files locked away in old filing cabinets to understand what was happening we designed a new 911 system and built a compstat model at first by hand we secured funding to build critical technology within the department which would allow us to collect information in real time to hold ourselves accountable  and we pushed back against all the political efforts inside and outside the department that were fighting to maintain the old status quo we made many enemies and made very few friends  because tinkering around the edges would fail we rebuilt the camden police department from the ground up  and it worked  one year later we had dropped murders by 40% police officers were in the community walking the streets children were playing in the parks and while violence and crime were still too high and we had many setbacks we proved within one year that the city could be made far safer for all residents we showed that the police could change and be accountable to the city and that a viable and sustainable alternative to the policing policies and practices that had failed the people of camden for decades could be found  this didnt take decades it took a year of unwavering dedication to a difficult task by a lot of good and decent people who were as fed up then as so many people around the country are today  before i left office in 2010 we returned the police department to the city of camden and i formally tapped scott thomson to serve as chief of police  although camden was on the rise the fragility of that progress was shown when the next governor slashed state funding for the city overnight the police department had to fire 163 police officers including because of union contracts the 50 new ones that were so critical for culture change crime rose again skyrocketing from 34 murders after we had implemented our reforms in 2009 to 67 murders after the budget cuts in 2012 just as suddenly as it had fallen crime surged back up and the culture of the department began to slide back to where it had been before  the one thing that was very different three years later was that camden residents had seen a new model of policing where public safety accountability and community went hand in hand they knew what was possible and they wanted it back  and so in 2013 the city of camden made the extraordinary decision to disband its police department and form an entirely new county wide department it did not eliminate law enforcement rather it reimagined a new police department that prioritizes public safety accountability and community and it institutionalized the reforms free from budget cuts and restrictive contracts needed to fully shift the culture  from the ashes of hard fought reforms a new stronger police department emerged out went the failed contracts which restrained the ability of the leadership to hold officers accountable and limited how the department could be staffed and run in came data and technology systems that we had built to track progress and measure results  perhaps most importantly this new department doubled the number of police officers    officers hired with an eye toward the future rather than the past  after a short detour the change we began in 2008 became the foundation for a new better police department  chief thomson led the department until 2019 with the mantra that the police are guardians not warriors today more than a decade after we began our reform efforts camdens guardians have made the city the safest that it has been in more than 50 years it is a model agency for community policing violence and crime reduction use of force policies and above all for accountability  this is not to say that every single police department in america must disband or that a new model of equitable public safety can only be achieved if built from the ground up but for many cities and towns building a new public safety department from scratch will be the right choice if culture contracts and funding impede true reform communities will have no choice but to build anew communities should never have to choose between public safety and equity and they do not have to as protests have taken place across our country in the wake of george floyds murder i have been deeply moved by the sight of camden officers marching arm in arm with the people of the city to protest police brutality and racism if you had told me all those years ago that i would see the most dangerous city in america defy all of the odds    overcome the stops and starts    and become safe peaceful and willing to walk in solidarity with the police i would not have believed it  and i would have been wrong "

floyds killing the movement for black lives    already a massive global force    has succeeded in birthing a phenomenon infinitely larger than itself it can only be called a great awakening of empathy and solidarity one without historical precedent  once feared dismissed and reviled black lives matter has suddenly become one of the worlds most beloved brands with exponentially growing support its protests have quickly grown into a cultural tsunami that is sweeping through media the academy houses of worship hollywood and even corporate board rooms  this new building force may someday change the course of world history in many ways it already has  in the context of an otherwise divided and fractured us a new continent of common ground has emerged many more white americans now accept that anti black racism is a real and present danger for large numbers of people the idea that racism is over is now itself over  many more white americans understand that our policing and criminal justice systems are systemically unfair to african americans  and many more white americans want to do something about it    even if they dont know exactly what  this sudden mass realization    and the multi racial demonstrations that give it weight life and substance    feels like a miracle to me as a black man i have spent my entire life trying to convince relatively small numbers of white people to take racial injustice seriously i have usually failed  now major corporations are making my argument for me hundreds of thousands of white protestors are risking their lives in the middle of a pandemic to chant black lives matter and i have begun to believe that    just maybe    the world for my two black sons might actually be a better place  the swing from despair to hope has been disorienting two weeks ago everyone i know was disgusted and despondent    having watched a white police officer kill a black man named george floyd in broad daylight the sad truth is that sneering white men have strangled black people to death in this country for centuries the practice was so widespread that civil rights hero bryan stevenson built a massive monument in montgomery alabama to memorialize the victims of this grisly practice  but this time a captive audience of millions of americans    stuck indoors during the covid shutdown    bore witness to the horrific deed on their cell phones all at the same time as the video went viral the horror and injustice of this incident touched the consciousness of humanity and now the world is making its revulsion known  there is no official name for the protest wave that is sweeping the globe but this awakening has already racked up a long list of achievements  here are a few  the policeman who killed george floyd was fired arrested and charged with third degree murder and second degree manslaughter later he was also charged with second degree murder the other three cops involved have been charged with aiding and abetting second degree manslaughter and aiding and abetting second degree murder  police departments and cities from california to france have instituted bans on chokeholds alongside other efforts meant to enhance transparency and swift action against misconduct  numerous companies are issuing statements and pledging donations including ben and jerrys which made one of the most powerful statements in the private sector in line with its previous bold statements  target also aligned itself with the cause despite one of its stores being torched in minneapolis  michael jordan has promised he will donate $100 million to support racial justice advocacy over the next 10 years  warner music issued a similar promise to donate $100 million to social justice causes  sony music has likewise pledged $100 million to social justice causes  public perceptions of policing and race have quantifiably experienced a dramatic shift according to a recent washington post poll three out of

discussion about police demilitarization  the mayor of los angeles announced that the citys police budget would be cut by $100 150 million the funds would be reinvested into programs that serve communities of color  los angeles is also instituting a moratorium on adding new names to the citys gang database which is under investigation for misuse  a veto proof majority in the minneapolis city council pledged to disband the citys police department  congresswoman ayanna pressley d ma and congressman justin amash l mi introduced a bipartisan bill that would end qualified immunity a legal doctrine that makes it difficult to sue police officers over rights violations  the representatives of all 30 major league baseball teams issued a statement in support of the black lives matter movement  furthermore the players coalition gathered more than 1400 signatures from current and former athletes coaches general managers and team staff from the nfl nba and mlb for a letter to congress supporting the end of qualified immunity  black women leaders are taking over white celebrities instagram accounts to #sharethemic and hold space for antiracist discussions  the marines and

filed by sen elizabeth warren that would change the names of all military bases named after confederate generals  black authors topped the new york times bestsellers list indicating the deep sense of urgency to hear and learn from their voices  some enlisted soldiers and veterans have openly decried the possibility that they could be deployed to repress protests in american streets  the city of atlanta issued charges against the six officers who assaulted two young black people at a recent protest and shot them with stun guns  the two buffalo police officers who pushed an elderly man during a protest knocking him to the concrete and according to his lawyer causing a brain injury have been arrested and charged  mitt romney marched with protesters and proclaimed on television that black lives matter  pope francis did not mince words on the murder of george floyd in a public address encouraging the anti racism protesters  young people especially generation z activists are out on the streets in small towns and big cities using platforms like tiktok and instagram creatively to amplify the movement so it feels omnipresent  protests are breaking out in towns that are small and that are older whiter and more conservative than average support in unlikely places demonstrates the unique significance of this moment  the mayor of louisville has suspended the citys controversial no knock warrants that allow police to burst into homes without notice at any time of the day the initiative is tentatively called breonnas law in honor of breonna taylor the african american emergency medical technician wrongly shot and killed while she slept during one of these raids  in denver a judge issued an order restraining the use of tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters  new york

censorship hbo max    which like cnn is owned by warnermedia    has pulled the film gone with the wind from its library given its portrayal of enslavement and racial prejudice a spokesperson said that when the film returns to hbo max it will return with a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions and will be presented as it was originally created because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed  paramount media canceled the show cops after 30 years of glorifying police violence and stereotyping people of color  the fox

enforce its crackdown on unlicensed food vendors  organizers of the los angeles pride parade have announced that this years parade will be devoted to a black lives matter protest  organizers of indianapolis pride have announced that police will no longer be invited to pride events  people with internet access but no money to donate figured out a way to support the movement by streaming music on this youtube channel which provides ad revenue to activists who run it  conversations about defunding and even abolishing police are now being held in unusual and unexpected places including among typically apolitical white folks who are fed up with the status quo  statues honoring the cause of enslavement and colonialism have been toppled by local government or public activism in virginia alabama maryland and london england  and a lot of other things which my twitter followers have been telling me all about  most of these events were unimaginable just one month ago these monumental achievements are the results of an ongoing uprising of millions of people against a racist status quo in this country and around the world  tens of millions of americans are out in the streets protesting for a better way forward confronting inequity and turning discomfort into action because of their efforts there is a new consensus emerging the black folks who have led this movement many of whom are young people are literally changing the world    right before our eyes  adults often rolled our eyes in frustration at the new generation accusing them of being too woke but the woke laid the groundwork for the great awakening "

this commentary belong to the author view more opinion at cnn all living organisms mutate and adapt to maximize survival in their ecologic niche for months scientists have been looking into whether the novel coronavirus    known as sars cov 2    is mutating and becoming more transmissible or more lethal recent evidence points to a preliminary answer to half the question yes a study has found that the virus has mutated and the dominant strain today is now capable of infecting more human cells but the scientists say more research is needed to show whether this changed the course of the pandemic and it remains unclear whether this mutation is more lethal almost immediately after the outbreak emerged researchers began looking for patterns of change among the tens of thousands of viral genome sequences of sars cov 2 the search was made possible thanks to the willingness of researchers around the world to upload their data to a common database the data is open source meaning anyone with a computer can access and analyze the data the alert that a change in the genome of sars cov 2 was afoot first emerged from researchers skilled in the art of deciphering the messages encoded in the genome of hiv 1 the virus that causes aids the ability to find meaning in over one billion bits of such information has been honed by decades of research on the ever changing genomes of hiv 1 which can make a life or death difference in how the virus responds to antiviral drugs once you know the tale the genomes tell you can choose which drugs to use to treat a specific strain of the virus the researchers studying the sars cov 2 genome first noticed that one mutation known as d614g dominated all others it first appeared in february as a rare variant in europe before spreading and overtaking other strains in italy and other countries the research team quickly identified a single change in the virus genome the mutation affects the spike protein on the outer surface of the virus for which the coronavirus is named the latin word corona means crown or halo the spike is of special importance in the life of the virus since it is the mechanism that allows the virus to recognize and attach itself to a host cell before infecting it the original authors speculated that the change improves the ability of the virus to stick tightly to mucous membranes in the nose or eyes to begin the process of infection the original report was met with skepticism some asked whether the dominance of this new strain was the result of an unrelated phenomenon given that the researchers had been relying only on publicly available data and computer analyses of the genome they were unable to definitively conclude that their idea was the only reasonable explanation for the emergence of the new dominant strain until now the scripps research institute in florida answered this question in an unreviewed research manuscript published friday the researchers used an elegant set of methods to show that one small mutation stabilized the spike protein which typically sheds from the surface of the virus the mutation had the effect of markedly increasing the number of functional spikes on the viral surface senior author hyeryun choe said the number    or density    of functional spikes on the virus is 4 or 5 times greater due to this mutation the result each mutant virus particle has an increased ability to infect target cells this study clearly shows the virus is evolving it also found the mutation was nearly 10 times more infectious in a laboratory setting than other strains with genomic analyses showing that this strain has become the dominant one the findings could explain why the novel coronavirus has spread so widely in europe the united states and latin america does more transmissible mean the strain is more lethal not that we can observe as of now from the perspective of the virus and its capacity for survival it is better to allow those who have been infected to live and spread the virus rather than die is this the end of sars cov 2s evolution not by a long shot doctors in northeastern china have noted that patients in a new cluster of cases appear to carry the virus for a longer period of time and take longer to test negative they also found that patients were taking longer to show symptoms after infection the virus could be mutating to become more persistent as another way to survive since those who carry the virus for a longer period have more opportunities to infect others understanding the biochemical basis for this change will be fascinating last month a pair of manuscripts examined variants in one of the sars cov 2 proteins specified by the orf3b gene which suppresses part of our immune response to virus infections one particular variant of orf3b does so more effectively than the original which may give the virus more time to replicate in the absence of an effective immune response a sicker patient may be the result as of this week sars cov 2 has infected more than 76 million people thats remarkable for a virus that very likely began with the infection of a single person roughly six months ago sars cov 2 has now had seven million more chances to adapt to its new human ecosystem and there are hints that the virus is doing a good job of it we know from our experience with many viruses like hiv 1 and influenza that we are not facing a static foe the novel coronavirus is changing as we struggle to control the pandemic sars cov 2 has already proven to be a formidable adversary while our success today    though arguably limited    is important we should not lose sight of the long battle against microbe that lies ahead "

she is director of the arts + public life she is the author of migrating to the movies cinema and black urban modernity and co editor of la rebellion creating a new black cinema tcm cnn and hbo max share the same parent company warnermedia the views expressed here are hers read more opinion on cnn just before the covid 19 quarantine i joined my fellow hosts on turner classic movies for an old hollywood fashion photo shoot for emmy magazine but when the spread came out i could not bring myself to post the photos to my social media as an african american cinema and media studies professor how could i promote the glamour of classic hollywood when our current media landscape was exploding with scenes of racial crisis day after day i scrolled through posts decrying the killings of ahmaud arbery breonna taylor and george floyd for weeks video after video showed the escalating protests against police brutality and the brutal treatment of protesters by police it seemed inappropriate to share shots glorifying hollywoods golden age in this moment of mourning and mobilization moreover the classic films we showcase on turner classic movies tcm have played a major role in perpetuating the racist beliefs that devalue black lives and normalize the use of excessive force against black people no wonder that many viewers were outraged when hbo max rolled out with the civil war romance gone with the wind on its roster hbo max has temporarily pulled the film with the intent to return it to their service with additional historical context originally released in 1939 the film romanticizes slavery as a benign and benevolent institution still the highest grossing film in history when adjusted for inflation gone with the wind continues to have a profound impact on the ways mainstream audiences visualize the antebellum south and the reconstruction period that followed the civil war there have been many highly visible efforts to represent slavery on screen from more historically accurate african american perspectives from the 1977 miniseries roots to oprah winfreys beloved 1998 to steve mcqueens 12 years a slave 2013  but gone with the wind endures in popular culture it is an account of slavery devoid of the physical abuse save vivien leighs scarlett oharas legendary slap of butterfly mcqueens prissy the grueling labor and the separation of families over the decades gone with the wind has seen many theatrical re releases featured presentations on prime time network television and spectacularly packaged home video editions it was the very first film shown on turner classic movies when the network premiered in 1994 and then this behemoth of classic films clocking in at nearly four hours made the leap into the world of on demand streaming some complained that taking the film down was a form of censorship for others seeing gone with the wind featured so prominently in hbo maxs launch felt like salt rubbed into wounds that have never been permitted to heal these wounds are reopened with every act of anti black violence every delay in justice and every failure to acknowledge the extent of black suffering but it is precisely because of the ongoing painful patterns of racial injustice and disregard for black lives that gone with the wind should stay in circulation and remain available for viewing analysis and discussion gone with the wind is a prime text for examining expressions of white supremacy in popular culture based on margaret mitchells blockbuster novel gone with the wind taps into longstanding myths about the gentility of the antebellum south the films lavish costumes magnificent plantation sets and sweeping technicolor cinematography render scarlett oharas romances and economic tribulations in grand melodramatic fashion as the title indicates gone with the wind looks back nostalgically at idyllic days that are no more because they never were by harkening back to the great old days plantation dramas invite white viewers to imagine appealing but false pedigrees when working class and poor white viewers identify with a noble white lineage for example they might be less likely to form what could be beneficial alliances with their black working class and poor counterparts the film is also a valuable document of and testimony to black performance during an era when substantial roles for black talent were extremely rare in hollywood films as film historian donald bogle has argued the extraordinarily talented black actors in gone with the wind    particularly hattie mcdaniel in her oscar winning performance as mammy and butterfly mcqueen as the comically inept prissy    bring notable humanity to their stereotypical roles too often these characters are deemed either harmless or harmful mammy and prissy are often read either as benign features of a movie that merely reflects its times or as victims of hollywoods longstanding pervasive racism however when we look carefully at their acting styles we see how mcdaniel and mcqueen nuance their characters with their unique facial expressions gestures vocal inflections and brands of humor they steal the show to borrow the phrase scholar miriam petty uses to describe how black actors in classic hollywood films maximize the impact of their minimal roles at the same time gone with the wind illustrates how trenchant racism has restricted black possibilities as well as the efforts of well meaning white allies producer david o selznick supported hattie mcdaniels nomination for an academy award believing in the strength of her performance but he capitulated to southern sensibilities when he did not include black cast members at the films premiere in atlanta and at the 12th academy awards ceremony where she became the first black actor to win an oscar mcdaniel did not sit at selznicks table with the rest of the cast she had to be given special permission by management to enter the whites only cocoanut grove club and was seated at a small table on the side of the room a spokesperson for hbo max noted in a statement that the films racist depictions were wrong then and are wrong today and we felt that to keep this title up without an explanation and a denouncement of those depictions would be irresponsible  as the current debates about putting up taking down and contextualizing gone with the wind make clear it is a film that continues to expose deep fissures in our interpretations of american history film history and the relationship between the two the film has loyal fans and it has vocal critics who critique its version of southern history with the same language black activists used when they picketed the film 80 years ago but as i saw at a jam packed panel discussion on the complicated legacy of gone with the wind at the 2019 tcm classic film festival there are people who love the film and others who love to hate it and still others who are nonetheless curious about how other folks respond to it hbo max will bring gone with the wind back to its line up and when it appears i will provide an introduction placing the film in its multiple historical contexts for me this is an opportunity to think about what classic films can teach us right now people are turning to movies for racial re education and the top selling books on amazon are about anti racism and racial inequality if people are really doing their homework we may be poised to have our most informed honest and productive national conversations yet about black lives on screen and off "

make the dramatic break that would signal that someone is ready to stand as the leader of the post trump republican party i would nominate for this job vice president mike pence unprecedented pretty much but the trump era is unprecedented too and pence signaled when he agreed that he would be trumps running mate that hes willing to do the unexpected at this point as president trumps support weakens pence should weigh the merits of declaring he wont be vice president for a possible second term theres an argument that pences status in trumpworld might be endangered anyway if the president continues to trail joe biden by double digits in the polls this summer and if the democratic contender picks a woman of color for his running mate he could be tempted to shake up his ticket by selecting nikki haley or another candidate for vp such a move could bring back some of the white suburban women trump needs to win re election and remind everyone that hes not a typical politician if we cast our minds back to the distant feeling summer of 2016 we can see that trump was repellent to many mainstream republican leaders who considered his ugly way of talking and his record of scandal    many involving allegations of sexual misconduct    and stood at arms length who would have imagined then that a puritanical governor of indiana who refused to lunch alone with a female colleague and according to rolling stone called his wife mother would harness himself to the thrice married often bankrupted trump although others were confused when pence made his fateful decision  it affirmed what many hoosiers long knew behind that mild mannered persona lurks a savvy and opportunistic politician pence was at the time when trump came calling a not so popular governor of a mid sized state with grand ambitions as reported in my co authored biography of pence he had first voiced white house dreams as a youngster in addition to his big dreams pence possessed a certain knack for understanding how modern republican politics worked two failed runs for congress in 1988 and 1990  led him to a long stint as a radio and tv personality where he fashioned himself as rush limbaugh on decaf or someone who was conservative but not angry about it as his announcing gigs helped him hone his speaking style the reactions he heard from listeners and viewers helped him understand the blend of right wing christianity and conservative politics that could be potently effective in small town and rural america when he was ready to get back into politics his pro business stands made him attractive to donor organizations like the club for growth which helped him fill a winning war chest later came backing from the deep pocketed conservative koch brothers whose imprimatur almost certainly made like minded gop donors take notice of pence well established as a christian right political figure who was an extremely effective fundraiser the only cloud hovering over pence in 2016 was at home in indiana where mistakes and missteps threatened his future trumps offer gave him a graceful exit    far better to move on than be defeated    and a longshot chance at higher office the bet paid off as veep pence has combined abject loyalty and frequent well timed absences to stay in trumps good graces while avoiding many controversies he didnt win a truly high profile assignment until after the administrations big early mistakes were made he was named head of the coronavirus task force hes distinguished himself from trump by speaking calmly getting along with the nations governors and working hard and by ceding center stage whenever the president wanted it he also avoided becoming the focus of critics last week as the country  erupted in protests following the death of george floyd pence was not present when federal officers brutally cleared away demonstrators and the president walked to st johns church and wordlessly hoisted a bible to signify something about his leadership pence was also absent when on the next day trump performed a similar display at the saint john paul ii national shrine the pandemic and tide of anti racism sentiment has revealed the limitations of the president as a leader and of his law and order posturing with the election less than five months away trump is in grave danger of losing his bid for a second term this may be why weeks ago the republican senatorial campaign committee urged its candidates to for their own good limit the praise they heap on the incumbent with party stalwart colin powell announcing he will support trumps opponent joe biden and many others reportedly leaning that way an opening is available for someone with a keen sense of where the political winds blow a strong instinct for self advancement resources of his own and a proven willingness to surprise conditions are perfect in other words for mike pence to observe that either he needs to spend more time with his family or believes the president would benefit from the excitement that would come were he to run with a fresh face    perhaps former south carolina gov nikki haley    beside him pence could resign saying trump is just too loyal to fire him and graciously make a path for himself to become the new leader of the gop come the defeat of the trump haley ticket in november "

        "text": "dozens of scantily dressed filipina croupiers stand in booths shuffling cards in front of a webcam their faces softly illuminated by professional lighting nearby rows of chinese nationals sit at desks chatting on cellphones with potential clients back in china this is what a typical pogo    or a philippine offshore gaming operator    looks like according to descriptions provided to cnn by several gaming experts some are based in abandoned malls while others are found in converted parking lots or cheap rented offices they say in the past three years the philippines has emerged as a major hub for online gaming according to filipino officials  attracting more than 100000 chinese nationals who work in virtual casinos catering to players back in china where gambling is illegal they have been both a boon and a curse for the country the online casinos generate tax revenue and desperately needed jobs in manilas crowded downtown area but at the same time theyve pushed up rents and created new challenges for the philippine national police in the past year beijing has ratcheted up pressure on manila to shut down the industry following its success in convincing cambodia to move toward doing the same last year manila stopped taking applications for new pogo licences in august 2019 citing concerns about national security but president rodrigo duterte said the next month that he would not ban the industry we decide to benefit the interest of my country he said i decide that we need it in may duterte allowed the pogos to reopen after two months of closure due to the covid 19 pandemic effectively endorsing them as essential businesses philippines casino boom online gaming platforms allow players to gamble remotely they sign up choose a game and it is played over a livestream in another jurisdiction the games offered on these platforms are dictated by asian tastes where most of the demand comes from said brendan bussmann from global market advisors a las vegas based consulting firm specializing in the gaming sports entertainment and hospitality industries there is a lot of baccarat as well as some sic bo a chinese dice game and blackjack said bussmann the amounts wagered tend to be low in the range of $5 to $100 he said manila has become the number one hotspot worldwide for online gaming in front of malta the isle of man and curacao according to david lee a lawyer at taiwanese firm lin & partners who specializes in gaming laws the philippines pioneered online casinos in the early 2000s when cagayan a province to the north of the country started awarding licenses to a handful of operators explains ben lee the founder of igamix a macao based consultancy firm focused on the gaming industry in asia but they really took off in 2016 when president rodrigo duterte came into office duterte handed the right to issue offshore gambling licenses to the philippine amusement and gaming corporation pagcor a government entity that operates casinos and regulates the industry it began to aggressively develop the industry by awarding dozens of licenses said lawyer david lee chinese businessmen were quick to seize the opportunity and the number of pogos mushroomed there are now 60 licensed offshore gaming operators in the philippines according to pagcor they are assisted by several hundred service providers who help them build and maintain the infrastructure behind their platforms according to ben lee of igamix consultancy many of these service providers also act as an interface between the pogos and their customers renting a video feed from the officially licensed operators and overlaying their logo and visual identity onto it he added some 90% to 95% of pogo customers are located in china he said this is illegal chinese laws ban any form of gambling by its citizens including online and overseas laws in the philippines also ban online casinos from marketing their services to citizens of a country where gambling is illegal according to lawyer david lee but this rule is ignored by most pogo operators and poorly enforced according to several experts a spokeswoman for industry regulator pagcor said new regulations were introduced in august 2016 to curtail the proliferation of illegal online games and to ensure they are properly regulated she added that pogos are supposed to only cater to foreign customers ages 21 and above situated outside the philippines in jurisdictions where online gaming is allowed hidden payments managing the cross border flow of money is a challenge china limits the amount of money any individual can move out of the country to $50000 per year and since it doesnt allow its citizens to gamble online they are also not allowed to send money abroad for this purpose it is usually wired electronically using services like alipay or wechat pay and disguised as a simple retail purchase said consultant ben lee chinese gamblers are also increasingly using crypto currencies like bitcoin to avoid detection chinese conglomerate tencent which owns messaging service wechat has set up a risk management team to combat abusive behavior such as illegal gambling by monitoring payments made via the app a spokeswoman told cnn cnn also reached out to tech company alibaba founder of alipay for comment but did not receive a reply to recruit new customers in china pogos rely on a large contingent of chinese workers they employ at least 138000 foreigners in the philippines most of them from china according to the philippine government there might be as many as 250000 if employees lacking the required work visas are included said george siy of the integrated development studies institute idsi a think tank in the philippines quoting estimates provided to him by industry insiders most of them come into the philippines on tourist visas and overstay them said lucio blanco pitlo iii  a fellow at the asia pacific pathways to progress foundation who has researched the topic extensively the chinese embassy in the philippines said in a statement in august 2019 that some of its nationals are cheated to work illegally with only tourist visas last november manila expelled hundreds of chinese nationals who had been arrested in a series of raids against online gaming operations and other cyber crimes in palawan province for allegedly working illegally in the country according to cnn philippines many chinese nationals working in the philippine casino industry are attracted by the promise of jobs not available at home experts say these are mostly young people in their 20s with little job prospects in china said ben lee some are lured to the philippines with the promise of high paying jobs in prestigious tech companies but upon arrival they discover they will be working for an online gambling platform and paid a fraction of what they were promised he added the workers frequently have their passports confiscated are crammed 10 to a room meant for three to four people and have to work 12 hour shifts with only one day off per month said pitlo on the job they are expected to approach prospective players in social media chat groups and convince them to give online gaming a try according to lee once players are hooked they are encouraged to wager increasing amounts of money he added pogos cater to foreign customers and thus employ foreign nationals as customer service representatives to effectively invite players and attend to their needs and concerns the pagcor spokeswoman said most of these foreigners are chinese nationals she said but we cant categorically say they are based in china or are targeting players in china she added they might be catering to mandarin speaking people in other countries jobs and high rents pogos have been a boon to the philippine economy they have created thousands of jobs and driven up wages said siy from the integrated development studies institute even if most online casino employees are chinese locals are finding employment with them as maintenance workers cleaners or security guards he added he says industry insiders believe up to 150000 filipinos could be working for pogos government coffers have also benefited in 2018 online casinos paid 74 billion pesos $145 million in licensing and other regulatory fees pagcor told cnn the department of finance said it expects to collect 24 billion pesos $471 million per year in taxes from pogo workers but many employers are not paying up pogo operators and service providers only paid 579 million pesos $11 million in withholding taxes in 2018    a mere 24% of what they owe according to the bureau of internal revenue in late 2019 the philippines finance secretary started following through on threats to shut down non payers in early 2020 the bureau of internal revenue bir said the industry still owes the government around 50 billion pesos $1 billion in unpaid taxes for 2019 the real estate market has also been transformed by online casinos said pitlo from the asia pacific pathways to progress foundation they took up more than 1 million square meters 108 million square feet in office space last year making them the largest tenant in the country even outstripping the call center industry he said rents have spiraled out of control in certain parts of manila as pogo operators rent out residential compounds to house their workers said pitlo middle class families are being priced out he said prices of one bedroom apartments have surged by 120% since 2015 along manila bay where many of the pogos are located according to a  july 2019 report by leechiu property consultants kidnappings on the rise the  increase in pogos has also led to a rise in criminality according to philippine officials in their free time their chinese employees often gamble at the casinos and end up in debt explained elmer cereno a spokesman  for the philippine national police anti kidnapping group they are then approached by loan sharks who offer to lend them money when they fail to pay it back the loan sharks kidnap them and try to get ransom from their relatives back home he said on october 2019 police rescued two chinese pogo workers whose families had been asked to pay ransoms ranging between 68000 yuan and 80000 yuan about $9800 to $11500 for their release according to a summary of the case seen by cnn  they had been abducted from a hotel six days earlier and held by five chinese nationals in an office building in taguig a suburb south of manila between january 2017 and october 2019 philippine police dealt with 65 cases of kidnap for ransom involving pogo workers or casino customers leading to the arrests of 132 people according to an official tally provided to cnn by the philippines police almost all the victims and perpetrators were chinese nationals said cereno that is where we stand china has been stepping up pressure on the philippines to ban pogos in its august 2019 statement the chinese embassy in manila said online gambling in the philippines had led to increased crimes and social problems in china because some gambling crimes and telecom frauds are closely connected it also said hundreds of millions of chinese yuan of gambling related funds were flowing illegally from china to the philippines  days later foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said he hoped that manila would ban all online gambling the philippines answered some of chinas concerns by imposing a moratorium on new licenses but stopped short of announcing a ban manila has its own concerns about the industry with top officials suggesting that the influx of chinese workers could turn to spying posing a risk to national security you would also start getting worried when a whole building a condominium tower is occupied by only one nationality where you might not be able to guard their activities philippine national security adviser hermogenes esperon jr said in july 2019 in may dozens of legislators introduced a new bill to ban pogos on the grounds they represent a social menace and a source of corruption manila earlier responded by announcing plans to build two self contained hubs for online casinos and their workers located in cavite city and clark two cities near the capital they both became operational late last year these hubs will allow pogo workers to carry out their work live and spend their leisure time under a single roof according to the pagcor spokeswoman it will also increase their safety as law enforcement agencies will have a presence there several government agencies such as the bureau of internal revenue will also set up antennae in the hubs she said this will allow them to keep a close eye on the pogos making sure they pay their taxes and obey the law china is not happy in the august 2019 statement it expressed grave concern about the centers saying they risked infringing the basic legal rights of chinese citizens philippine officials seem unperturbed they china cant dictate on us said philippine ambassador to china jose santiago sta romana in a media briefing those are sovereign decisions that is where we stand "

of people around the world who are saying loud and clear that black lives matter he said adding that the majority of protesters are peaceful however im extremely concerned that further protests in central london could not only risk spreading covid 19 but also lead to disorder vandalism and violence we know that extreme far right groups who openly advocate hatred and division are planning counter protests this means that the risk of disorder is high khan said the counter protests were clearly designed to provoke violence and the best way to respond was to stay home and ignore them he

state    president jair bolsonaro has pledged to crush criminals like cockroaches    the gangs have stepped up where before they peddled narcotics with the rule of the gun now they also push curfews social distancing and food handouts for the neediest we fear the virus not bolsonaro said ronaldo a gang member who like most people interviewed either requested anonymity or gave a false name we cant count exactly how many have already died the hospitals kill more than if you stay home and take care of yourself a drug gang granted cnn access one of rios poorest and most socially isolated communities to illustrate how it has dealt with covid 19 its an area inaccessible to state healthcare alcohol gel medication and cash handouts are all part of a system that gang members were eager to display with brazil now the country with the second highest number of coronavirus infections behind the united states and where cases are still doubling every two weeks four young men climb off their motorbikes and begin to lift large plastic bags from the back of a pickup truck the first package of groceries goes to a manicurist who has been out of work for four months the second goes to a street vendor things are getting very difficult said the street vendor who requested anonymity she says she is trying to set up a stall in the community but there is nobody to buy her products im trying at least she said kids and lots of people are getting sick the food theyre giving us helps a lot she says her father in law died in april from covid 19 he seemed stable she adds until he was transferred to hospital where he died within the day until now we didnt get a full report on what happened except that it was covid 19 she said it took two weeks for him to be buried she says that her uncle is now sick and hospitalized having caught the virus while at his supermarket job medical help is available in the community and hospitalizations are rare doctors from the community are helping the sick people voluntarily ronaldo said the people who have money can get assistance the ones who havent just cant the local community sometimes chips in to pay for burials says ronaldo the isolation was going well here but now even the president himself    in his own words    is disregarding it ronaldo said but we cant ease it weve seen a lot of death we know its not a small thing as he spoke two teenagers played pool nearby many here violate the social distancing rules like they do on the wealthier coast below its complicated to enforce quarantine on people ronaldo said these drug dealers    young and armed with old semi automatic rifles short barreled m4s and in ronaldos case a glock pistol adapted into a rifle    have become as knowledgeable about covid 19 as they are about narcotics when asked if they would accept any of the two million doses of hydroxychloroquine that the united states has agreed to send brazil    despite the drug being ruled ineffective against covid 19 and perhaps dangerous by the world health organization    ronaldo replies i dont think hydroxychloroquine helps its bs everything that comes to brazil from abroad has already been contaminated the streets seem busy for curfew bars are closed however and business has adapted to the pandemic neia a hairdresser before the pandemic has turned to making masks she sells them through her front window which allows her to stay inside theyre free for children and three face masks cost 10 reals about us$175 for adults but neia says that drug dealers give her 15 reals i am more afraid of the virus than anything else here she said an elderly man who lives there next to her home died people in general are respecting isolation crime has often cut this community off from the rest of rio police regularly raid the area as part of bolsonaros crackdown on favelas he has said that a policeman who does not kill is not a real policeman and the resulting uptick in deadly operations has led to outcry from human rights advocates the most recent raid near this favela occurred ten days ago and left at least seven dead the signs another raid may be on its way are everywhere a big rock blocks a road the sound of firecrackers from a rooftop    a warning that a lookout has seen something strange and the police may be coming again nearly everyone we spoke to had a story of death or infection from coronavirus daniel who runs a street food stall told stories of deaths he had heard of as he prepared pastels today there was a girl who lives nearby who died he said adding a friend of his with diabetes and a heart condition also died suddenly at home the street he lives on has seen two deaths he says theres less movement in the streets daniel said i wash my hands here all the time i use hand gel masks and clean the stall a lot the dealers have barred restaurants from putting tables out he says the virus is in control here daniel said even the dealers are afraid its not possible to control everybody the motorcycles whizz back and forth some carrying gunmen others ferrying  teenage girls out for the night the streets buzz with activity at times it feels like a world before lockdowns but locals say its fairly empty bars they say would normally hum with music and drug dealing would be more prevalent areas like these will be an enduring concern to healthcare workers as the pandemic grows the state will know little about how the virus has spread in these communities residents here may live apart from wealthier rio neighborhoods but many work there nonetheless and may spread the virus firecrackers suddenly crackle again and a lookout fears the police are on their way "

        "text": "sometimes books come at exactly the right time and that is certainly the case with the city we became the first book in nk jemisins great cities trilogy the fantasy novel is based on the idea that the essence of new york city is transferred to six humans    each an avatar for the five boroughs and one for the city as a whole    who must protect the city and its people from an intergalactic multi dimensional threat that manifests as a gentrifying woman in white no one knows how the pandemic battered new york will fare in the coming months or years but jemisin points to the solidarity and resiliency of the city new york has found ways to come together to make it a safer healthier half happier place people are looking out for each other she said from her apartment in brooklyn and the people who remain will still do what they can to be good new yorkers i suspect because theres something about being in the city that pulls that out of a lot of folks jemisin who was raised by her mother in alabama but spent summers and holidays in new york with her father became a full time resident of the city more than a decade ago and since then she has become the first author to ever win the hugo award for best novel awarded to a science fiction or fantasy book three years in a row for her bestselling broken earth trilogy she is a frequent contributor to the new york times and the foremost voice for diversity and inclusion in the world of fantasy writing below jemisin discusses her latest release and how she turned new york city into a setting for magic and allegory cnn how did you come up with the concept for the city we became and specifically the idea that cities are birthed in your opinion is new york alive nkj i travel a lot and ive lived in lots of different places whenever you go to a new place you get a feeling fairly quickly of whether you can be comfortable there and if the place is welcoming to you and yours new york has always felt like that to me and i just thought well there must be something to that if lots of people feel that personality or temperament then there must be something were all picking up on and if there is a personality there may be life cnn in the book five of the main characters each represent a borough of the city brooklyn queens manhattan the bronx and staten island what was your process for distilling the essence of each borough into a character nkj i started with whatever the stereotype of the borough is and then i tried to understand something about the boroughs history finally i wove the characters with my own impressions of the borough theres a substantial amount of just subjective opinion in there im sure im going to hear it from staten islanders because my opinion of staten island is distinctly noticeable brooklyn is 99 percent of what i know of new york so i decided to make brooklyn take a back seat because i love it so much even as a child my father lived in chelsea for a little but then he moved to brooklyn heights and this is before it was  fancy expensive brooklyn heights he moved to williamsburg in the 1980s when it was still a dump and he still is there today so ive seen the gentrification wave and what it does i was literally at ground zero of the hipster movement but really i wanted to de center my brooklyn ness cnn you have become one of the most recognized contemporary black writers in the fantasy genre can you speak to the importance of including more voices in a genre that has long struggled with diversity nkj im not doing anything different than what those old white men with beards living in middle america are doing with their fantasy stories theyre interjecting their white dude ethics and aesthetics into what they write and im doing the same thing with my fiction the only difference is that our society is configured to see one of those things as perfectly normal and the other as pathology some of the early reviews of the city we became criticized the book because it only has one white character but im just doing the same thing that television shows like girls do    im just showing new york from my perspective ive never seen new york as a white place where everybody has really large apartments if im going to write new york im going to write the new york i know in which artists and queer people and black people and all kinds of people with different ethnic backgrounds are blending and talking to each other and eating each others food that is the new york ive always known science fiction is about where were going but fantasy is about where weve been if you look at these depictions of medieval europe in fantasy novels written by middle american white dudes its not what the real medieval europe was like    art from the same period shows people of color and women in prominent roles the fantasy weve been getting for the past few decades caters to a particular way of thinking about the world that needs to change    especially regarding women whiteness race in general and how cultures interact fantasy is enhanced by having different voices but ive always said that black and female and queer writers will know when we have arrived when our work doesnt have to be exceptional when our mediocre wish fulfillment fantasies get published as often as the white dudes fantasies get published cnn which authors have you been reading lately and what is it about their work that resonates with you nkj as part of my research for the city we became i read the life and death of great american cities by jane jacobs jacobs was a contemporary of the famous new york city planner robert moses and people just simply didnt listen to her partly because she was a woman but her perception of how to make safer and healthier cities was rooted in observations of how people actually interact if jane jacobs had had the power to impact the city the city would be a much healthier place read me an excerpt from the city we became mannys stomach has knotted with fear he can tell shes about to do something and he still has no idea how to fight her what do you want he asks to stall her to buy time to think she shakes her head and sighs it would probably be sporting to tell you but theres no sport in this for me i just have a job to do goodbye manhattan all at once shes gone the woman in white that is between one blink and another the white womans clothes and hair flicker back into their ordinary tints she slumps a little just an ordinary brown eyed woman again but after a moment of confusion the womans lips tighten and she raises her cell phone again the camera light goes back on but something worse is happening when the hairs on the back of mannys neck prickle he jumps and wheels around suddenly convinced that someone is coming at him from behind he sees the forgotten young couple on the lawn still picnicking but otherwise theres nothing there\u2014 wait no rising from cracks and spars in the asphalt of the path are ghostly little white nubs manny grabs bel and yanks him back just as white nubs rise through a crack hed been standing on more wriggle through even the unbroken portions of the asphalt when manny sees that no white nubs are rising from the narrow ring of bare soil that surrounds the tulip tree rock and perhaps another three or four inches beyond that manny pulls them both to stand within this apparently protected circle what are\u2014 bel begins bel can clearly perceive the white nubs manny is relieved to see at least he doesnt have to explain this too bel backs himself against the rock looking around in horror as the nubs become inchworms just disgusting says the woman she stands amid an ankle high lawn of the tendrils now\u2014and the one coming from the back of her neck has fissioned into two both of them uncannily oriented on manny incredibly through all this shes still recording them or\u2014not just recording an instant later a voice crackles from the phones speaker manny cant make it out but he hears the woman say i need the police there are these two guys in inwood hill park who are i dont know menacing people i think theyre drug dealers and they wont leave also theyre having sex listen woman i dont think you know what sex looks like\u2014 bel splutters in the distance the young couple giggles though manny doesnt think its because of what bel said theyre busy making out and havent noticed whats happening by the rock the woman ignores bel intent on her conversation yes i will im recording them right uh huh she hesitates then screws up her face and adds african american or maybe hispanic i cant tell im obviously british asian you stupid bint bel stares at her openmouthed meanwhile however the tendrils are still growing and getting long enough that theyre going to be able to touch bel and manny even if they climb on top of the rock which probably isnt going to help since the rock isnt big enough for two people to stand on which reminds manny that the rock is meaningful an object of power\u2014somehow shorakkopoch site of the first real estate swindle of the soon to be new york what can he do with that oh ohhhh he pushes at bel get up on the rock he says i need the room and give me whatever is in your wallet its a measure of how freaked out bel is that he complies scrabbling onto the rock and groping for his back pocket worst mugging ever mate he quips with a shaking voice manny has pulled his own wallet out of his pocket he finds himself remarkably calm as he opens it and rummages for something that will serve that tickle of an idea in his mind and a detached analytical part of him contemplates this lack of fear he should be terrified after seeing what these tendrils have done to another human being what will it be like to have his body invaded and his mind overtaken by whatever entity these things serve like dying he decides and since some part of him has faced death before\u2014hes aware of that suddenly its why hes so calm\u2014manny also decides that hes not going out like that theres not much in his wallet some receipts a five dollar bill an amex card a debit card an expired condom no photos of loved ones which will strike him as odd only later an id\u2014but immediately he tears his eyes away from this not wanting to see the name he had prior to this mornings train ride who he used to be is irrelevant right now he needs to be manhattan the instant his fingers touch one of the credit cards he feels a flicker of that strange energy and focus that he had on fdr yes land has value he murmurs to himself distracted from the rising whipping field of white all around him even public land like in a park its just a concept land ownership we dont have to live like this but this city in its current form is built on that concept please tell me you arent losing it bel says from where hes crouched on the rock i dont think both of us can afford a psychotic break at the same time we just signed a lease manny looks up at him\u2014and tosses the fiver to the ground just beyond the rocks ring he feels rather than hears a sudden hollow high pitched squealing from where the bill has landed and he knows without looking what has happened where the bill has touched the asphalt it has hurt the tendrils and caused the ones in that immediate area to withdraw bel stares at this frantically he pulls a handful of disordered bills out of his wallet some of them are euros some british pounds us bills and a few pesos clearly bel travels a lot he tosses one of the pound notes it lands not far from the bill manny threw but nothing happens i told you to give it to me manny says snatching the wad of bills from bels shaking fingers doing this strengthens the strange feeling manhattan was built not only on land valuation but stolen value just trying to help with this bollocks bel snaps god do whatever nonsense you have to do theyre getting closer manny starts casting the bills around the edge of the field of white make it rain style he quickly sees that the money is having an effect but not much of one a five pound note clears the space underneath it but no more and he loses sight of it after a moment amid the surrounding field of tendrils the euros and pounds work too but it seems to depend on their value a hundred dollar bill clears not only its own space but an inch or so around itself a hundred euro note clears slightly more\u2014but all of it together adds up to only enough space to keep the nearer tendrils from being able to reach manny and if the tendrils keep growing theyll eventually be able to reach manny no matter how many additional inches of land hes gained thats it suddenly manny understands he is effectively buying the land around the tulip tree rock but it costs a lot more than sixty guilders now bel do you know how much manhattan real estate runs per square foot are you actually insane one of the taller tendrils whips toward mannys thigh and he swats it with a twenty dollar bill it squeals and withdraws i really need to know please how the bloody fuck should i know im a flat renter not a buyer maybe a thousand dollars a foot two thousand thats the problem then manny realizes with a bitter groan manhattan real estate is horrifically expensive and they dont have enough cash to buy their own lives in desperation he tosses his amex and that has the biggest effect yet clearing a rectangular chunk of space the size of a sedan apparently hes got good credit bel doesnt have any cards however and there are tendrils beyond the space hes cleared\u2014and now mannys only got the debit card left how much money is in his bank account he cant remember okay says the woman with satisfaction manny is stunned to realize he forgot her for a moment she smiles at them from amid the thickest knot of gently waving tentacles her head and shoulders now festooned with at least a dozen the police say theyre on their way you people might have been able to get away with doing drugs or blowing each other in broad daylight before but i didnt move here to put up with stuff like that were gonna get you out one by one mannys consternation about manhattan real estate prices is eclipsed by sudden dry mouthed fear if the police do show up\u2014which isnt a guarantee even as a newcomer he can tell inwood is still too brown a neighborhood for a definitive or quick response especially during a citywide emergency\u2014they will walk right into the rapidly growing field of white tendrils that now surrounds manny and bel and if one tendril has turned a nosy racist white woman into a conduit for disembodied existential evil he doesnt want to see what infected nypd will become hes getting ready to throw the debit card and hoping desperately that that account just happens to contain a million dollars or so when they hear another cell phone new york new york big city of dreams its mostly a gabble of tinny sound from this distance probably an iphone but from the gabble manny can make out handclaps over a beat electronic drums and a record scratch like in old school rap too much too many people too much manny whips around to see a middle toned black woman coming toward them along a path that converges with the shorakkopoch clearing shes tall and strong with an upright carriage and thighs that are nothing but curve the latter accentuated further by the pencil skirt shes wearing the hell out of some of her bearing comes from all this style plus smart heels and an elegantly texturized honey blond dyed cap of curls\u2014but most of its just her shes a presence she looks like either a ceo on her way to an incredibly stylish meeting or a queen who just happens to be missing her court then manny sees that shes also holding up a cell phone instead of filming however shes using this one to blare music the song is a little before mannys time but hes heard it once or twice and\u2014ah with every tinny beat of the synthesized drums the field of tendrils that has filled the tulip tree rock clearing begins to twitch en masse as manny inhales in relief the woman steps onto the cobbles and the tendrils flinch away from the brisk click of her heels the ones she steps on actually scream in tiny hissing squeaks as they writhe\u2014and then vanish when she directs the phone downward the ones that havent already withdrawn shudder as if each beat is a painful blow then they crumble away leaving no residue or sign that they were ever there the tendrils are crumbling away everywhere too much too many people too much yes the city might welcome newcomers like manny but mind controlling parasitic otherworldly entities are the rudest of tourists five of us manny murmurs he knows who or at least what this woman is"

        "text": "off the coast of cullercoats in northeast england researchers max kelly and priscilla carrillo barragan send a long tubular net into the depths of the north sea known as a vertical tow the net is used to collect samples of microscopic zooplankton whose health can serve as a bellwether for an oceans overall wellbeing newcastle universitys dove marine laboratory has been collecting microorganisms from these waters for the last 50 years shedding light on the impact of changing nutrient levels and global warming but now experts are studying the samples to examine a growing but almost invisible threat to our seas plastic microfibers microplastics those measuring up to 5 millimeters in diameter make up almost a fifth of the 8 million tons of plastic that ends up in the oceans each year of these miniscule strands known as microfibers    which largely come from synthetic clothing    are the most common according to kelly who researches marine biotechnology at the university a lot of our work is focused on polyester and polyester is the most widely used synthetic fiber in the textile industry he says so were  looking at what happens when we wash clothes what polyester fibers come off and wash down the drain pipes into the ocean where they can be ingested by a wide range by animals every time we do our laundry our clothes shed millions of microfibers although wastewater treatment plants are able to catch as much as 99% of them the rest can eventually flow into rivers waterways and ultimately the ocean you go from washing machine into environment pretty easily kelly adds invisible threat with monday marking world oceans day much attention will be paid to the impact of plastic bags bottles and discarded fishing nets on marine life but while these pollutants pose serious threats to larger animals its microplastics that disrupt life at the very bottom of the food chain according to carrillo barragan a research associate at dove marine laboratory the fibers have an immediate impact on the microorganisms themselves on aspects such as feeding behavior reproduction and larval development this could in turn affect the health of the whole marine ecosystem its been reported that instead of eating what they need microorganisms are eating plastic so they dont get the nutrients they need she explains and then what the studies mention is they dont develop as they should if you think of these microorganisms being at the base of the food web then  they are food for other bigger species and then they are not getting the nutrients they need so it is overall a less nutritious cycle there are fears that these plastic particles may eventually end up on our dinner tables and while there are still many unanswered questions about bioaccumulation    a process whereby potentially toxic particles make their way up the food chain    carrillo barragan sees worrying signs in the nascent research its an early science she says we are just starting to do experiments on the possible effects that microplastics might have in all levels of life    including us we dont know exactly what is going to happen or what will be the consequences but we can tell that just by the abundance of microfibers in the ocean  that there might be something fast fashions impact at the root of the problem is a global textile industry that kelly says produces more than 40 million tons of synthetic fabrics a year the vast majority of this is polyester clothing he explains while acknowledging the materials many benefits its a great material to make clothing he concedes its very breathable it is used a lot for sports and outdoor activity they dry really well and its a cheap material as well it is very durable and lightweight so it is ideal in terms of clothing however  that durability makes it very difficult to degrade the british researcher has been working with multinational corporation proctor & gamble which makes detergents among much else to investigate how individuals laundry habits may impact the number of microfibers released per wash their studies have found that delicate wash cycles can produce 800000 more microfibers than regular ones neil lant a research fellow at the american firm says that cold quick wash cycles can help people reduce their plastic footprint he also recommends only running full loads and using a high efficiency washing machine the use of chemical detergents fabric softener and stain removers as well as the synthetic dyes released from clothes during washing can all have a negative impact on the environment but cutting down the amount of new clothing we buy may in addition reducing textile waste have the added benefit of lessening microfiber pollution we found new clothing was shedding much more fiber than older fabrics lance says and we did testing of 60 washes to confirm this thats really important because its telling consumers another way that they can slow down fiber loss and to significantly reduce the amount of fibers released is to buy less new clothing itll help people financially and itll also be great for the environment so we think everyones a winner but it does involve a culture change for sure kelly adds people should care because weve all got to play our part if we play our part its going to equate to a big overall positive impact on the ocean watch the video above to learn more about newcastle universitys research into the environmental impact of microfibers"
