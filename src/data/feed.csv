0,Coronavirus: NHS staff need tests 'twice a week',Two leading doctors said regular testing is needed to give patients confidence as the NHS reopens.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:26:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53066177,"A leading surgeon has said NHS staff must be routinely tested for coronavirus up to twice a week. Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said it was vital, to reassure patients staff were not unwittingly carrying the virus. But hospital trust bosses say they are still waiting for clarity on plans for regular testing. The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was focusing on routine testing in care homes. Prof Alderson was speaking at a Health Select Committee meeting about the necessary steps to get all NHS services back up and running. He said: ""It's absolutely essential to regain public confidence that we are able to test our staff regularly."" It would be ""pragmatic"" for testing to take place ""about twice weekly"", he added, because it was known that the available tests were not perfect. As many as 30% of infections could be missed by a single swab test, research from the University of Bristol suggests - giving an infected person a negative result. So a negative result should not be treated as a guarantee, scientists say. ""It will always be essential to have multiple tests,"" Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, told the BBC. ""In addition to the challenges of accurate sampling, you can be fine one day and infected the next."" Experts are concerned about the possibility of asymptomatic spread, where staff don't know they are infected, but may still be capable to passing the virus on to others. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it had capacity to carry out just over 200,000 diagnostic tests as of 15 June. But only 75,935 of these tests were actually carried out. ""There is adequate capacity, it just needs to be directed to those who need it most,"" Prof Alderson said. A staff testing pilot scheme was carried out across 11 hospital trusts more than a month ago, according to NHS Providers, which represents trust leaders. ""But we've had no results and no timeline,"" its deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery said. ""We have no idea when it will be rolled out."" As it stands, she said, there is no system in place to carry out weekly testing of health staff which she estimates will amount to more than 100,000 a day. ""It's a big issue if we want the NHS to get back on its feet,"" Ms Cordery said. The government said care home staff and residents could be tested even if they don't have symptoms at the end of April, but it has not committed to routinely testing NHS workers. A DHSC spokesperson said retesting would be ""guided by clinical advice on relative priority and available testing capacity"". Follow Rachel on Twitter"
1,Stars urge BBC to protect regional current affairs programmes,Broadcasters from Stephen Fry to Sir Lenny Henry sign a letter urging the BBC not to cut Inside Out.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:43:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53068900,"Dozens of broadcasters from Stephen Fry to Sir Lenny Henry have signed a letter asking the BBC not to cut its English regional current affairs programmes. The BBC has cancelled the autumn series of Inside Out and merged its weekly regional political programmes. The BBC is now ""seriously under-serving regional audiences"", the letter sent by the National Union of Journalists said. In response, the corporation said the coronavirus pandemic had ""forced us to prioritise our resources"". The letter is addressed to outgoing director general Lord Hall, who has said the BBC must find £125m savings this year, and his successor Tim Davie. The signatories also include presenter Fern Britton, actor Dominic West, naturalist Chris Packham, writer and actress Daisy May Cooper, poet Benjamin Zephaniah, director Ken Loach and broadcaster Gloria Hunniford. It says: ""Never has in-depth investigative journalism, holding people to account and reflecting the regional diversity of England been more important."" Inside Out is broadcast in 11 regions, covering a wide array of stories and issues affecting life in those areas. Meanwhile, the regional Sunday morning political programmes have been replaced during the pandemic by a single show. The letter continues: ""If these cuts were to become permanent they risk damaging English democracy by the failure to provide an important platform for those voices in our communities who need and want to be heard. ""Even when faced with financial pressures we urge the BBC to not reduce regional programming and to defend a vital element of public service broadcasting not available anywhere else."" A BBC spokesman said: ""Local and regional broadcasting is in the BBC's DNA and we're especially proud of how our services have performed during recent months. ""The pandemic has forced us to prioritise our resources so we've cancelled the autumn series of Inside Out and are continuing with the single political programme for England through to the summer. ""The BBC does face very real financial challenges so naturally we are looking at what savings might be possible across the BBC."" In January, Lord Hall unveiled a plan to have at least two thirds of the corporation's staff based outside London by 2027. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

2,'Invisible' unpaid carers going hungry in lockdown,"Unpaid carers looking after their parents and relatives are turning to food banks, say researchers.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:38:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-53070741,"Christie Michael is so worried about protecting her elderly mother that she has not gone outside her front door since the lockdown began in March. She says it is ""lonely and isolating"" - but the mother and daughter in Essex have also found themselves hungry. Research from Sheffield and Birmingham universities suggests more than 100,000 unpaid carers in the UK have had to rely on food banks during the pandemic. Helen Walker of Carers UK says unpaid carers are at ""breaking point"". The study looked at the experiences of people caring for parents and disabled relatives during the lockdown - and found 229,000 unpaid carers were in households where people had ""gone hungry"". Christie, now in her thirties, lives with her mother in Waltham Abbey and has been caring for her since childhood - watching over her mother as she suffered from seizures and other health problems. But during the lockdown they faced a different kind of problem: ""We were actually hungry."" Christie did not want to risk going to the shops while she was shielding her 76-year-old mother. And even if they could have got an online delivery, they didn't have enough money - so much so that they depended on deliveries brought by food banks. ""People don't understand the importance of food banks,"" she says, or how widely they are now being used. When they had emptied their cupboards, using up the baked beans and cereals, she said they were ""not eating"". ""I don't know what we would have done without the food bank."" When government food parcels did arrive, she didn't like to complain that much of it contained dairy products, when her mother was lactose intolerant. As a full-time carer she is entitled to a carer's allowance of about £67 per week - and the Carers UK charity is pushing for an increase. But even with other benefits on top, Christie says her current reality is ""spending every penny on food, rent and bills"". Every other cost that comes along, ""like something breaking down"", means borrowing and that creates another second wave of financial problems. What makes it tougher, says Christie, is the lack of recognition for such carers, protecting the people they love, but spending their waking hours looking after someone and being trapped without any money. During the lockdown, she says the sense of being invisible and forgotten has been even more intense. She has remained behind her door - and doesn't expect to be outside until the end of July, so as not to ""put mum in jeopardy"". In the past, she says there were some respite hours available to people caring for relatives - but that has gone. And she calls for a more consistent approach for support available for carers. The study from academics at Birmingham and Sheffield universities suggests that unpaid carers are twice as likely to have used food banks during the pandemic, compared to the general population. Professor Sue Yeandle of Sheffield University says this should ""shock the nation"". ""It cannot be right that carers are hidden from view, with declining mental wellbeing or face hunger or food poverty,"" she says. The chief executive of Carers UK, Helen Walker, says: ""Surely when the majority of carers are providing even more care for relatives during this pandemic, and spending more to do so, they deserve some help?"" A spokeswoman from the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The government is hugely grateful for the crucial role that carers play, especially during this unprecedented period and we recently announced an extra £63m to support people struggling to afford food and other essentials due to coronavirus. ""The rate of carer's allowance was recently increased and we are working closely with carers organisations to further support carers during this outbreak, including funding to extend Carers UK's helpline opening times so unpaid carers are able to access trusted information and advice."""
3,New trials planned for cash-stricken communities,Organisers hope the projects will inform debate over the future of cash at a time when card use in rising.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:01:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53068282,"Eight locations across the UK, including an army barracks, have been chosen for trials to help solve problems with access to cash. Organisers hope they will inform debate over the future of cash in the UK, particularly for those who rely on it. The Community Access to Cash Pilot will test new subsidised ATMs and local cash deposit centres for retailers. It comes as a new forecast suggests cash use will fall faster in the UK than in much of Europe. The plan for trials was drawn up in light of a major report warning that the country is ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society. It concluded that eight million people in the UK rely on notes and coins, ranging from those without a bank account to people who are not comfortable with digital payments. That work was led by Natalie Ceeney, who is also in charge of the pilot projects. ""Over the past decade we've seen a massive shift from cash to digital payments, and Covid-19 has accelerated that trend further. But we know that digital payments don't yet work for everyone, and for many individuals and communities, cash remains essential,"" she said. ""But the world is changing - we can't just magic back our old bank branch and ATM infrastructure. Instead, we need to use innovation to develop new solutions as well as harness tried and tested approaches to meet people's needs."" Some of the places selected are remote communities, such as the village of Botton, North Yorkshire, and Lulworth Camp, a military barracks in Dorset miles away from the nearest cash machine. Small towns with thousands of residents which have seen bank branches or cash dispensers disappear are also included such, as Ampthill in Bedfordshire, along with Rochford, in Essex, Denny near Falkirk, and Cambuslang, in Lanarkshire. Burslem, in Staffordshire, is also on the list, as is Hay-on-Wye, which has a large number of bookshops and other small businesses with no bank branch to deposit notes and coins. Banks have been persuaded to pay for the pilots, trying out ideas like shared branches, more cashback in shops, as well as better bus services to allow people to visit surviving branches. Stephen Jones, chief executive of UK Finance, which represents the banks, said the sector was ""committed to ensuring that access to cash remains free and widely accessible to those who need it"". The coronavirus outbreak has accelerated the decline of cash use for many people. A recent survey by Link, which oversees the UK's cash machine network, suggested that 75% of people had used less cash during lockdown. One new forecast by consultants Accenture claimed that cash usage in the UK would drop by 40% this year, compared with 2019 - a faster drop than a 30% predicted fall in the major economies of Europe. Sulabh Agarwal, from Accenture, said: ""One of the key issues facing [retailers] will be how to take payment. While the decline of cash in the UK isn't new, there's little doubt that lockdown and social distancing measures have pushed consumers who typically rely on cash into digital payments."" Gareth Shaw, from consumer organisation Which?, said: ""With the existing cash system being pushed closer to the edge of collapse by the coronavirus outbreak, it is clear that new solutions are desperately needed to secure people's access and ability to pay with cash, which millions of people still rely on as their main form of payment."" The results of the pilots will be published in early 2021."
4,Coronavirus: Dexamethasone proves first life-saving drug,"Patients should be given the cheap drug without delay, after ""fantastic"" trial results, experts say.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:44:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53061281,"A cheap and widely available drug can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with coronavirus. The low-dose steroid treatment dexamethasone is a major breakthrough in the fight against the deadly virus, UK experts say. The drug is part of the world's biggest trial testing existing treatments to see if they also work for coronavirus. It cut the risk of death by a third for patients on ventilators. For those on oxygen, it cut deaths by a fifth. Had the drug had been used to treat patients in the UK from the start of the pandemic, up to 5,000 lives could have been saved, researchers say. And it could be of huge benefit in poorer countries with high numbers of Covid-19 patients. The UK government has 200,000 courses of the drug in its stockpile and says the NHS will make dexamethasone available to patients. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate ""a remarkable British scientific achievement"", adding: ""We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak."" Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said it would save lives around the world. About 19 out of 20 patients with coronavirus recover without being admitted to hospital. Of those who are admitted, most also recover but some may need oxygen or mechanical ventilation. And these are the high-risk patients dexamethasone appears to help. The drug is already used to reduce inflammation in a range of other conditions, including arthritis, asthma and some skin conditions. And it appears to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body's immune system goes into overdrive as it tries to fight off coronavirus. This over-reaction, a cytokine storm, can be deadly. In the trial, led by a team from Oxford University, about 2,000 hospital patients were given dexamethasone and compared with more than 4,000 who were not. For patients on ventilators, it cut the risk of death from 40% to 28%. For patients needing oxygen, it cut the risk of death from 25% to 20%. Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This is the only drug so far that has been shown to reduce mortality - and it reduces it significantly. It's a major breakthrough."" Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray said the findings suggested one life could be saved for: ""There is a clear, clear benefit,"" he said. ""The treatment is up to 10 days of dexamethasone and it costs about £5 per patient. ""So essentially it costs £35 to save a life. ""This is a drug that is globally available."" When appropriate, hospital patients should now be given it without delay, Prof Landray said. But people should not go out and buy it to take at home. Dexamethasone does not appear to help people with milder symptoms of coronavirus who do not need help with their breathing. The Recovery Trial, running since March, also looked at the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which has subsequently been ditched amid concerns it increases fatalities and heart problems. The antiviral drug remdesivir, meanwhile, which appears to shorten recovery time for people with coronavirus, is already being made available on the NHS. The first drug proven to cut deaths from Covid-19 is not some new, expensive medicine but an old, cheap-as-chips steroid. That is something to celebrate because it means patients across the world could benefit immediately. And that is why the top-line results of this trial have been rushed out - because the implications are so huge globally. Dexamethasone has been used since the early 1960s to treat a wide range of conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and asthma. Half of all Covid patients who require a ventilator do not survive, so cutting that risk by a third would have a huge impact. The drug is given intravenously in intensive care and in tablet form for less seriously ill patients. So far, the only other drug proven to benefit Covid patients is remdesivir, which has been used for Ebola. That has been shown to reduce the duration of coronavirus symptoms from 15 days to 11. But the evidence was not strong enough to show whether it reduced mortality. Unlike dexamethasone, remdesivir is a new drug with limited supplies and a price has yet to be announced.

5,Coronavirus: The new rules for the 'day out',"Theme parks, museums and leisure attractions are working out how they can re-open safely.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:33:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53070380,"Theme parks, museums and leisure centres are working out how they could re-open safely, as lockdown restrictions ease in the UK. Even riding on a roller coaster is going to require a facemask and social distancing when attractions open up again. Blackpool's Pleasure Beach has decided that, on a ride on which people scream, visitors will be more comfortable if they are made to mask up. It is also going to be a less sociable experience - the seats on its Icon ride are only a metre apart so there will be empty rows to allow social distancing. After the opening of shops, Britain's leisure and cultural attractions are preparing for a government announcement that they too will be allowed to re-open. However, it will be months before many venues will be in a position to allow the public in again. A report from the Creative Industries Federation says 400,000 jobs are at risk and the cultural and creative economy is losing more than £1bn a week in revenue. It's this dire situation that is driving planning to ensure institutions will be able to re-open quickly once the government gives the green light. Museums will be some of the first spaces to re-open their doors but it will be a different experience. The Design Museum in London is removing its ticket desks and is moving to an online ticketing system to avoid the need for physical tickets and queues. There will also be a strict 90-minute time limit to reduce crowding and everyone will be directed along a one-way route. Toilets will be one in, one out. It will be a similar experience at hundreds of other venues. James Adebayo, a property consultant, has been advising on how to make socially distanced spaces. There are, he says, a series of measures that will become commonplace. Venues will increasingly have designated viewing points with limits on how long you can linger. And there will in many places be strict one-way systems to stop dawdling and bumping in to fellow visitors. Every one of them will do things slightly differently but here is a list of things you could well experience on a day out. Of course, this will only affect venues and attractions which can control the public.  Some, such as live music venues, which rely on crowds standing together face a much longer wait and a huge hole in their revenue. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

6,Coronavirus: Prince Charles's sense of smell and taste still not back,The prince discusses his experience with Covid-19 as the royals return to public engagements.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:22:29 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53026903,"Prince Charles has still not fully regained his sense of smell and taste after having coronavirus in March, he revealed on a visit to NHS staff. The prince discussed his personal experience with the virus as he met workers at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital - at a 2m distance. He was accompanied by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, who said the staff had showed ""Britain at its best"". It was the couple's first face-to-face public engagement since lockdown began. They met frontline staff and key workers from several NHS trusts, including consultants, nurses and cleaners, at the hospital near Prince Charles's Highgrove estate. Social distancing rules were observed, with those waiting to meet them standing on yellow dots to ensure they were 2m apart. Prince Charles greeted some of those he met with a ""namaste"" - clasping his hands together - instead of a handshake. Jeff Mills, 47, a healthcare assistant from Cheltenham General Hospital, said: ""He did speak of his personal experience, so first-hand experience for him. ""He also spoke about his loss of smell and taste and, sort of, still felt he's still got it now."" By Nicholas Witchell, royal correspondent They're never the most natural of meetings. Even at the best of times, royal visits can be a touch artificial. It's all that protocol: what do you call them; must one bow/curtsey; what does one talk about? And now it's become ever so slightly more complicated thanks to the requirements of social distancing. When Charles and Camilla turned up at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital they were greeted by staff who looked as though they were taking part in a military parade… they were formed up in impeccably well-presented ranks, each person 2m from each other. Everyone understood and the royal guests joked about taking a salute or telling everyone to ""fall out"". But the important thing was that it didn't interfere with the essential message of the occasion. Prince William too had resumed face to face royal visits, meeting first responders at an ambulance station in Norfolk. Conversations may not be at their most relaxed when the speakers are standing apart but no amount of protocol or ""distancing"" can dilute the underlying message of gratitude to all those who've been in the coronavirus front line. The 71-year-old prince was diagnosed with Covid-19 near the start of the outbreak, after suffering mild symptoms. A loss of smell is thought to be one of the key symptoms. He later said he had ""got away with it quite lightly"". Asked if the country's appreciation of the NHS had changed for good, the duchess said: ""I think it has, you can tell by all the people coming out every week to clap - they've done the most remarkable things. ""The way they've looked after people, the way they've sort of kept control of the whole thing... it's a question of not panicking and getting on with it and I think they are Britain at its best."" She also revealed the couple had their first socially-distanced reunion with their grandchildren last weekend, saying it had been a ""great treat"", even though they were not able to hug them. With lockdown restrictions being eased, the Royal Family have chosen to take a step towards a return to normality - with a series of face-to-face public engagements. The Duke of Cambridge visited Kings Lynn Ambulance Station in Norfolk - the first time he had met members of the public in person since coronavirus restrictions were imposed. Prince William joked about how he was looking forward to having a pint in the pub, as he praised staff for ""all your hard work"". He said: ""Everyone appreciates the NHS, we have an amazing system, it's a great health service and many countries around the world envy what we have. ""It's not until you have a big crisis, a pandemic, and everyone realises we have to really make sure we value and we show our appreciation."" He also joked: ""I'm worried about the waistline of the nation as well, with all the chocolate and cakes. I've done a lot of baking at home."" The prince recently revealed he had been volunteering for crisis helpline Shout 85258 during the lockdown."
7,India-China clash: 20 Indian troops killed in Ladakh fighting,It is the first deadly skirmish in decades between the two regional powers at their disputed border.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 20:20:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-53061476,"At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese forces in a disputed Himalayan border area, Indian officials say. The incident follows rising tensions, and is the first deadly clash in the border area in at least 45 years. The Indian army initially said three of its soldiers had been killed, adding that both sides suffered casualties. But later on Tuesday, officials said a number of critically injured soldiers had died of their wounds. India's external affairs ministry accused China of breaking an agreement struck the previous week to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins says violence between two armies high up in the Himalayas is very serious, and pressure will grow on the two nuclear powers not to allow a slide into full-scale conflict. Early on Tuesday the Indian army said three of its soldiers, including an officer, had died in a clash in Ladakh, in the disputed Kashmir region. Later in the day, it released a statement saying the two sides had disengaged. It added that ""17 Indian troops who were critically injured in the line of duty"" and died from their injuries, taking the ""total that were killed in action to 20"". China did not confirm any casualties, but accused India in turn of crossing the border onto the Chinese side. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said India had crossed the border twice on Monday, ""provoking and attacking Chinese personnel, resulting in serious physical confrontation between border forces on the two sides"", AFP news agency reported. Both sides insist no bullet has been fired in four decades, and the Indian army said on Tuesday that ""no shots were fired"" in this latest skirmish. How a clash that did not involve an exchange of fire could prove so lethal is unclear. There are reports that it was fought with rocks and clubs Local media outlets reported that the Indian soldiers had been ""beaten to death"". The LAC is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. The soldiers either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. But there have been tense confrontations along the border in recent weeks. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan valley and says China occupies 38,000sq km (14,700sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes. The two countries have fought only one war so far, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. In May, dozens of Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border in the north-eastern state of Sikkim. And in 2017, the two countries clashed in the region after China tried to extend a border road through a disputed plateau. There are several reasons why tensions are rising now - but competing strategic goals lie at the root, and both sides blame each other. India has built a new road in what experts say is the most remote and vulnerable area along the LAC in Ladakh. And India's decision to ramp up infrastructure seems to have infuriated Beijing. The road could boost Delhi's capability to move men and materiel rapidly in case of a conflict. India also disputes part of Kashmir - an ethnically diverse Himalayan region covering about 140,000sq km - with Pakistan. The two nuclear armed neighbours have a chequered history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn Line of Actual Control separating the two sides. Border patrols have often bumped into each other, resulting in occasional scuffles. But no bullets have been fired in four decades. That is why Sunday's night's clash following months of roiling tension has taken many by surprise. Whatever the result, the latest incident is likely to trigger a fresh wave of anti-China sentiments in India. It will also present daunting foreign policy and security challenges to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government, which is struggling to contain a surge of Covid-19 infections and revive an economy which looks headed for recession."
8,Flushing 'can propel viral infection 3ft into air',"Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that may spread infection, study finds.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:05:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53047819,"Flushing the toilet with the lid up creates a cloud of spray that can be breathed in and may spread infection, such as coronavirus, say researchers. Chinese scientists calculate that flushing can propel a plume of spray up and out of the toilet bowl, reaching head height and beyond. Droplets can travel up to 3ft - or 91cm - from ground level, according to the computer model used by the scientists from Yangzhou University. Shutting the lid would avoid this. The work is published in the journal Physics of Fluids. Coronavirus is spread through airborne droplets from coughs and sneezes, or objects that are contaminated with them. People who are infected can also have traces of the virus in their faeces, although it is not yet clear whether this might be another way to pass the disease on to others. Scientists around the world are testing sewage and wastewater to determine how some people might have become infected with coronavirus. Other viruses can be spread by poor toilet hygiene, known as faecal-oral transmission. As water pours into the toilet bowl during a flush, it strikes the side, creating turbulence and droplets. The droplets are so small they typically float in the air for more than a minute, according to study author Ji-Xiang Wang and colleagues from Yangzhou University, China. Dr Bryan Bzdek, from the Bristol Aerosol Research Centre at the University of Bristol, said although there was no clear evidence that coronavirus might spread in this way, it made sense to take precautions. ""The study authors suggest that, whenever possible, we should keep the toilet seat down when we flush, clean the toilet seat and any other contact areas frequently, and wash our hands after using the toilet. ""While this study is unable to demonstrate that these measures will reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, many other viruses are transmitted though the faecal-oral route, so these are good hygiene practices to have anyway."""

Eyewitnesses glimpsed the first just five miles north of Brecon in Powys on late Tuesday afternoon. Then 40 miles away at Bont Goch, east of Talybont in Ceredigion, another twister was caught on camera. Rebecca Charnock said she stopped her car to grab a quick shot, before the swirling clouds ""fizzled away"". ""I did start to wonder what it was - and then thought 'crikey - I need a picture',"" said Ms Charnock. ""It was coming towards me, and I thought 'I wonder where it is going to go? ""But then it just fizzled out and it was gone."" The Brecon sightings were captured by Della Morgan and her husband. ""I said quick, quick, come outside,"" said Mrs Morgan ""We watched it descend, it moved around and then dissipated."" The tornado can be clearly seen making its way across the ridge above farmland. The weather events were captured following a day of warnings for thunderstorms across much of Wales. Further alerts have also been issued for Wednesday between 12:00 and 21:00 BST for more storms. The yellow warning from the Met Office covers all but far western tips of Wales, with a small risk of flooding and lighting strikes."

Bowen eventually wrote a book about their relationship which became a smash hit and was made into a film, featuring Bob, in 2016. A Street Cat Named Bob: And How He Saved My Life was published in 2012, and there have since been five further books released in more than forty different languages. A second film, A Gift from Bob, which also features the eponymous feline, is due to be released later this year. Bowen credits his scarf-wearing companion with aiding his own recovery. In a statement on the official Facebook page for his books, the author said Bob had saved his life. ""It's as simple as that. He gave me so much more than companionship. With him at my side, I found a direction and purpose that I'd been missing."" ""He's met thousands of people, touched millions of lives. ""There's never been a cat like him. And never will again.

12,Marcus Rashford: Man Utd star a 'hero' in Wythenshawe,People in Wythenshawe praise Marcus Rashford for forcing a government U-turn on school meal vouchers.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:09:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-53065947,"Footballer Marcus Rashford has been hailed a ""real hero"" by people in the area of Manchester where he grew up. The Manchester United and England forward, 22, persuaded the government to extend the free school meal vouchers scheme in England throughout the summer after he penned an open letter to MPs. The government had previously insisted it would not award vouchers outside term time. In his #maketheUturn campaign, Rashford recalled relying on free school meals and food banks as a boy in Wythenshawe. So what do people there make of his success? Christian Latimer's six-year-old daughter Mia has benefited from free schools meals during the lockdown. The 27-year-old shop worker praised Rashford for his ""amazing"" campaign. He said: ""He showed great fight and he has achieved so much in helping families who struggle to feed their children. ""Mia had them [free meals] at school and it is a great support and boost for families. ""Marcus has stood up for those who need it,. ""As a United fan I thought he was great before but now he has shown the whole country what sort of a person he is off the pitch. ""I know he visits his old school and gives presents out to the kids. ""He is a great role model."" Rashford's former neighbours recall him playing football as a boy in front of his house in the Northern Moor area. ""He played out the front all the time with his brother,"" Anson James, 45, said. ""He always had a ball with him. ""People living round here don't have a lot of money so his family would have struggled. ""He is a great credit to the area with everything he has done."" Mike Graham, 51, said Rashford was also given free chicken patties from his favourite Caribbean takeaway J S Rhythm. ""He was so polite that the people who ran it would give him free food now and again as he did not have the money to buy it,"" Mr Graham said. ""He's a smashing lad."" HR worker Kate Jenner, 31, lives in Rashford's old house which she rents from his family. The footballer lived in the semi-detached home from 2006. She said: ""Marcus has been back to the area and the house a few times. What he has done is amazing to stand up for those in poverty and taking on the government. ""He is a credit to the country."" The Bideford Community Centre in Wythenshawe has turned into a food hub during lockdown and said volunteers ""leapt up and down"" when they heard the free meals scheme was being extended through the holidays. ""We're over the moon and so proud of Marcus,"" said Kirsty Taylor from the centre. ""This will make such a difference because we really are at crisis point. ""There is a lot of poverty in this area and we have been so worried - it is heartbreaking to see children hungry."" She added: ""We have been making 1,000-1,200 meals a week since the lockdown."" Kerry James, 31, who has used local foodbanks to help feed her two daughters, aged six and nine, said: ""It can be such a struggle to give them food and clothes. ""I've gone hungry so they can eat and it's heartbreaking sometimes when I can't get them all they need."" She added: ""Marcus is a hero that he is fighting for poor families and made the government change [its] mind."" Rashford's former head teacher Emma Roberts at Button Lane Primary School said the footballer was ""a real hero to our children"" and staff were ""really proud"". The school has twice the national average number of pupils eligible for the free school meals. She said some families faced further financial strains with unemployment or reduction in working hours as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rashford's old football club Fletcher Moss FC also praised their former player. It tweeted his actions show ""how footballers can help their own and other communities"" adding it was ""very proud of him"". Mike Kane, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale, tweeted the footballer had ""made a real difference to children's lives"". He said Wythenshawe was ""so very proud of you"", adding he was an ""outstanding role model"". Well done @MarcusRashford you have made a real difference to children’s lives. Wythenshawe is so very proud of you today, what an outstanding role model you are. Thank you for your amazing work. #HolidaysWithoutHunger https://t.co/u52iEtTknR End of Twitter post  by @MikeKaneMP"
13,Coronavirus lockdown: 'We all have to do our part in changing things',Coronavirus lockdown has given Miguel time to think about how he hopes to change the world.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 20:57:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52988163,"Coronavirus lockdown has given one young man plenty of time to think about how he wants to change the world. My name is Miguel Carrion, I am 21 years old, I am living with my parents in the San Francisco Bay area. 26 March: I haven't been getting much sleep lately, been sleeping really late. I've just been tired but I'm still grateful that I have my health and that you know I have a shelter, food and access to stuff that can distract me while everything is going on, and you know I have stuff I can do, and I'm grateful for that. 27 March: Before coronavirus, we would go to church once a week on Sundays and my mom would try to go every morning. But now with the coronavirus, we just stream church everyday. My parents woke me up to watch the Pope deliver his Urbi et Orbi message which is a plenary indulgence for the pandemic, those affected by Covid-19, and everyone else. An event that would normally draw hundreds of people to the Vatican was empty. We asked three young Americans to chronicle their very different experiences of the pandemic. Read about Maddie below, a 22-year-old student living in Ohio, and Ana who's just graduated high school in New York City. 30 March: Not even a 15 hour time difference, shelter-in-place order, and community lockdown can hold back a family function. My relatives in the Philippines usually have regular get-togethers just to update each other and talk about the latest chismis (gossip in Tagalog), but due to the Covid-19 outbreak, we have all resorted to using Zoom in order to communicate with each other. Though it was past midnight for my parents and I, the fun and laughter didn't stop for hours. 29 March: My family's lived in this apartment for almost 10 years. My mom came to America first from the Philippines in 2004, then my dad and I followed her in 2010. Ever since then I've been sleeping on the couch - it's a small, one-bedroom apartment but it's not too bad. 6 April: Here is my mom, retrieving last week's mail. What was once a daily occurrence has become something only to be done once a week. My parents decided that it was best to only grab the mail once a week to reduce having to touch something that other people may have come into contact with. 9 April: San Francisco in the time of Covid-19. What was once a bustling city full of tourists and locals is now close to empty. In Union Square, shops of all kinds are boarded up with sheets of plywood, the usual city traffic has halted, and sidewalks are no longer crowded. Though closed, most of these high-end designer stores will be able to financially recover. But I worry about the fate of hole-in-the wall and mom-and-pop shops. Driving through, I've seen a lot of tents lining the sidewalks. Despite the rich residents and lavish tech companies that inhabit the city, it seems that the most vulnerable citizens are left out by the local government. A lot of people were saying, instead of forcing the people experiencing homelessness to stay in the streets, why doesn't the city put them up in the hotel rooms since they're empty anyway? The suggestion went all the way to the mayor. I think it's a good idea. 15 April: Self portrait in a newly organised bathroom. Since the beginning of the shelter-in-place order, my mom had put up two signs ordering all of us to only use our own towels when drying our hands and took away the old communal hand towel. My mom also took the liberty of giving each of us our own tubes of toothpaste and bottles of mouthwash while labelling each item. 16 April: It's been more than a month since this project started, and I wish I could say that things are going back to normal, but obviously that's not what's happening. The only thing we can do is do our part and try to flatten the curve. It's frustrating that a lot of people don't feel the same way. And that they're going out there and protesting in huge groups of people in public and trying to end the quarantine when obviously that's not going to work. It's frustrating to see because it will probably just make everything last longer. It's also incredibly selfish. 10 May:  On Mother's Day, my parents and I dropped off trays of chicken adobo and rice in Daly City. The donation was for a free community feed hosted and organised by Pilipino Bayanihan Resource Center and the Filipino American Democratic Club of San Mateo County. Volunteers cooked and dropped off trays upon trays of the adobo and rice. Families and individuals were invited to drive up to the curb and receive pre-packaged plates of the classic Filipino dish to feed themselves and their families. 3 June: My family's been in quarantine for three months now. So I attended a protest in San Mateo county. It was a protest in solidarity with the other Black Lives Matter protests that are going on around the country and around the world. I've never been to a protest of that size, and it was just amazing to see all these people coming together for a common cause, fighting for what's right. Not everyone can go out all the time and always be out protesting, which is understandable because there's still coronavirus happening. And there are some people who are older, or some people who are probably immuno-compromised, or maybe it's just harder for them to self-isolate after going to a protest. But even now, a lot of people are still showing up and showing out, and it's incredibly important for us to all keep doing that."
14,Coronavirus: Greggs to reopen 800 shops for takeaway,Greggs edges towards full reopening while Cineworld cinemas plan to restart screenings in July.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:51:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53053685,"Greggs is to open about 800 shops for takeaways on Thursday after temporary closures during the coronavirus crisis. The bakery chain, which has more than 2,050 outlets, said it planned to reopen all its remaining shops from early July. Also on Tuesday, Cineworld said it would reopen UK cinemas with social distancing measures from 10 July. Shops and businesses are beginning to to restart as coronavirus restrictions ease. The UK government has been gradually easing lockdown measures, and Monday this week saw non-essential High Street shops reopening in England. Lockdown measures in England are due to be eased further from 4 July, when pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas could reopen. Fast food restaurants initially closed their doors during the coronavirus crisis, before some started to tentatively reopen. In May, McDonald's saw huge queues outside its restaurants as it started to reopen some of its UK drive-through outlets, while rival KFC had started to reopen restaurants for delivery in April. Greggs began to reopen shops during the coronavirus lockdown in May with a trial of 20 in the Newcastle area. After initially saying it would allow customers into the shops, it then backtracked and said the reopenings would be behind closed doors. In April, it said it hoped to reopen 700 stores from 8 June, including 150 franchise shops, and have all stores open again by 1 July, when the government's job retention scheme was due to end. That scheme was subsequently extended to the end of October. In its latest update, Greggs said it would now reopen 800 outlets on Thursday. The chain said there would be floor markings in the shops to help people maintain social distancing with protective screens at the counters, PPE equipment for staff, additional cleaning and more hand sanitiser. Customers would be encouraged to make contactless payments, it added. Greggs chief executive Roger Whiteside said: ""Looking forward, although great uncertainty remains, we are excited to be resuming our service for many customers this week."" Greggs has temporarily suspended its new shop opening programme except for shops where it is legally committed or expects strong customer traffic. It said it would open about 60 shops and close about 50 this year. It is approaching landlords to make rent reductions, and has speeded up plans for delivery and click and collect services. UK cinema group Cineworld said that with ""several blockbuster movies including Tenet and Mulan now confirmed for release in the coming weeks"" it planned to reopen in the UK and the US from 10 July. Although Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have different plans to England for easing lockdown restrictions, a Cineworld spokesman said the current plan was to reopen most cinemas across the UK, with delays in a few smaller outlets to make sure they can comply with social distancing expectations. Its chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""We are thrilled to be back and encouraged by recent surveys that show that many people have missed going to the movie theatre."" He added that a ""strong slate"" had been confirmed for the coming weeks, including ""A Quiet Place Part II, Wonder Women 1984, Black Widow, Bond, Soul, [and] Top Gun Maverick"". Among other measures, Cineworld said it had ""adapted our daily movie schedules to manage queues and avoid the build-up of crowds in our lobbies and enhanced our cleanliness and sanitation procedures across all of our sites"". Rivals Vue Cinemas said in May that it hoped to reopen in mid-July. Cineworld, which operates about 9,000 screens globally, abandoned a $1.65bn (£1.3bn) deal to buy Canada's Cineplex last week."
15,A Bee C: Scientists translate honeybee queen duets,"Queens ""quack"" when ready to hatch - but if two are free at the same time, they fight to the death.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 05:08:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53029218,"Scientists using highly sensitive vibration detectors have decoded honeybee queens' ""tooting and quacking"" duets in the hive. Worker bees make new queens by sealing eggs inside special cells with wax and feeding them royal jelly. The queens quack when ready to emerge - but if two are free at the same time, they will fight to the death. So when one hatches, its quacks turn to toots, telling the workers to keep the others - still quacking - captive. The findings are published in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr Martin Bencsik, from Nottingham Trent University, who led this study, described the tooting and quacking of these ""wonderful animals"" as ""extraordinary"". ""You can hear the queens responding to each other,"" he said. ""It has been assumed that the queens were talking to other queens - possibly sizing one another up vocally to see who is strongest. ""But we now have proof for the alternative explanation."" Tooting, the researchers found, is a queen moving around the colony - announcing her presence to the workers. The quacking is from queens that are ready to come out but are still captive inside their cells. The queens are not talking to each other, explained Dr Bencsik, ""it's communication between the queen and the worker bees - an entire society of tens of thousands of bees trying to release one queen at a time. ""Quacking queens are purposefully kept captive by the worker bees - they will not release the quacking queens because they can hear the tooting. ""When the tooting stops, that means the queen would have swarmed [split the colony and set out to find a new nest] and this triggers the colony to release a new queen."" Dr Bencsik said bee society was ""absolutely splendid"" to observe. ""All decisions are group decisions,"" he said. ""It's the worker bees that decide if they want a new queen or not."" Pollinating insects face numerous threats, including from pesticides, habitat loss and climate change. And Dr Bencsik pointed out that beekeepers - and the hives they provide - are crucial for honeybee survival in the UK. The researchers hope this eavesdropping exercise will help beekeepers avoid interfering with this delicate collective decision-making and to predict when their own colonies might be about to swarm.

16,"Diego, the Galápagos tortoise with a species-saving sex drive, retires","Diego, aged 100, returns to his native Galápagos island after decades of breeding in captivity.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 09:42:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-53062480,"A giant Galápagos tortoise whose legendary libido has been credited with saving his species from extinction has officially entered retirement. Diego and 14 other male tortoises have returned to their native Española, one of Ecuador's Galápagos islands. The tortoises were put out to pasture on Monday after decades of breeding in captivity on Santa Cruz Island. The breeding programme was a success, producing more than 2,000 giant tortoises since it began in the 1960s. Diego, aged 100, is thought to have fathered hundreds of progeny, around 40% of the 2,000 giant tortoises alive today by some estimates. Ecuador's environment minister, Paulo Proaño Andrade, said the breeding programme was ""closing an important chapter"" in its history. Diego and the other tortoises were returning home after ""saving their species from extinction"", the minister wrote on Twitter, adding Española welcomed them ""with open arms"". The tortoises had to be placed in quarantine before they could return to Española, an uninhabited island considered one of the oldest parts of the Galápagos. This was to prevent them from carrying seeds from plants that are not native to the island. Around 50 years ago, there were only two males and 12 females of Diego's species alive on Española. To save his species, Chelonoidis hoodensis, Diego was brought in from California's San Diego Zoo to take part in a breeding programme. The Galápagos National Parks service (PNG) believes Diego was taken from his native Española in the early 20th Century by a scientific expedition. The tortoise weighs about 80kg (175lb), is nearly 90cm (35in) long and 1.5m (5ft) tall at full stretch. The Galápagos Islands, 906km (563 miles) west of continental Ecuador, are a Unesco World Heritage site renowned worldwide for their unique array of plants and wildlife. The indigenous species found on the Galápagos, including iguanas and tortoises, played a key role in the development of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution. Tourists across the globe travel there to see its biodiversity."
17,Instagram 'will overtake Twitter as a news source',A report finds Instagram doubled its news audience last year - and could overtake Twitter by 2021.,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:02:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53050959,"Photo-sharing app Instagram is set to overtake Twitter as a news source, research suggests. The 2020 Reuters Institute Digital News report found the use of Instagram for news had doubled since 2018. The trend is strongest among young people. It said nearly a quarter of UK 18-24-year-olds used Instagram as a source of news about coronavirus. But social media platforms were also among the least-trusted sources. Just 26% of people said they trusted social media as a source of information about the virus. A similar percentage said they trusted news that had been shared via chat apps such as Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. National governments and news organisations, by contrast, were both trusted by about 59% of respondents. Instagram is now used by more than a third of all people who answered the survey, and two-thirds of under-25s. And 11% use it for news, putting it just one point behind Twitter. ""Instagram's become very popular with younger people"", said Nic Newman, lead author of the report. ""They really respond well to stories that are told simply and well with visual images"". Stand-out visual stories in recent months have helped - climate change, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the coronavirus have all seen massive engagement on the platform. Percentage of people who used the social network in the past week ""It's not that one necessarily replaces the other,"" Mr Newman said. ""They might use Facebook and Instagram, or might use Twitter and Instagram."" Instagram is owned by Facebook, which now reaches 85% of people each week. The company's dominance in how stories are being told ""remains incredibly important"", he added. The firm also owns WhatsApp. The coronavirus pandemic also seems to have offered a temporary reprieve to a downward trend in how much news organisations are trusted. Only 38% of people said they trusted the news most of the time. Less than half - 46% - said they trusted their favoured news source. In total, 40 countries were surveyed. Only in six of them did a majority say they could trust ""most of the news most of the time"". The case was particularly poor in the UK, where only 28% of respondents backed the statement. That figure was 12 percentage points lower than the nation's response in the 2019 report. That plummet in confidence was only matched by Chile and Hong Kong, which have both seen violent street protests - and still rank more highly than the UK, on 30% each. But things changed substantially once the coronavirus crisis hit. A slightly differently worded question in April - about the level of trust in information about the coronavirus - saw news organisations surge to a 59% trust rating, on a par with national governments. Average of six countries, April 2020 The report's authors speculate the identical levels of trust as a result of news organisations amplifying public health advice. But that sudden high has already started to fall. Trust is a precious commodity for journalists which, like all social goods, is easily destroyed, but not easily created. Maintaining trust in the era of social media gets harder every day, as conspiracy theories go viral, accuracy is too often sacrificed at the altar of virality, and the very idea of truth is so contested. This report shows a curious paradox in relation to trust. It is true that trust in what is sometimes disparagingly referred to as mainstream journalism is falling; yet the huge audiences for those outlets at the start of the pandemic are nothing if not a verdict on the public appetite for reliable, trustworthy news. In Britain, with its regulated broadcasting, there is still a lot of it about. The deeper question is whether a young audience will consume it. Reuters show the remarkable growth of Instagram as a news source, which makes Facebook's purchase of it look ever more like one of the greatest bargains in history. If, as the authors predict, Instagram overtakes Twitter next year, that might be the moment for journalists to finally realise that the latter, though their favoured platform, resembles public opinion less and less. ""What we're seeing is relatively high levels of trust - at the time of the lockdowns - in the media and national governments. But we have some polling since then, which shows that trust in the media fell 11 percentage points between April and May,"" Mr Newman said. While not officially part of the report, that recent polling suggests that the ""moment of national unity"" may have passed. Amid all this analysis of trust issues, most people - what the report calls the ""silent majority"" - prefer what they consider ""objective"" news. The authors of the report had not asked this question since 2013, since when the use of opinion and open stances on news reporting has grown. In nine countries where this was explored, all said they preferred news from sources with ""no point of view"". The strongest preference was in Germany, Japan, the UK and Denmark. These are ""all countries with strong and independent public broadcasters"", the report noted. In contrast, the US - ""where both politics and the media have become increasingly partisan over the years"" - many more people said they prefer news which shares their point of view. BBC News, which contributed data to the study, remained the most trusted news brand in the UK, with 64% trust. ""Despite the fact that the BBC has come under a lot of criticism, what we find consistently is the BBC remains, with most people, highly trusted,"" Mr Newman said. ""[It], along with broadcasters like ITV, tends to be the most trusted. ""But obviously, we have seen that eroding - particularly with a particularly vocal minority on both left and right, that in the last few years have trusted the BBC less."" The decline is particularly marked in those on the political left. Since the 2019 election, the left saw their confidence in the news dive to just 15%, the report found."
18,Coronavirus: ‘I’ve applied for more than 100 jobs’,Kayleigh Rennix is among thousands of people looking for work during the coronavirus crisis.,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:01:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53026175,"Kayleigh Rennix has never struggled to find work before. The HR manager from Essex was earning close to £40,000 working in the education sector before she resigned in March, fearing her role was at risk. Since then she's applied for dozens of jobs, but has had little interest from employers. ""As my leaving date approached, coronavirus reared its ugly head. I would say I've applied for more than 100 jobs and not had many call-backs,"" she says. Kayleigh had planned to find a new job quickly and restart work in May, after a holiday in Italy. But the coronavirus pandemic put paid to those plans. Now the 34-year-old has found herself relying on benefit payments for the first time in her life, and expects to move back in with her parents when her tenancy expires later in the summer. ""My rent is £900 a month and my universal credit is £740, so it's been quite stressful. I'm really grateful for relationships with my friends and family. My dad gave me some money for some food. It's been a rollercoaster really."" Kayleigh is among the millions of unemployed people who've found themselves looking for work during the UK's worst economic slump on record. Claims for universal credit, the benefit for working-age people, hit a record monthly level in the early weeks of lockdown. There are fears young people could be the worst hit. Twenty-one-year-old Kevon McPherson of Hitchin, Hertfordshire has been looking for work since he moved out of his foster home in December. ""I've been applying for absolutely everywhere, from dog-walking jobs to becoming a care support worker looking after the elderly,"" he says. Jobcentre staff directed Kevon to a course with youth charity the Prince's Trust, which placed him with his local fire station. With his mind made up that a career in firefighting was for him, Kevon was preparing to take the necessary entrance exams and begin applying for firefighting positions when the Covid-19 outbreak put everything on hold. ""The firefighters were really happy to have me. I beat the instructors at the bleep test [for fitness],"" he says. ""They said, 'Once you've done your firefighting test, come back to us.' But once the coronavirus hit, I was told we'll pick it up later. I'm a bit worried."" Marcin Mazurkiewicz, 32, had just started a new job as a groundskeeper at a holiday park in Argyll in western Scotland when the UK went into lockdown in March. Because he'd only been in the role for one and a half weeks, Marcin's employer wasn't able to put him on furlough, so he went back to stay with family in Poland. He's spent the last month looking for work on UK farms - but found very few jobs. ""In the media, they said there is a massive demand for workers like this, but that doesn't seem to be true anymore,"" he says. ""I found one job for fruit picking one day after it was posted online, and there was information saying they were not taking any more applications because it was filled immediately. Marcin was finally offered a one-month contract tree pruning in Campbeltown, which he plans to accept if he can find suitable accommodation. But he's doubtful about finding long-term work in the UK. ""I'm very worried because my life is more in the UK than Poland. I want to return to education and stay there for good."" Marcin's difficulties finding farm work come as no surprise to Russ Rogers. He started a Facebook group hoping to connect people looking for work with jobs on British farms. He contacted more than 100 farms, but has only managed to provide positions for two of the 1,000 people who have joined his group, called UK Farm Pickers Needed. ""On a daily basis I get 10-15 messages through the group from people asking for work. I have a telephone number on the page so I have text messages day after day from people, and emails, people send me their CVs. ""I've basically had to say many times there just isn't anything at the moment, and that next season starts in July and they need to try then."" While demand for farm workers has slowed, there are some industries that have rapidly ramped up recruitment during the pandemic. Supermarkets have been on a hiring spree, as demand for groceries surged. It's something Claire Leaman, 43, has taken advantage of. Before the coronavirus crisis, Claire ran her own business, offering business development services to property and construction firms. As the UK went into lockdown, her business lost two major clients and Claire panicked. She took a job at Tesco in south Manchester, ensuring there was a safe distance between customers in the aisles. Then the supermarket offered her a job as a picker filling online orders, which have doubled during the pandemic. Claire says the job has paid the bills, but she plans to leave as soon as she can get her business up and running again. ""In this job you're part of everything that's happening with the pandemic. You're a key worker and I suppose that's satisfying,"" she says. ""But it has been a little bit of a worry because you're around a vast amount of people and not everybody understands social distancing, so if I'm going to get the virus, I'm going to get it here, working at Tesco."" Source: The Prince's Trust Currently, the industry with the most jobs being advertised is IT, according to the recruitment firm Totaljobs. That's good news for 24-year-old Londoner, Megan Schiviano. At the beginning of June, she was made redundant from her job recruiting sales staff for software firms. But her experience in the tech sector, combined with the recent boom in e-commerce, has put her in a strong position, she says. In just one week she's already had interviews with five different firms. ""There's naturally going to be a lot more candidates than there are jobs, but I know what's asked and how to interview as I've been doing it for the last three years,"" she says. ""I'm quite a positive person. I wouldn't say I'm in a bad situation."""
19,India-China dispute: The border row explained in 400 words,Here's what you need to know about a border dispute that has turned deadly high in the Himalayas.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:29:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-53062484,"A military stand-off between India and China on their disputed border in the Himalayas has escalated into deadly clashes. In 400 words, here is all the important background to help you understand what is going on. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Monday night's incident. It happened in Galwan Valley in the disputed Ladakh region. China accused Indian troops of crossing the border twice, ""provoking and attacking Chinese personnel"". Both sides insisted that no shots were fired.  Indian officials gave accounts of fighting with bare hands, iron rods and stones. There were reports of Chinese casualties, but no official confirmation. Military officials from both countries later met to ""defuse the situation"", the Indian army said. The military superpowers have been arguing for decades over territory in the high-altitude, largely uninhabited region. Their armies come face to face at many points along the 3,440km (2,100-mile) shared border. The confrontation came after tensions bubbled up in recent months over a new road India built in Ladakh, along the Line of Actual Control which divides the sides. That angered China, which deployed troops and built infrastructure of its own in disputed territory, bringing the two sides' forces in closer proximity and heightening the risk of clashes. Both sides see the area as strategically important, economically and militarily. If neither gives way, the stand-off could have destabilising consequences for the region. The loss of life raises the stakes. Those deaths are believed to be the first in 45 years in a border confrontation between India and China. They have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. Potentially very, if efforts to reduce tensions fail. In recent days, army generals from India and China have been involved in talks aimed at resolving the border row. However, similar reconciliation attempts have stalled in the past. If they are not successful, there is a risk of escalation between two rivals who happen to be the world's most populous countries - and have nuclear weapons. ""This is extremely, extremely serious, this is going to vitiate whatever dialogue was going on,"" former Indian army commander DS Hooda said, commenting on Monday's clash."
20,What's behind the PM's aid department decision?,There is a tension at the heart of the plan to merge the Foreign Office and the department handling overseas aid.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:57:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-53072856,"The prime minister's announcement about the merger between the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development came in two parts. The opening statement to MPs, the bit that had been written and overseen by officials, had a clear argument. It was all about joining up policy, ending false distinctions between diplomacy and development, creating one department that can mobilise all Britain's assets overseas. But once Boris Johnson was facing hostile questions from sceptical MPs, his tone changed and his more instinctive arguments came to the fore. For too long, he said, Britain's aid budget had been seen as a cashpoint in the sky, detached from British diplomatic and commercial priorities. Voters will want to see that the government is spending aid efficiently. This is an opportunity, he said, for the UK to get more value from the huge investments that it makes in overseas spending. This is the tension that lies at the heart of this policy change. How much is it about making British foreign policy more effective and more coherent? And how much is it about satisfying those Tories who believe much foreign aid is wasteful and should be bent more to the will of British interests? For Mr Johnson, this is business that is long overdue. As foreign secretary, he looked avariciously at DFID's £15bn aid budget. He saw how it was DFID officials who had the power in many embassies around the world. And he learned of the tensions between two departments that at times had different priorities. As prime minister, he came to see the diffuse nature of UK foreign policy, dispersed between the FCO, DFID, the National Security Council and Downing Street, not to mention the departments for trade and business. So bringing this all together made sense to him. And he knew it would be controversial, although he might not have imagined that no fewer than three former prime ministers would weigh in against him, including one from his own party. International charities have long feared this merger might happen. They believe it may mean the UK's commitment to using its powerful aid budget to reduce poverty will be watered down. And the prime minister made this clear in the Commons. Yes, reducing poverty will, he said, remain central to the mission of this new Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. But he also suggested less money would go to Zambia or Tanzania, and more would go to Ukraine and the Western Balkans where there are vital European security interests. Yes, he said, the UK will remain committed to the target of spending 0.7% of its income on overseas development assistance. But his officials also made clear that the current integrated review of UK foreign policy will look again at redefining what actually counts as aid. To some Conservatives, the aid sector is too protective of its sacred cows, too unwilling to think differently about aid, even to accept that sometimes the UK national interest and reducing poverty can be the same thing. But to the pessimists, they fear the UK will now start spending more aid on curbing immigration, improving security and boosting British trade interests. The tricky question is the timing. Labour accused Mr Johnson of playing politics, of making the announcement today to distract from his health and economic crises. Government officials insist the PM just wanted to get the new department up and running this autumn so that it is well placed to handle the UK's presidency of the G7 and COP26 summit on climate change next year. But in the midst of a global pandemic, which Mr Johnson admits is forcing change in the way the UK does its foreign policy, some will wonder if this is the right time for Whitehall officials to start moving the chairs and changing the nameplates. The former British ambassador to Cairo and one time foreign policy adviser to David Cameron, John Casson, said the hope is that the merger will blend the best of the FCO's political agility with the best of DFID's delivery skills. His fear is that the new department may comprise the worst FCO short termism with DFID's bureaucratic caution. Nonetheless, Boris Johnson has made his choice. He has decided how he wants to retool his government to deliver its global Britain foreign policy. The only problem is he is still working out what that policy should be. That 'integrated review' of the UK's entire overseas strategy is not due to report until the autumn. It will not be the first time that a cart has been driven before a horse along the streets of Whitehall."
21,'I'm sorry for being racist when I was younger',Two young people who were racist when they were younger explain why they have changed.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 01:26:10 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52992534,"In primary and secondary school, Holly (not her real name) made racist comments towards the black students she was in class with. ""I remember thinking it was funny and I was being cool,"" the 22-year-old tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Even after being told by the people she was racially abusing that it was wrong, Holly continued to do so. The death of George Floyd in America and Black Lives Matter protests across the world have forced some people, like Holly, to confront their past racism and try to make amends. ""It's made me apologise for my racist behaviour when I was younger,"" she adds. Holly thinks one of the reasons for her behaviour was the influence of her family and friends growing up. ""I went to schools which were majority white, and I wasn't really exposed much to people from other backgrounds."" Groups Holly was part of would be racist towards classmates, and she would ""try to fit in"". She adds that her family's racist beliefs affected her thinking. ""They have very white-centric views. I think they believe black people are trying to be more superior, rather than be equal to white people."" But Holly accepts that ultimately, she is responsible for her own actions. ""Regardless, I know what I did was so wrong."" Joe (not his real name) also believes the influences around him affected his behaviour in school. ""I don't feel like my home was a hateful place. But I'd definitely hear the N-word every now and then,"" he tells Newsbeat. As he grew older, Joe copied his brothers when they would say racist things. ""Looking back, it was definitely not OK for me to say the things I did."" Joe had ""friends who were brown skinned"" - he thought it was ""his right"" to use racial slurs such as the N-word. He listened to songs which used the word and he ""couldn't see what was wrong"". ""I used phrases like the N-word indiscriminately and I didn't worry what those around me would think. ""I even lost a friend after making a racist comment, and I still couldn't see it back then."" Owen Jones is the director of education for campaign group Hope Not Hate, and he says there's a lack of knowledge around the origins of the word. ""If everyone was given a proper understanding of its context, the links with the slave trade, they would understand the difference between listening to the music and repeating the word."" ""It's having that cultural understanding which is lacking."" Holly's change in attitude came when she changed her social circles and joined a church, where she spent more time with black people. For Joe, it's slightly different. His ""turning point"" came five years ago when somebody taught him about microaggressions - subtle but offensive actions directed towards minorities which can reinforce stereotypes. Both Holly and Joe credit the Black Lives Matter movement for deeper self-reflection now. Holly's apologised for her past behaviour and says she is working to educate herself more about black history. ""Everyone has been glad that I've apologised and admitted what I did was wrong,"" she says. Joe acknowledges the protests have made him want to ""rectify the pain he caused"". ""I admit I messed up, so I know it's right to have said sorry to the people I hurt when I was younger,"" he adds. Holly and Joe say they are supporting the fight against racism. Joe's attended Black Lives Matter protests in the UK recently, and plans to go to more. He now works for a group which promotes educational equality. He says it's important to tell children when they slip up. ""If they say something they shouldn't - like the N-word in a song - it's down to us to explain why that's not OK."" ""I've been sharing links, signing petitions and trying to help people educate themselves,"" Holly says. That includes her family, which has been hard ""because they only see what's portrayed in the media they watch"". Owen agrees and says to prevent racism at an early age, it's important to get ""kids out of their cultural bubble"" - which is what changed Holly. And in regions where there's not much diversity, he suggests taking children to places where there are mixed backgrounds to ""show them people get along and the scare-mongering they might have heard is untrue"". ""These things have been passed down for hundreds of years. We're not born with racism, but we do have the capacity to be racist,"" he adds. ""And it's easy to slip into unless you have those conversations at a young age. It's not enough to just hope and say no to racism."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

22,'People queued for an hour to enter' the shop,"As the High Street opens for business, workers tell the BBC what it was like after weeks of lockdown.","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:01:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53056414,"The dust has settled after the first day of trading for non-essential shops in England since the coronavirus lockdown almost three months ago. Bargain hunters and spendthrifts alike descended on the High Streets, with some retailers seeing long queues and others reporting a quiet start to trading. So what was it like for the people staffing and running those shops? Neeraj Chadda, who manages a Currys PC World megastore in London, says he loved being back. He hadn't put a suit on to turn up to work in weeks. ""I was just happy doing that today,"" he said. And he wasn't the only one who was pleased that the shop at Staples Corner was able to open its doors again. Mr Chadda said people were queuing for about an hour to enter the store, which could only allow a maximum of 67 customers in at a time to facilitate social distancing rules. Things have changed behind the scenes as well. He has had to implement a one-way system in the store's warehouse and make sure there is enough protective gear for his 130 employees. Compared with a typical Monday in June, Mr Chadda says the store saw at least four times the number of people walk through its doors when they reopened after almost three months in lockdown. Some retail experts have predicted an initial sales surge from pent up demand, followed by a slump. But Mr Chadda, who has worked in the sector for a quarter of a century, is more optimistic. ""I think this week will be a good guide to what happens ahead,"" he said. ""People have been through the lockdown. At some point, all of us need something near normal. I still think people have that desire to have a look at the product."" Things were a little slower at bespoke suit and shirt maker Dege & Skinner, situated on London's historic tailoring street, Savile Row. The 155-year-old business opened its doors for the first time in three months on Monday - but by appointment only. Managing director William Skinner - a fifth-generation tailor - said he had seen two customers on Monday. And he expects the rest of the week to be similarly slow. Normally, he would have about 75 appointments a month in the diary and then he would welcome walk-ins on top of that. ""But,"" he said, ""this is the first official week back. People have been waiting to do this and they're quite excited to carry on the process of having their clothes made."" He does not think demand will return to normal until people are able to fly more easily. ""We need to travel a lot with our business,"" said Mr Skinner, whose employees cross the world to meet clients, take measurements and fit suits. They also travel to see him. ""In the meantime, we'll just have to rely on sending them patterns and them ordering clothes over the internet,"" he said. David Edwards, senior interior designer at furniture store BoConcept, in Manchester, said his first day back to work was ""busy"" but enjoyable. ""We've changed the way we're operating, so we're just doing appointments only,"" he said. That typically means a couple seeking to spruce up their home in the midst of lockdown will have the entire shop to themselves for an hour, guided round by a shop assistant and provided with gloves, masks and hand sanitiser. After each appointment, the showroom is cleaned, ready for the next visit. Obviously customers who have an hour to spare are mostly committed to making a purchase. Mr Edwards says some of the people in the shop for the first day's trading were looking at ""full living-room projects"", involving new sofas, coffee tables, lamps and other accessories. Some of these were being worked on during lockdown and are now close to completion, so the customers have come to see the final plans. Others had more modest needs: ""They moved into somewhere just before lockdown and just want a few key pieces,"" he said. He added: ""We've had about 10 customers in today. We've asked them about it, and they feel it's a relaxed, enjoyable shopping experience."" Alex Robertson owns the Head in the Clouds zero-waste shop in Bishop Auckland, County Durham. It sells a range of sustainable food and cleaning products, as well as plastic-free gifts. ""It was really nice to have everyone back,"" she said. ""Everyone was taking it seriously and being quite conscientious."" Ms Robertson has introduced a one-way system in her shop and allows no more than two family groups in at a time. Anti-bacterial wipes and hand sanitiser are provided for customers. ""It was really busy. We sold quite a lot of things,"" she said. ""We had one or two people that were just coming in to look, but most people were there for a purpose."" Ms Robertson says she caters to people with a ""shop local"" ethos who want to know where their goods come from. ""In my business, especially, a lot of people don't want to shop online,"" she said, adding: ""They know they can get what they want here in the city centre."""
23,Black Lives Matter: Have racial inequality reviews led to action?,"A number of reviews have looked at race and equality over the years, but has the government taken action?","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:47:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53053661,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced he will set up a new commission to look at all ""aspects of inequality."" However, David Lammy, the shadow justice secretary, has criticised the plan for a Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities. He said the government should focus instead on implementing recommendations from existing reviews. So, what has already been said about race and inequality, and have previous reviews led to government action? In 2018, Wendy Williams, a prominent member of the police watchdog body, was asked to look into the events leading up to the Windrush scandal, in which a number of people were wrongly deported by the Home Office. The review, which was published in March this year, made 30 recommendations including: The Home Office was asked to publish a ""comprehensive improvement plan within six months of the report"", taking account of all the recommendations. It has only been three months since the review was released, and Ms Williams said she would review progress in 18 months. The Home Secretary Priti Patel said she had been ""deeply moved"" by the report and that she would ""review and reflect on the recommendations."" In 2016, David Lammy was asked to lead a government-backed review into the treatment of black and minority ethnic (BAME) individuals in the criminal justice system in England and Wales. The final report made 35 recommendations, including: The Ministry of Justice says 16 of the recommendations have been implemented, but has not given us the details of which ones. Six recommendations were rejected at the time of the report's release. Mr Lammy says there is still work to be done in three main areas - diversity in the judiciary, criminal records and youth justice, with the latter the biggest cause for concern. In the most recent statistics, black children were over four times more likely to be arrested than white children, and BAME individuals represented half of all young people in custody. % of young people in custody by ethnicity in England and Wales Recommendations on reforming Youth Offender Panels have not been implemented in full. The government rejected a suggestion that magistrates should follow an agreed number of cases in the Youth Justice System from start to finish, to increase their understanding of the area. The Ministry of Justice admits that more needs to be done in this area. The government also rejected the recommendation that the judiciary should be representative of the population as a whole, by 2025. % of judges in England and Wales The review recommended the adoption of the system for sealing criminal records used in many US states, with a presumption to look favourably on those who committed crimes at a young age, but can demonstrate that they have changed since their conviction. The government says it is still considering this, along with recommendations on criminal records made by other groups, including parliament's justice committee. The McGregor-Smith review looked into issues affecting BAME groups in the workplace in the UK. It found that they were under-employed and under-promoted. ""In many organisation, the processes, in place, from the point of recruitment through to progression to the very top, remain favourable to a select group of individuals,"" it said. Its 26 recommendations included: The government agreed with many of the recommendations, but said it hoped ""reasonable employers in the UK will rise to the challenges"", leaving it to private companies to implement changes. On introducing legislation for larger bodies to release diversity data, the government said it believed a ""non-legislative solution is the right approach for now"". A 2018 update to the review, including a survey of businesses, found that little had changed in the year since the review, with the exception of increased mentoring. The Angiolini Review of deaths in police custody found that, while the death rate of black individuals arrested was not disproportionate to white people in England, the proportion of deaths involving use of force was. It also found that mental health and intoxication was a major factor in deaths in police custody, meaning black people with mental health issues often suffered ""double discrimination"". Only a handful of the 110 recommendations were specific to race: The government's response or progress update did not make specific reference to deaths in police custody involving minority groups. However, the Independent Office for Police Conduct noted it had reviewed guidance on handling allegations of discrimination. It has also given a better breakdown of data in the past two years. Other reports have highlighted institutional discrepancies for BAME groups in the past including: Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
24,Atatiana Jefferson: 'Why I will no longer call the police',"When James Smith called police to check his neighbour was OK, she ended up dead. Never again, he says.","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:29:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53052917,"James Smith has never wanted much to do with the police but he called them to check on his neighbour in the Texas city of Fort Worth, because it was late at night and her front door was wide open. Soon afterwards he heard a gunshot, and later saw the dead body of a 28-year-old woman, his neighbour's daughter, carried out on a stretcher. James Smith is angry, hurt and tired. Every death of a black person at the hands of a police officer takes him back to the moment in October when Atatiana Jefferson was killed. ""I have to live with this guilt, with this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my years,"" he says. Because he was the reason that the police were there that night. At around 02:30 on 12 October he was woken by his niece and nephew, who told him the front door of their neighbour's house was wide open and the lights were on. The owner of the house, Yolanda Carr, had a heart condition and had recently been in and out of intensive care, so Smith was worried something had happened to her. He went across the road and noticed the lawnmower and other gardening equipment were still plugged in, which he thought was strange. So he dialled a number in the phone book to request a ""wellness check"" - expecting that a police officer would come out, knock on the door and check the family was OK. He didn't know that Carr was in hospital that night and that her daughter and grandson were up late playing video games. He was standing directly opposite the house when the police arrived. One of the officers, Aaron Dean, had his gun drawn as he approached the front door and then walked around the side of the house to the back garden. Seconds later there was a gunshot. ""When that bullet went off I heard her spirit say, 'Don't let them get away with it,'"" Smith says. ""And that's pretty much why I stayed out there all night long until they brought her out."" Police soon filled the street, but they wouldn't tell him what had happened. It wasn't until they wheeled a body out six hours later that he knew Yolanda Carr's daughter, Atatiana Jefferson, had been killed. The two families were still getting to know each other. Yolanda Carr had bought the house four years earlier and was fiercely proud of it. Her house is separated from James Smith's by a road and their wide, green, manicured lawns. Smith is a veteran of the neighbourhood. He's raised children and grandchildren there, and five members of his family still live on the same street. Keeping the yard straight is like a ritual in the area, he says, one that Atatiana's family had been quick to adopt. He describes Yolanda Carr as a hard-working lady. ""She had some problems in life that she overcame and her home was her trophy."" Atatiana had been staying in the house while her mother was unwell. She was saving for medical school while caring for her mother and her eight-year-old nephew. A few days before the killing there had been a car crash on the street, James Smith remembers. Atatiana rushed out to help, and she stayed with the people in the car until the ambulance came. That was just her nature, he says. ""She intended to become a doctor,"" he says, before going silent for a moment. ""But that's not going to happen now."" Sometimes he would mow their lawn for them, Atatiana would bring him water and they'd chat. The day that she died she had been mowing the lawn herself, showing her nephew how to do it. On the footage from the officer's body cam, released after she was killed, officer Aaron Dean can be seen walking up to a window at the back of the house, where Atatiana briefly appears. ""Put your hands up, show me your hands!"" he shouts. He has barely finished speaking when he fires through the window. He never declared he was a police officer. Aaron Dean resigned before he could be fired. He was quickly arrested and in December he was indicted for murder, but the trial has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Fort Worth police chief Ed Kraus said he ""could not make sense"" of why Atatiana Jefferson had to lose her life. In a press conference he seemed emotional as he spoke about the damage that her death had done to relations between the police and the community. But James Smith doesn't find any of this reassuring. Atatiana's death has destroyed what little faith he had in law enforcement. ""We don't have a relationship with the police because we don't trust the police,"" he says. ""So if we can stay out of their way, we're fine."" He's more reluctant than ever to call them. Recently, when his sister heard gunshots in the neighbourhood she asked him to call 911, but he refused. ""It's an experience that unfortunately, you would have to be a person of colour to understand,"" he says. ""I don't buy the police kneeling and hugging people, because we've been kneeling and hugging and praying for 60 years."" He doesn't feel that the case against Aaron Dean is being pursued properly. It troubles him that no-one from law enforcement has come to speak to him since the night of the shooting. It's his belief that if he hadn't spoken to the media the following morning, Atatiana's death might not have been investigated. He's also upset with the pace of the trial. ""With the pandemic going on they said it could be 2021 before this thing starts. On the other hand, had it been a person or colour we'd be tried, convicted and have started our sentence already,"" he says. ""We're still holding our breath. Pardon the phrase, but we can't breathe."" There are about 1,000 ""officer-involved shootings"" in which someone is killed every year in the US. These statistics are not centrally collected but various organisations and researchers have been compiling the data, mostly from media reports. According to one of these organisations, Mapping Police Violence, in 2019 black people represented 24% of those killed by police despite making up only 13% of the population. Dr Philip Stinson of Bowling Green State University has also compiled an extensive database on police crime and, analysing cases where police have been arrested, has found that police crimes against black people tend to involve violence more often than police crimes against other races. Convictions for these crimes are rare. Between 2013 and 2019, Mapping Police Violence recorded more than 7,500 cases in which officers shot and killed someone, but according to Stinson's database only 71 were charged with murder or manslaughter and only 23 were convicted of a crime related to the killing. Since 2005, Stinson calculates, only five non-federal police officers have been convicted of murder. When James Smith went on TV to talk about his neighbour's death he learned that this was the seventh officer-involved shooting of 2019 in Fort Worth, a city of less than one million people. But shootings are only part of the problem. In the midst of the George Floyd protests in early June, a Fort Worth police officer called Tiffany Bunton spoke out about the death of her uncle in police custody two years ago. Christopher Lowe died in the back of a police vehicle after being detained by two officers. The body camera footage of his arrest shows officers dragging him to their car. It's disturbing to watch. Though he's compliant throughout the arrest, the officers taunt Lowe as he struggles to stand up and to walk. He tells them he's sick. ""I can't breathe,"" he says, ""I'm dying."" ""Don't pull that [expletive],"" the officer says. And later, ""If you spit on me bud I'm going to put your face in the [expletive] dirt."" Thirteen minutes later Lowe was found dead of a drug overdose in the back of the car. Tiffany Bunton believes his death could have been prevented if the officers had called an ambulance, instead of ignoring his symptoms and insulting him when he told them he was unwell. Five officers were fired in January 2019, as a result. A year later two of them got their jobs back. When I asked James Smith if he was familiar with this case he simply replied, ""That's what we go through. So we avoid the police as best we can."" Two weeks after Atatiana's funeral, her father, Marquis Jefferson, died from a heart attack. His brother believes it was grief that killed him. Her mother Yolanda Carr was in hospital the night her daughter was killed and was too sick to attend her funeral. In January she was well enough to return home, and James Smith said he'd treat her to lunch. He was waiting for the barbecue place to open when an ambulance screeched down the street and parked outside the house. He rushed over and found paramedics trying to resuscitate her. She was wearing a T-shirt covered in portraits of her daughter, and lying on a cushion that Smith had given her, decorated with a print of Atatiana's face. In early June the mayor of Fort Worth, Betsy Price put out a statement on the death of George Floyd - who was killed in Minneapolis when officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. In the statement the mayor mentioned Floyd by name but referred to Atatiana only as Fort Worth's ""own tragedy"". ""She didn't even mention Atatiana's name,"" Smith says. It felt like a knife being twisted in his gut. As he watches protests all over the country in response to George Floyd's death, he wonders why people didn't respond to the killing of Atatiana in the same way. ""The quieter we are the more likely that Atatiana is forgotten and I don't want her forgotten,"" he says. On 19 June Atatiana's remaining family - her sisters and brothers - are launching a foundation in her honour, funded by donations they received in the wake of her death. The Atatiana Project will focus on education and on improving relations between the police and the community. It will be based in the house where Atatiana was shot. On Facebook, James Smith proudly posts pictures of a wall in his home, filled with framed photos of his children, nieces and nephews in their graduation gowns and mortarboard hats. They're smiling, holding rolled up bachelors and masters' degrees. He and Yolanda Carr should be American success stories. A postal worker and a nurse who worked hard, saved money, educated their children and bought beautiful homes on a quiet street to enjoy into their old age. But James Smith is not sure if he can be happy in this neighbourhood again. ""I look through my dining room window and I see Atatiana's house. When I wash my dishes I look out of my window I see Atatiana's house. When I sit on my back deck I see Atatiana's house."" And every time the image of that night comes back to him. ""I'm going to see these people coming across the street and going to the back of the house and bang! I'm going to see this when my great-grandchildren are born… when I'm sitting on a rocking chair."" Robert Jones was arrested in 1992, accused of killing a young British tourist in New Orleans. Four years later, he went on trial - by this time another man had already been convicted of the crime, but he was prosecuted anyway. The judge who sentenced the young father to life in prison now says his skin colour sealed his fate. Locked up for 23 years - when the real killer had already been jailed (2015)"
25,The lengths countries go to for a seat at UN top table,"Canada, Norway and Ireland are in a tight race for two non-permanent seats on the security council.","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 20:23:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52973244,"Glad-handing, parties and concerts by U2 and Celine Dion - how countries campaign for a seat on the United Nations Security Council. It likely won't come down to the gift bags or the parties but that doesn't mean Canada, Norway and Ireland are leaving it to chance. From Norway, General Assembly delegations will get a badge covered with fabric from the tapestry used to decorate the council chamber's walls. Canada is offering greeting cards, chocolates, and Canada-branded facemasks. The small tokens for delegations ahead of the 17 June vote come after lengthy campaigns by the three nations for one of two coveted non-permanent seats up for grabs on the security council, which is tasked with ensuring global peace and security, The seats they are campaigning for are set aside for the ""Western Europe and Others"" [WEOG] regional grouping on the council. The winners will serve a two-year term on the 15-member body. *There is some strong language at the end of this article* Campaign season for the contested seats means ""a lot of parties, a lot of events"" at the UN's headquarters in New York, says Stephanie Fillion, a journalist who covers the global body for news site PassBlue. Campaigns can be elaborate affairs with slick promotional materials and plenty of wining and dining, and countries announce they will run years in advance. In 2018, Ireland invited diplomats to a New York concert by Irish rockers U2, and Canada did something similar for a concert by Canadian songstress Celine Dion this year. Canada says it's shelled out roughly $1.74m (£1.37m) and has 13 full-time staff working on the campaign. And as of late last year, Ireland spent a reported $800,000 and Norway $2.8m. Member states get three things in return for a seat, says Adam Chapnick, a professor of defence studies at the Royal Military College of Canada. Those are access, relevance and influence. ""For two years, day in and day out, a country that is not a great power will have direct access to the five permanent members in addition to whomever else might be on the council at that time,"" he says. He adds: ""With that access comes relevance."" ""All of a sudden you're really popular around the world because if somebody else can't reach the Chinese or the Americans or the French, they know you can."" The council has significant responsibilities. It can authorise peacekeeping operations, impose international sanctions, and determine how the UN should respond to conflicts around the world. But the council isn't always in the mood to collaborate, says Mr Chapnick. ""There are times when you can actually change the international rules of the game and there are other times where you absolutely can't. And that's entirely unpredictable."" In 2010, Canada suffered its first ever defeat for a seat on the council. Portugal, a small European nation in economic turmoil at the time, pulled off an upset victory, and Germany won the other open seat. In Canada, that defeat became a political debate, with opposition parties blaming the then governing Conservatives for what they saw as an embarrassing failure. ""In some ways the Portuguese won, in other ways Canada lost,"" says Mr Chapnick. Portugal not only ran a strong campaign but actively campaigned against Canada, recruiting allies against its bid. Canada's bid did have flaws, he says, including getting serious about the campaign late in the game. It also faced scepticism from African delegations after closing some embassies on the continent. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals later vowed the party would rectify that unsuccessful bid, announcing Canada was ""back"" on the world stage. Good campaigns usually have a few things in common, says Mr Chapnick. Contenders will have a well-regarded representative at UN headquarters in New York, one with a close relationship with his or her home capital. The campaigns are well-funded and often have an engaged head of government or state, or senior cabinet members, involved in the pitch. Mr Trudeau has spent part of this year on the campaign trail, trying to secure votes from Caribbean and Africa countries during February overseas trips. He recently co-hosted a UN panel on the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Chapnick says it's positively viewed when competing nations show a commitment increasing their international engagement. Norway, Ireland and Canada are all pitching their commitment to matters like climate change, multilateralism and peacekeeping. Ireland is pushing the idea that ""you can get everything you need from choosing a middle power like Canada or Norway"" so the small island nation of Ireland brings a unique voice to the table, he says. He sums up Norway's broad line as ""Canada says we're back, Norway says 'we never left'"". Canada has shifted its message in recent months during the pandemic, to ""in a time of global crisis it's helpful to have another G7 country at the table"". Ms Fillion says: it's ""important to keep in mind when you look at the vote is there is so much that countries take into account in order to cast their ballots"". It could be a strong bilateral relationship that one campaigning country's managed to build with a counterpart. There are also vote swaps, when one country will support a bid in return for a favourable vote for a seat on another UN body. Recent elections have been less focused on international reputation - countries do highlight contributions to development aid and peacekeeping operations - and more transactional  in nature, says Mr Chapnick. It's ""I don't care how much foreign aid you provide, how much of it goes to me"". All the factors coming into play makes the results difficult to predict, says Ms Fillion, though she has heard talk that either Norway or Ireland are currently in the lead. Canada, distracted early on by the election of US President Donald Trump and subsequent free trade renegotiations with the US and Mexico, seems to have rallied in recent months, she says. Not all regional seats are contested races  - many groups run slates. In the last decade, nearly 80% of elections for council seats went uncontested. Mr Chapnick is critical of the members of the Western Europe and Others group for competing for the seat as a rule instead of reaching some  sharing agreement. He says it's ""not in anyone's interests"" to have multiyear campaigns where countries ""have to go shill all sorts of countries that aren't friendly to us"" for a seat. There are five permanent members - China, France, Russian, the UK, and the US - and 10 non-permanent members. Elections for five seats are held every year. Non-permanent members include two WEOG members, five Asian or African members, two Latin American members, and one east European member. Due to the coronavirus pandemic member states will not be in the General Assembly hall during the elections but will instead each be given a time slot to cast their secret ballot. To win a seat, a country needs to secure the  support of at least two thirds of the General Assembly delegations that are voting. In the past, countries thought they had secured a seat only to find once the secret ballots are cast, promises of support never materialised. A former Australian ambassador to the UN dubbed it the ""rotten lying bastards"" phenomenon after losing a bid in the 1990s."
26,Navajo Nation: The people battling America's worst coronavirus outbreak,The challenges of life in the Navajo Nation have made containing Covid-19 even more difficult.,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:07:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52941984,"When Valentina Blackhorse tested positive for coronavirus, she texted her sister and told her not to worry. A former pageant queen, Valentina was known for her love of her Native American Navajo heritage, her passion for helping others and her playful sense of humour. She doted on her one-year-old daughter, Poet, and worked as a government administrator, with dreams of leading her people some day as Navajo president. When coronavirus reached the reservation on which she lived, Valentina warned her family to stay indoors and take precautions. Weeks later her boyfriend Bobby fell ill and she tended to him at their home in Kayenta, a small town near the sandstone buttes of Arizona's Monument Valley. She'd lived with rheumatoid arthritis her whole life, but soon her joint pain started to feel different, and breathing wasn't so easy. She took herself for a test and the results came back a week later, confirming her fears. The next day, when Valentina's breathing got worse, Bobby rushed her to a health clinic. She died hours later, aged 28. ""She overcame a lot of things in her life,"" said her sister, Vanielle. ""I thought she was strong enough to pull through."" Valentina was one of the youngest victims of coronavirus in the Navajo Nation, a Native American reservation grappling with what is America's worst outbreak. Since Covid-19 was first reported in the Nation on 15 March, infection rates per capita have grown to be the highest in the country when compared with any individual state. As of 14 June, 6,611 cases have been confirmed. More than 300 people have died after contracting the virus as well - a toll higher than 15 states. The Navajo Nation is the largest reservation of its kind, in both size and population. More than 173,000 people live within its borders, in pockets of communities spread across the deserts and canyons of Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. If it were a state, the Nation would be larger than 10 others. The Navajo - or Diné, as they call themselves - have lived in the region for centuries, but the Navajo Nation is an American construct. After US expansion forced thousands of Navajo to leave their homes, America carved out a stretch of land where they could maintain some sovereignty. In return, the federal government pledged to support its people with funding for education, healthcare and other services. The Navajo have contributed much to America's development. Perhaps most famously, Navajo soldiers invented a military code, based on their language, that kept American communications secure during World War Two. But as coronavirus has swept through the reservation, it has underscored many of the social and economic inequalities that continue to affect the tribe - all contributing to one another, and all making the outbreak worse. ""If we had better resources, maybe [Valentina] would still be alive,"" said Vanielle. Many residents struggle with money. The reservation's unemployment rate is approximately 40%, and a similar number live below the poverty line, earning less than $12,760 (£10,191) a year. These factors exacerbate health problems among the Navajo and a third of the population suffers from diabetes, heart conditions and lung disease. In some cases, people have fallen ill after years of radiation exposure from hundreds of abandoned uranium mines dotted around the desert. Severely limited access to healthy food also plays a role. The Navajo Nation spans 71,000 sq km (27,413 sq miles) but has only 13 grocery stores, forcing many residents to drive for hours to towns outside the reservation with better facilities. It is common for people from different households to travel in one vehicle during these excursions because they are unable to afford petrol, further heightening their risk of catching coronavirus. Relief efforts have been hampered by limited healthcare resources, too. The reservation's dozen medical facilities hold just 200 hospital beds - approximately one bed for every 900 residents, and a third the national rate. As a result, some coronavirus patients have been moved to makeshift quarantine facilities, while others have been transferred to hospitals outside the reservation. Many homes are multi-generational as well, making it easier for the virus to spread to elderly and vulnerable residents. A third of households have no access to running water or electricity either, making it hard for thousands of people to wash their hands regularly and to stave off infection. ""This is something that is year-round, it's been going on since we were put on reservations,"" says Emma Robbins, head of Dig Deep, a charity that's delivering bottled water and improving access to running water in the Nation. Ms Robbins was born on the reservation. She now lives nearly 600km (373 miles) away in Los Angeles, California, but is unable to return due to travel restrictions. ""I fear for my family and I fear for my friends,"" she told the BBC, tearfully. ""Hearing these stories and not being able to go home is really hard and I feel so hopeless."" But despite their hardship, Ms Robbins says she feels frustrated by the tone of victimhood that often colours discussions about her tribe. ""It's really trendy to do things surrounding the Navajo Nation in terms of 'Oh look how bad it is here,' but I don't think people highlight enough of the amazing efforts on the ground and the positivity,"" she adds. In response to the outbreak, the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs told the BBC it had taken ""unprecedented actions to support Indian Country,"" providing the Navajo with protective equipment, contamination trailers, and other technical assistance. The Navajo Nation has also received $600m under the CARES Act, a $2tn economic stimulus package to shore up local economies and communities during the pandemic. But local authorities only received the money a month after the bill was signed into law. In the meantime, the Navajo and 10 other tribes successfully sued the US Treasury over funding disparities in the CARES Act for Native American groups. In the midst of federal funding delays, the Navajo Nation had to rely on donations and its own resources in the crucial early weeks of the outbreak. Navajo President Jonathan Nez has co-ordinated the distribution of food and medical supplies to local residents, and introduced some of the strictest lockdown measures in the US - until recently, imposing a 57-hour weekend curfew. Locals are stepping in to help as well. More than $4.7m has been raised through a crowdfunding campaign started by Ethel Branch, a former Navajo attorney general. In an unusual twist, thousands of dollars have come from donors in Ireland - many paying respect to Choctaw Indians who, in 1847, donated $170 towards relief efforts in Ireland during the Great Hunger. With help from volunteers, Ms Branch has used the donations to deliver food, water and hand sanitiser to more than half the reservation's residents. But poor infrastructure has presented a challenge at times. ""There's one community that's really isolated and we're trying to figure out how to get food there,"" she told the BBC. ""The easiest way would be to go directly, but it's all dirt road, and if we stick to the pavement, that adds on another hour and a half."" Language barriers have also been a deciding factor in the Navajo Nation's response to the outbreak. As with all public communications, it shares coronavirus updates in the Navajo language as well as English. This is driven by desires to maintain cultural heritage, but is a practical step as well because some residents speak only Navajo, or have limited English skills. In Navajo, coronavirus is translated as Dikos Ntsaaígíí-19, or Big Cough-19. But several residents have told the BBC they believe this translation downplays the severity of coronavirus. Among them is Agnes Attakai, a Navajo Nation native and a director at the University of Arizona's School of Public Health. She said a renaming should be explored in consultation with traditional Navajo healers. ""You have to be respectful of using the language and not invite the negativity of that particular illness,"" said Ms Attakai. ""Once you start respecting and addressing it appropriately… people will be engaged more to change their behaviours rather than linking it up with cough and pneumonia."" But Navajo President Jonathan Nez said it was ""unfair"" to suggest the translation did not adequately convey the dangers."
27,Marcus Rashford: Food voucher U-turn after footballer's campaign,The Manchester United star praises the government for agreeing to fund free school meals in England this summer.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:05:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53065806,"About 1.3m children in England will be able to claim free school meal vouchers in the summer holidays, after a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford. The Manchester United forward, 22, welcomed the six-week voucher for eligible children, saying: ""Look at what we can do when we come together."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the move was a ""welcome U-turn"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson praised Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". During the coronavirus lockdown the government is providing vouchers to families whose children qualify for free meals. But it had insisted this would not continue outside of term time. This prompted the England squad footballer to pen an open letter to MPs. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Tuesday evening, Mr Rashford said he was ""grateful that the prime minister did change his decision"". The footballer said he spoke with Mr Johnson on the phone earlier and that the PM thanked him ""for using what I've built in a positive manner"". ""He was just grateful that someone had an opinion and shared it with people,"" Mr Rashford added. ""Being that voice for people who didn't really have the platform to speak out as much as they would like to."" At the daily coronavirus briefing in Downing Street, Mr Johnson said: ""I talked to Marcus Rashford today and congratulated him on his campaign which to be honest I only became aware of very recently, today - and I thank him for what he's done."" ""Clearly free schools meals should generally apply in term time... but we have to understand the pressure that families are under right now,"" he said. ""It will help the kids from the families that really need it."" All children eligible for free school meals in term time in England will benefit from the ""Covid summer food fund"", Downing Street said. Scotland and Wales will also continue with the voucher programme, while Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said she will be proposing that the scheme be extended over the summer ""if the necessary finances can be secured"". The support in England works out at about £15 a week per recipient, and will cost around £120m. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said he was told this was ""additional funding agreed by the Treasury"". In a statement ""to all MPs"" posted on Twitter, Mr Rashford said he was ""thankful"" that they had given families ""one less thing to worry about"". I don’t even know what to say.Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020. End of Twitter post  by @MarcusRashford For weeks, campaigners have been calling for free school meals to be offered during the holidays. Many families whose children qualify for free meals have since the lockdown began been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth £15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. Almost 1.3 million school children in England - accounting for 15.4% of state-educated pupils - were eligible for and claiming free school meals in January 2019, according to the latest available data. Last year's figures showed the need was greatest in parts of London, the north and Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were getting the free meals. The prime minister's official spokesman said the food vouchers to cover the six-week holiday period were a response to the ""unique circumstances of the pandemic"" and would not continue beyond the summer. Referring to Mr Rashford, he added: ""The PM welcomes his contribution to the debate around poverty and respects the fact that he has been using his profile as a leading sportsman to highlight important issues."" As a striker with a killer instinct in front of goal, Marcus Rashford is used to beating defences. And he's cut straight through a nervous defensive wall of Conservative ministers - leaving them wrong-footed and facing an embarrassing own goal. A number of Tory MPs had already voiced their disquiet - and how many of them really wanted to find themselves up against an England football hero, and the risk of children going hungry? The U-turn means the government will pay the extra £120m to extend free school meal vouchers across the six weeks of the holidays, available to 1.3 million children. It's a one-off deal for the unprecedented pressure caused by the coronavirus - with food banks warning of growing demands. But Mr Rashford, and his 2.7 million Twitter followers, proved a tough target for the government - and he's beaten them with a fast-footed appeal directly to public opinion. Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey was widely criticised for a comment she made in response to Mr Rashford's campaign. Mr Rashford had asked others to think about struggling parents who have had their ""water turned off"", and whose children have gone hungry. Ms Coffey replied to his Twitter thread on free school meals, saying ""water cannot be disconnected"" - prompting the footballer to say he was ""concerned"" she had only acknowledged part of his message. Among Tory MPs praising the U-turn was Tim Loughton, who said he was ""delighted"" the government had ""listened to Conservative backbenchers"". Opposition parties also welcomed the move - while Manchester United said Mr Rashford was a ""hero"". This is another welcome u-turn from Boris Johnson.The thought of 1.3 million children going hungry this summer was unimaginable.Well done to @MarcusRashford and many others who spoke out so powerfully about this issue. #HolidaysWithoutHunger End of Twitter post  by @Keir_Starmer NEW: Govt have u-turned on free school meals after a compelling campaign.@MarcusRashford: this result will change the lives of hundreds of thousands of children. Thank you. 👏🏾 https://t.co/Ux9RYIhwjh End of Twitter post  by @SadiqKhan The children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, who wrote to the chancellor about the issue last week, said she was pleased ministers had ""seen sense and changed their minds"". Sonja from near Basingstoke, who has three teenage children, said the government's change of heart was ""wonderful"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live Drive she found herself out of work and relying on benefits because of the pandemic. The free school meals vouchers have been a lifeline so far, Sonja says, adding that she was grateful to Mr Rashford for his campaign. ""[The U-turn] takes away that worry of the six-week summer holiday and makes it so much less stressful."" she said. But she added: ""I feel sad that it had to be a campaign. They have been throwing money to keep everyone afloat but left behind people on universal credit and free school meals."" Dev Sharma, Youth MP for Leicestershire, said the vouchers have been a safety net for his family and expressed his delight the government has decided to fund them over the summer after all. The 15-year-old said the move ""means the world"" to him and his brother ""to know that my mum and dad have now sufficient funds to feed [us] over six weeks"". ""I can now have access to a decent meal and be on the same level as my peers from more affluent backgrounds,"" he said. Several charities have praised Mr Rashford's campaign. Andrew Forsey, chief executive of Feeding Britain, said the footballer has ""done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots"". But Helen Barnard, acting director of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government's scheme ""only covers a minority of children in poverty and the pressures are much wider than just school meals"". She said ""soaring numbers of families"" were having to rely on foodbanks to get through the pandemic, even with the voucher scheme in place. Does you child qualify for free school meals?

28,Coronavirus: What's happening to free school meals this summer?,The government in England will now provide free school meals vouchers over the summer holidays.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:26:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53053337,"The government in England has agreed to extend a voucher scheme for children on free school meals during the summer holidays, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford and others. It had previously insisted the scheme would finish at the end of the summer term.  Scotland and Wales will also continue with the voucher programme. So, who is eligible for free school meals and how do they work? Free school meals have been at least partially funded by the government for more than a century, because of concerns about malnourishment and children being too hungry to concentrate during lessons. Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible, from government-maintained nurseries through to sixth forms. Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. New claims made from April 2018 in England must come from households earning a maximum income of £7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. It's the same in Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland the household income threshold is £14,000 In England and Scotland, all infant state school pupils (those in Reception and in Years 1 and 2) can get free school meals during term time. If a child qualifies for school meals they remain eligible until they finish the phase of school they're in as of 31 March 2022, whether primary or secondary. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of state-educated pupils. In Manchester, where Marcus Rashford grew up, the figure is 28.1% The take-up was greatest in parts of London, the north of England and the Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were receiving free school meals.Who gets free school meals? The majority of children have not been at school during the coronavirus pandemic. This has prompted concerns that those eligible for free school meals could ""fall through the cracks"" and go hungry. In recent years, free school meals have been linked to lowering obesity levels, and boosting academic achievement for poorer pupils. During term time, the government in England expects schools to support pupils eligible for free school meals through an alternative scheme, such as: Many families have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth £15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. But the system has suffered problems including schools struggling to log on, parents being unable to download vouchers and some saying the vouchers failed when they tried to use them. The programme, which has cost more than £129m since lockdown began, also ran throughout the Easter and May half-term holidays. Calling for the government in England to change its decision, Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford said his family had once relied on free school meals. ""The system isn't built for families like mine to succeed,"" he said. Campaigners had also threatened legal action against the government if it didn't extending the food voucher scheme. Reversing the decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". A ""Covid summer food fund"" will now offer six-week food vouchers to children eligible for free school meals in England during the holidays."
29,Coronavirus: Who should wear a face mask or face covering?,Face coverings are becoming compulsory for people using public transport in England.,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 16:12:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,"Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line with new World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering from Monday - to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The new rules coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class of some secondary school pupils and the reopening of non-essential shops. The number of people using public transport is expected to increase. The government stresses people should: Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules including: If it is ""reasonably necessary"" for you to eat or drink you can remove the face covering to do so. The rules will apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry will ask people to cover their face as they enter a station. People could be refused travel if they don't follow the rules. They could also be fined, but this will be the last resort. Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory. Similar advice has been given by Northern Ireland's first minister and deputy first minister. In Scotland, it is recommended you consider using face coverings in limited circumstances - such as public transport - as a precautionary measure. The government has been careful to use the term ""face covering"" rather than ""face mask"". Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home"" - with surgical masks kept for medical use. Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings. The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings from Monday - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary. NHS England has now lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts. Health staff already wear masks in clinical areas within 2m (6ft) of a patient - but they will now have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments. It says they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"". The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments. The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them. Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease. There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice."
30,Coronavirus UK map: How many confirmed cases are there in your area?,Key graphics explaining how coronavirus has spread in the UK and the government's response.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:20:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,"There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 41,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS) show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. Death certificates mentioning the virus suggest there had been more than 50,000 deaths by 5 June, according to ONS figures. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for this time of year, the toll rises to more than 64,000 by the same date. Some of these deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Coronavirus accounted for about 14% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 5 June, according to death registration data - a drop from 18% the previous week. In the week to 17 April, when deaths from the virus reached their peak, this figure was just under 40%.

The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil. However, the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons. On Tuesday, the government announced a further 233 deaths. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with 37,524 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. In Scotland, the official government figure for deaths remains 2,453, but data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests it had reached nearly 4,000 by 7 June. In Wales, the death toll stands at 1,456 while Northern Ireland has recorded 542. Last week's figures from the ONS show that while the number of reported deaths in the UK for the week to 5 June rose slightly, it remains close to the normal range for the time of year. The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. The government says the R number is between 0.8 and 1.0 in most English regions - but between 0.8 and 1.1 in the South West. The estimate for Scotland is between 0.6 and 0.8. In Northern Ireland, it is between 0.5 and 0.9, while it is between 0.7 and 1.0 in Wales. The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. The number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in April and the seven-day rolling average shows a clear downward trend. A further 1,279 cases were announced on Tuesday, an increase on Monday's figure of 1,056 new infections. The latest ONS estimates suggest there could be some 4,500 cases per day in England alone, not including those in hospitals and care homes. Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance has said the epidemic ""is shrinking, but not fast,"" suggesting this means moving ""very carefully"" out of lockdown. Cases were originally concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but Wales and parts of Scotland and the North East of England have also seen a high proportions of cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the possibility that there could be ""local lockdowns"" in the future to control the spread of the virus. The UK exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. However, the UK Statistics Authority has criticised how the data has been presented, saying the aim appeared to be to show ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he would look at ways the information could be ""improved"". The government announced there were 113,107 tests processed or posted in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Tuesday. This figure does not represent the number of people tested, as some are tested more than once. At least two million people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK - but the government has been unable to provide an updated figure for that since 22 May. Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with NHS England figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has found that people from ethnic minorities have a much higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did not take into account occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. Asked why the government had not released the scientific advice it had received about the risk to black and minority ethnic people, on Monday the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the government had ""not got to the bottom of all the evidence"".  He said ministers would wait to formulate a clear view before advising the public. He told the daily press briefing on Monday that ministers would wait to formulate a clear view before advising the public. The most deprived parts of England and Wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas, according to the ONS.

31,What shops are open?,"Non-essential shops have reopened in England, but will I be able to buy a book or have a haircut?","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:24:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52808931,"Non-essential shops have reopened in England, as lockdown restrictions are eased. So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are now throwing open their doors to customers again. They opened in Northern Ireland last week. Many have been announcing their plans: DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Shops which reopen must meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines. These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) are likely to be a regular fixture. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meet social distancing measures. In Northern Ireland, all shops are now allowed to open. In Scotland, smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in phase two of its lockdown-easing plan. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says it's likely there will be more details on Thursday. Wales's Economy Minister Ken Skates says he would like to see non-essential shops reopen the week of 22 June if coronavirus cases continue to fall. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers £1.8bn a week in lost sales. However, there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birmingham before their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Locker in the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains. Clothing retailers went into lockdown just after stocking up with spring and summer ranges, which they now need to shift."
32,Coronavirus: Could social distancing of less than two metres work?,The government is under pressure to relax the 2m social distancing rule - but is it safe to do so?,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 09:27:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52522460,"A review into the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule has been commissioned by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He faces increasing pressure from his own MPs and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together, to help businesses after they reopen. However, the government's scientific advisers say that being 1m (just over 3ft) apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m. Some countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks. Others, including the UK, have gone further: In a study published in medical journal The Lancet, scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads. They concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Proximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes. But some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If true, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Prof Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out in Chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But the US Centers for Disease Control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is ""currently uncertain"". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. A crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection. The direction of air flow is also crucial - whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you. And a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference. In a restaurant in China, where nine people caught the virus, the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside. Scientists advising the British government say every workplace or building should assess the risks. And they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible, people should only be closer for short periods of time. Plastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time. Arranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help. And in a growing number of many countries, including all parts of the UK, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged, and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But we still don't know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease. Until that is established, the advice is that the risks are real - and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed."
33,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation rules?,Lockdown rules are changing in England aimed at helping single people cut off from family and friends.,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 12:17:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,"England's lockdown restrictions are easing, with changes aimed at reducing loneliness among people who live alone. Each of the four UK nations has different rules. So what can you do now? From Saturday 13 June, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents with children under 18 - can form an ""exclusive"" support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size - but nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They will not have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can stay overnight. It means, for example, that a single grandparent could pair up with one of their children's households. An adult living alone could mix with their parents, or two single friends living apart could get together. If anyone in the bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in both households must self-isolate. If you don't live on your own, or with children under 18 only, then the rules haven't changed for you. In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a recommended maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. In all countries, children are included in the headcount and social distancing guidelines - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - apply. People in England can exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside. So having a kickabout with a football in the park is allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, with social distancing, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: ""It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet."" Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. In Wales, you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an excuse for garden parties. People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible. Another group, of about 2.5 million people, is categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called ""shielding"". Now those people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again - either with members of their household, or by meeting someone else at a social distance. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. Virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should self-isolate - stay at home and not leave it for any reason. Ask others to drop off food and medicines. If England's NHS Test and Trace team contact you because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
34,Coronavirus: What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work?,"Nine million people have accessed the scheme, which will move to its next phase in July.","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:19:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342,"Almost nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government. The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies. Firms have to start paying towards the scheme from August, and it will close entirely in October. So, if you've been put on furlough, what are your rights? The Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme puts workers on leave but allows them to stay on their company's payroll. Originally, furloughed employees couldn't do any work for their employer, but from 1 July they can go back to work part-time. For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Those workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. Yes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, or when it ends. If they are entitled to redundancy pay it would be calculated based on the amount they earned before furlough. Firms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service. At present, furloughed staff can't do any work for their employer. From July, they can be brought back to work on a part-time basis, In the meantime, they can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to £2,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. The take-up has been significant, with about 8.9 million workers furloughed since March. Employers had made about £19.6bn of furlough claims by 7 June, and the scheme will cost the government an estimated £80bn in total. The scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. Workers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. Companies can top up this pay and must let employees know they have been furloughed. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at £2,500 per employee per month before tax, or £576.92 a week. If employees' pay varies each month, you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than £50,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is offered as a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of £7,500. Applications for a second grant will open in August. Anyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage."
35,Coronavirus: Which schools are reopening for pupils?,"Which children are going back to school, and what about the rest?","Sun, 14 Jun 2020 13:45:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,"Some secondary school pupils in England are due to return on Monday. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements vary widely, with many schools offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years 10 and 12 from Monday. But only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time. Students who do return will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Plans to get all primary pupils in England back for four weeks before the summer holidays have been dropped. But some nursery and pre-school children - plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - started to go back on 1 June. Not all schools have reopened, some due to local council advice and some because they don't have the staff or space to safely accommodate eligible pupils. Some parents have chosen not to send their children back. On 4 June, 659,000 children in England - or 6.9% - are estimated to have been in classes. Many schools have been open throughout lockdown for vulnerable children and those of critical workers across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June to all age groups - but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Plans in England include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could be different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is ""very, very small, but not zero"", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools are not ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says exams will take place in 2021 in England. ""We are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach to this,"" he told MPs.

36,Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?,What do you need to know if you're planning to fly during the Covid-19 pandemic?,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 11:22:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52544307,"A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. More than 200 travel companies have asked for the new rules to be scrapped and some MPs have also voiced concerns. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move would protect public health, now that imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined £100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate. Passengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. Once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Employers should agree future working arrangements with staff before they travel internationally. Those returning from overseas will not be eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms. Anyone arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - does not have to enter quarantine. However, you can't avoid self-isolation by heading to these places first on your way back to the UK - a loophole termed by some as the ""Dublin dodge"". Travellers from these places will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for at least 14 days. The government has also said it is looking into ''international travel corridors'' between the UK and countries with low infection rates and strong healthcare systems. It hopes this could avoid the need for quarantine for travellers between the two. Portugal's foreign minister told the BBC he hoped an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. However, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end. The measures will be reviewed in late June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''. There are a number of groups who are exempt, including: Travellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Fourteen-day quarantine rules apply in destinations including Greece, Canada, the UAE, Australia and New Zealand. Many have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. In Spain, only UK citizens with permanent resident status can enter. From 1 July, Spain will allow some travellers in without quarantining, but this doesn't include the UK. Airlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine ""would effectively kill off air travel"". The British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them ""overzealous"". Virgin Atlantic will restart a handful of routes from 20th July, with more to follow in August. EasyJet will restart a ''small number'' of flights on 15 June, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks. Ryanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports. British Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the new quarantine rules. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? Are you planning to travel to or from the UK?

37,Can I stay with my boyfriend now? And other questions,"Questions about support bubbles, and other coronavirus topics","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 23:39:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51176409,"In some parts of the UK, some people are being allowed to have close contact once again with people from outside their household. BBC News answers questions about who can form a ""support bubble"", and other questions about coronavirus. If you and your boyfriend both live alone and in England, the good news is that from 13 June, you can form a support bubble, which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each other’s company, inside or outside a house. You don’t have to keep a 2m distance from one another, and you can stay overnight at each other’s house. If you are living alone, and your partner is in a shared household (or vice versa), matters get complicated. You can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household, and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household. What this means is that if one of your boyfriend’s housemates has a partner who is - like you - living elsewhere and alone, that couple will be prevented from meeting up. Support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone (or alone with children). If both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households, you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other. You cannot form a support bubble with your boyfriend if he lives in Scotland or Wales, although Northern Ireland has announced that it is also introducing support bubbles from 13 June.. As a single grandparent, you will have the right to form a “support bubble” with your grandson and his family. Under the government’s new guidance, from 13 June your grandson would be able to stay at your home, including overnight, and would not need to keep a 2m distance. However, the complicating factor here is your lodger. Are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other, and are you using separate rooms and facilities? If the answer is yes, then there should be no problem. On the other hand, if you have been using the same kitchen, living room and bathroom, and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger, then you are both effectively part of the same household, and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble. There is no current date for reopening tattoo parlours in the UK, and the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union (TPIU) says it has not received any guidance from the government on when this might happen. In the official guidance on which businesses must stay closed for the present, tattoo parlours are listed in the category of personal care, alongside hairdressers, barbers and beauty and nail salons. Under the plans for easing lockdown, 4 July is the earliest date on which personal care outlets could be allowed to reopen in England. There is no set date in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Extra hygiene measures are certain to be put in place as a condition of reopening - the TPIU says these are likely to include “masks for everyone, visors/goggles for artists and paying more attention to more thorough cleaning between customers and regularly throughout the day”. Caravan parks were told to close at the end of March, along with hotels, B&Bs and other types of holiday accommodation. Although some aspects of the lockdowns, people are still not supposed to stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose. The only exception to this rule is for people for whom a static caravan is their home. The government has said it wants to get England’s tourism sector running again from 4 July onwards “as long as it is safe to do so” but has not released any details of how this will happen. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that self-contained accommodation had a lower risk than other areas, and said, ""I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue."" The situation is clearer in Northern Ireland, where static caravans will be open for business  from 20 July onwards. In Scotland, the tourism industry has been given a conditional date of 15 July for reopening. Caravan parks are currently set to stay closed in Wales until 26 September although the Welsh government is reviewing the situation every three weeks. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford’s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it “probably is likely” that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the “incubation period” - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home. For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many ""silent spreaders"" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many ""silent carriers"" there may be. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you’re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn’t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose – and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. If you’re living with someone who’s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. ""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."" It’s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It’s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There’s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK’s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will ""remain unprecedented"" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to ""long waiters"", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to “pre-Covid-19 levels”. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don’t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don’t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government’s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that ""infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general”. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are ""no restrictions"" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: ""Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes."" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may ""vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe"", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. It depends on a number of factors. ""Typical"" business trips to Germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out ""essential functions"" such as healthcare. A certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case. With the introduction of quarantine restrictions at UK borders from 8 June, returning to the UK will not as straightforward. Anyone entering the UK from that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. There are a number of exemptions to this rule, including UK residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you’re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it’s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. If you’re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of £2,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than £50,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of £7,500. In August, applications will open for a ""second and final"" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of £2,190 a month for another three months (£6,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job ""absolutely cannot be done from home"". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren’t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can’t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth £95.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. The government says that this plan is still on course. At the beginning of lockdown, the government promised to provide laptops and tablets for disadvantaged children and young people, so that they would not fall behind in online learning organised by their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on the Education Select Committee that 200,000 laptops would be delivered, some at the end of May, but most of them in June. On 9 June Mr Williamson told the House of Commons that 100,000 laptops had been distributed, prioritising children who have social workers, and that the government was on schedule to distribute all the computers over the coming month. However, he faced criticism from the opposition that the roll-out was taking too long. Labour MP Meg Hillier said that it was “already late for vulnerable pupils, and with no clear plan about catch-up”. Separate schemes to provide vulnerable children and adults with laptops have been announced in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Although the government has changed its advice on the use of face coverings in public places, it still recommends that face masks or face coverings should not be worn in schools. It adds that face coverings should not be worn in any circumstances by those who are not able to handle them properly (for example, small children or those with special educational needs or disabilities), as they may “inadvertently increase the risk of transmission”. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, told the Times Educational Supplement that face coverings could also have a bad effect on the mental health of some children: “If compulsory masking is going to tip some kids into a bad space after weeks of stressful lockdown, we need to balance that risk with the potential benefits.” Meanwhile, other countries have taken different approaches when reopening schools. In France, for example, face masks are compulsory for teachers and pupils aged 11 and over, but they are not worn in Denmark. There are no current plans to open schools for most pupils during the summer holidays, but the situation varies across the UK. In England, some Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children have gone back, but the government has dropped plans for all primary school pupils to return before the summer. Similarly, some Year 10 and Year 12 students in England will go back from 15 June, but the government has confirmed that secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June for all age groups, but only a third of pupils will be in class at any one time. The summer term has been extended by a week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland won’t be returning until after the summer holidays in August. Across the UK, some vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have been in school throughout the crisis, including during the Easter holidays, but it is not yet clear whether that provision will continue over the summer break. Playgrounds are still closed in England. The next review of lockdown easing is due towards the end of the month, so changes may be considered then. In Scotland, playgrounds are set to reopen from 18 June, when the country moves into phase two of its lockdown-easing plans. There is no date yet for reopening in Wales, while there is no detail on this in Northern Ireland’s recovery plan - but decisions will be delegated to councils, as they are responsible for playgrounds. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you “absolute clarity” on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are “unable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms”. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it’s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a “completions procedure form” from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you’re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a “break clause” which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don’t have a “break clause”, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a “reduced payment plan”. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, “provided they are safe and enforce social distancing”. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: ""We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,"" he said. ""So we are talking about really large numbers of people."" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who’s leading the Church’s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you’re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you’ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you’ve shared a bus or train carriage. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you don’t have to go into quarantine if you’re returning to the UK from what’s known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the ""Dublin dodge"") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt. The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland. The government guidance details what you’ll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work you’ll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you. However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands. Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. What questions do you have about coronavirus?

38,Coronavirus: Five ways shopping will be different from now on,"Shops in England are preparing to welcome customers back but what will the ""new normal"" look like?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 21:01:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53005123,"On Monday, non-essential shops in England will be allowed to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed. This includes retailers offering clothes, toys, books, furniture and electronics. For many people stuck indoors for weeks, it will be a welcome change of scene. But with hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, shopping will not be like it was before 23 March. Here are five ways it will be different from next week. We've all seen the 2m markings and arrows on the floor in supermarkets showing customers how far apart they need to stay and which way to walk, and this will now be the case in other non-essential stores too. People will also be asked to keep a set distance between each other on escalators. At John Lewis, for example, shoppers will be required to stand eight steps behind each other. And only one person at a time will be allowed to use a lift at the department store, unless they are from the same household. At Primark, two people can use a lift but only if they stand on designated spots. There will be hand sanitising stations throughout shops and people will be encouraged to use hand gel when they enter a shop. Shop assistants will look different as well. At Next, employees will wear a protective visor and have the option of wearing an additional mouth and nose mask. Many retailers are also fitting plastic screens at tills. And there will be a lot more cleaning going on - of shopping baskets, door handles, counters and escalator rails. Selfridges is one of the few retailers that will allow people to try clothes on but each fitting room will be sanitised by steaming and antibacterial cleaning after each customer use. Government guidelines recommend people should shop alone where possible so hopes of hitting the stores with friends will have to wait. Some retailers, such as Primark, will allow a group of people into their shops from Monday but they must be from the same household. They will also have to follow social distancing rules once they are inside the branch. Dan Simms, co-head of the UK retail agency team at Colliers International, reckons ""the younger demographic will take advantage of the lifting of restrictions to socialise and visit retail destinations"". But that is not expected to happen immediately from Monday as at the moment six people from different households are only allowed to meet outside. And some shopping malls, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre and others owned by Intu, have removed indoor seating areas to ""support social distancing"" and ""to discourage people from gathering"". Meanwhile, stopping for a coffee with a friend or sitting down for a bite to eat will be limited because some stores will not reopen their in-house cafes or restaurants. The British Retail Consortium's guidance is that customers should be discouraged from handling products that they're not going to buy. But the policy very much varies from retailer to retailer. At Selfridges, shoppers can try on shoes and the footwear will be sanitised afterwards. Kurt Geiger will also allow people to try on shoes - provided they use anti-bacterial hand gel first as well as a pop sock - but then the footwear will be placed in quarantine for 12 hours. But at H&M, people will not be allowed to try on footwear at all. It is the same for clothing. At Next, for example, customers can handle clothes but at Selfridges, shoppers will be asked not to touch items unless they intend to buy them. If they do, the garment will be quarantined for 72 hours. This is based on government guidance that the risk of infection from coronavirus on a surface is likely to be ""reduced significantly"" after a three-day period. The majority of retailers will close their changing rooms and goods returned will be quarantined for 72 hours. Some shops will also offer contactless returns. At Primark, customers will present the item they want to return to a staff member at a till, complete with their receipt which will be scanned. People will receive their refund and take their item to a returns section where it will be held for 72 hours before going back on the shop floor. At Waterstone's, that three-day rule will also apply to books that customers browse through in store, which will allow them to ""self-heal"", according to chief executive James Daunt. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people will not be allowed to handle makeup or sniff a perfume bottle. But picking things up in a shop might be a hard habit to break for some, says consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale. ""There will be this almost automatic behaviour of your muscles where you want to touch something,"" she says. ""But then you're in the middle of the flow of your hand to the counter [and] you will remind yourself, 'No, I can't.'"" And this can create other problems. Conventional wisdom suggests everyone will be delighted to get out of the house and treat themselves to a day's shopping from Monday. Not quite, says Ms Nightingale. Restrictions in shops, such as not touching items or being told which direction to walk in is likely to frustrate people already experiencing anxiety since lockdown was enforced on 23 March. ""We are basically living in a constant state of fear and anxiety - don't leave the house, don't touch anyone, don't do exactly what you were doing before - this is not a normal way of human behaviour,"" says Ms Nightingale. That means people will be going back to shops after more than three months ""with a pre-existing huge ball of negativity in our head, whether we want it or not"". Even the smallest things can cause grumpiness. At HMV, which has already reopened stores in Canada and the US, shoppers are asked to sanitise their hands before handling any merchandise. ""There are confrontations in stores about it,"" Doug Putman, the owner of HMV, told the BBC. ""For some customers, they are very comfortable, for [others], they are a little less comfortable. And I think it just comes down to your personality type."" On the whole, though, he expects people will do their bit. ""What you've got is an overall public sentiment that even if you don't believe that you should have to sanitise and this and that, you're going to do it because it is the right thing."" Much like supermarkets, retailers will ask shoppers to queue to prevent overcrowding in stores and allow people to maintain 2m social distancing. To relieve the tedium, some department store Selfridges will employ DJs to help make it a more ""joyful experience"". It may also take longer to pay for your shopping as some retailers will close every other cashier to prevent people being in close proximity to each other. People may also have to wait for their favourite shop to even open in the first place. While retailers like Primark will open 153 stores in England on Monday, John Lewis is initially only reopening two sites, at Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames. It intends to reopen 11 more stores the following week. Stores are being chosen on the proviso they are easily accessible by car, ""therefore reducing the reliance on public transport for partners and customers""."
39,Coronavirus bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours?,"The first ""support bubbles"" of people who can meet indoors has been announced in England and Northern Ireland.","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 11:51:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52637354,"As lockdown restrictions are eased further, people in England and Northern Ireland can now set up support bubbles. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. From Saturday, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size. Nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. The independent advisory group Sage has been asked to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubbles. The idea was introduced in New Zealand and is being considered by the Scottish government. Support bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They won't have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can even stay overnight. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. There is no limit on how far you can travel in England for your support bubble but local is best, the government says. You can't bubble with anyone in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, if you are single and live alone in Northern Ireland you can bubble with another household. Social and family groups are complicated and might not fit bubble rules. Grandparents: Single parents: If you are single: You can read the government's guidelines in full here. If you don't live on your own, or you are not a single parent whose children are under 18, then the rules haven't changed. However, you can, of course, invite someone eligible to join a social bubble with your household. Otherwise, you must meet people you don't live with outside. The number of people you are allowed to meet depends on where in the UK you live. Basically, when people mix - especially in crowded places - coronavirus can spread. The virus is transmitted by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. That's why people have been asked to maintain social distancing when meeting anyone not from their household. Bubbles allow some people more contact with others, while keeping other social distancing measures in place. Who will be in your social bubble?

40,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,Loss of taste and smell have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 19:53:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,"The NHS has listed three main symptoms of coronavirus, that people should be aware of and ready to act upon. If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus. Follow James on Twitter.

41,Coronavirus: What is a recession?,The world faces the worst recession for 80 years. But what does that mean?,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:14:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52986863,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls. A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. If a recession carries on for a long time, or is particularly bad, it is known as a depression. For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls. This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession. In the UK, the economy shrank by 2% from January to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. It then shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - in its first full month in lockdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK. In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts. The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer. It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid. The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be. If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back. So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come. A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery. But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend. But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further. Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come."
42,Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England?,People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced.,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 10:50:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754,"People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. The NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. An app is also being developed, although its launch has been delayed. The hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead. Anyone in England with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No-one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Manual tracing was meant to be launched in mid-May, in tandem with an app that would automatically alert users if they have been in contact with another user with coronavirus. The manual element launched in England on 28 May.  The app is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight and hasn't been released more widely, although business minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested it would be in place by the end of June. At the government's briefing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to be ""confident people are following the advice given by human beings"" before the app was introduced. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, and has recruited 2,000 contact tracers. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop the danger of the virus spreading. You should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine and live alone, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. If you live with other people they won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England's tracing system would be ""world-beating"". On launch, the government claimed the tracers could track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day. There were 8,117 people testing positive referred to the scheme in its first week, but just 5,407 of those provided details of recent contacts. Those people provided 31,794 contacts, 26,985 of whom were reached and agreed to self-isolate. The government says some people who tested positive couldn't be reached either because their contact details were unavailable or incorrect or they didn't respond to attempts to get in touch. When recent contacts were given, in some cases those details were incorrect,  or contacts either did not respond or refused to self-isolate. Over three-quarters of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate within 24 hours. Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading England's track and trace system, said: ""We clearly have more to do make sure we reach everyone and more to do to speed up the end to end service."" The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. It's currently voluntary, but the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply ""we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house"". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is £95.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions."
43,"Coronavirus: When will pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants reopen?","Pubs and restaurants in England are expected to reopen in July, but can I meet a friend for a meal?","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 10:07:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52977388,"Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in England may soon be able to reopen their doors for the first time since lockdown began in March. But despite the easing of restrictions, a trip to a local bar or dining establishment could be a very different experience from how it was before coronavirus. In its recovery strategy document published on 11 May, the government said that the hospitality sector - which includes pubs, bars and restaurants - could start to reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"", if Covid-19 safety guidelines could be met. The government has yet to announce details of what these guidelines would be, but they're expected to include rules on social distancing, heightened hygiene procedures and protection of bar and restaurant staff. It will provide ""further safer working guidance"" for restaurants, pubs and bars ""as soon as we can"", Business Secretary Alok Sharma said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. On 20 March, all pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes were asked to shut in order to stop the spread of coronavirus The only exceptions to this were cafes and canteens at a few selected places such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Since then, many restaurants have started offering food delivery and takeaways in order to generate income while their doors are closed. Some pubs have also been allowed to offer takeaway beers. Each nation of the UK is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: The chief worry for many people in the hospitality industry is the issue of social distancing. Some have insisted that the current 2m distancing rule makes it impossible for bars, cafes and restaurants to make a profit. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the industry body UK Hospitality, says that with a 2m rule, outlets would be only able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would increase that to 60-75%. Some Conservative MPs have added their support for reducing social distancing, and the prime minister said on 10 June that the 2m rule was ""under constant review"". The Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca says it is considering a range of measures to keep staff and workers safe amid the pandemic. Customers are likely to be given the option of ordering food on apps, while staff will be encouraged to wash their hands every 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the Wetherspoons pub chain has said its staff will be provided with face masks and protective eyewear and it will run a reduced food menu. Bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise will be replaced by individual sachets. Customers will also be encouraged to sit outside in pub gardens, while some indoor seating areas will be separated by Perspex screens. The hospitality sector was the third-largest employer in the country in 2018, according to UK Hospitality. But many restaurants and cafes were already struggling even before the Covid-19 outbreak, in the face of rising rents and falling consumer spending. Since lockdown began, job cuts and closures have been announced by chains such as Frankie & Benny's and Carluccio's.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs £130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant Thousands of workers in the industry have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, which allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500. Many other countries have already reopened restaurants, bars and cafes around the world. In some cases they have had the use of lower social distancing recommendations - in France, for example, the recommended distance between customer and staff is 1m."
44,All you need to know about new measures,How will social and work life be different after the easing of some restrictions around the UK?,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:10:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518,"Lockdown measures are being eased further after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England from Saturday, households containing one person, or one adult and children, can form a ''support bubble'' with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. People can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. In Scotland, eight people from two different households can now meet up outdoors if they maintain social distancing. It is recommended that eight is the maximum group size and that people do not meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors. Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although up to 10 people can now attend outdoor weddings and civil partnerships. In all four nations, permitted numbers of people includes children, and social distancing - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others - should be followed unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble.  The rules are different for people who are shielding. The overall advice remains ""stay at home"" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis are all allowed in England. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should still not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. Wales and Scotland do not want households to travel more than five miles if possible, but 11 Conservative MPs have questioned the Wales decision. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed that hotels and tourist accommodation can reopen on 20 July. Most people entering the UK - including British citizens - now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so ""for the foreseeable future"". People who must travel to their workplace are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive if possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport, on which they are likely to face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Read the government advice in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now spend some time outdoors again. Those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can now go outdoors. In Scotland, ""adjustments"" are anticipated in the coming weeks to the shielding guidelines. House moves and viewings have resumed again in England. Potential buyers and renters are able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. However, the government's plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term is now being dropped. Instead, schools will be given ""flexibility"" over whether or not to admit more pupils. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. From 15 June in England, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their ""continued remote, home learning"". However, at the Downing Street briefing on Monday 8 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are ""Covid-secure"". Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Zoos, safari parks, drive-in cinemas and other outdoor attractions are expected to be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June - as long as they follow social distancing rules. Places of worship will also be allowed to reopen for private prayer shortly although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later"", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

45,Coronavirus pandemic: Tracking the global outbreak,Key maps and charts explaining how the respiratory virus has spread around the world and how it is being dealt with.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 13:11:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105,"Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world, with eight million confirmed cases in 188 countries. More than 430,000 people have lost their lives. This series of maps and charts tracks the global outbreak of the virus. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.

US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. The US has by far the largest number of cases - now more than two million and about 25% of the global total - according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by Brazil and the UK. In China, the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data Figures last updated: 16 June 2020, 16:37 BST The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and says people should be prepared for new outbreaks, especially in areas where lockdowns are eased.  Globally, at least 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - were living under social distancing measures at the height of the pandemic in Europe, according to the AFP news agency's estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger. While some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise. A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the WHO to say the Americas were the new centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These charts show four countries - Brazil, Mexico, India and Pakistan - where deaths have been on an upward trajectory - as shown by the red lines. Peru, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador and Brazil are among the Latin America countries which have seen widespread outbreaks. Chile has extended its state of catastrophe orders by a further 90 days, to allow the government to continue to enforce quarantine restrictions, while Peru has announced its economy shrunk by 40% in April when compared with April last year. The health crisis continues in Brazil, which has by far the largest population in Latin America. The country now has the second highest official death toll in the world and is recording an average of about 1,000 deaths per day. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the risks of the virus and prioritised the economy in his decision-making, even criticising state governors for introducing regional quarantine measures. Elsewhere, India and Pakistan have both seen the number of infections and deaths rise in recent weeks and the healthcare systems in both countries appear to be under strain. Authorities in the southern Indian city of Chennai are to reimpose a lockdown on Friday after a surge in cases. In Iran there are fears of a second wave of infections. New cases averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous week. China is also dealing with dozens of new cases believed to be connected a Beijing wholesale market, and has imposed lockdown measures on several neighbourhoods. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent so this could be distorting understanding of how far the virus has spread. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. The UK has reported more than 41,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Europe. Italy has the second highest death toll with about 34,000, while both France and Spain are just below 30,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated. Having been on lockdown to control the spread of the virus, European countries are now beginning to ease restrictions. How and when restrictions are lifted varies from country to country, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a ""slow, steady"" approach. The risk of a second wave of infections requiring European countries to re-impose full lockdowns is moderate to high, according to the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases. With more than two million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded more than 115,000 deaths. The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 30,000 deaths in total, but the number of daily deaths has remained below 100 since late May - down from 1,000 a day in early April. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but most states have now loosened their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. Nationally, the number of new cases has remained steady at around 20,000 a day for several weeks, but the situation is not the same in every state. In recent days the governors of Oregon and Utah halted plans to ease lockdown restrictions, citing local spikes in infections. More than 44 million people - more than a quarter of the country's workforce - have applied for jobless benefits since the pandemic hit. The economic downturn in the US has now been officially declared a recession."
46,Coronavirus: Five unanswered questions on the travel quarantine rules,Travellers to the UK now have to self-isolate for 14 days. But how will the rules work in practice?,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 12:05:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52963306,"Most people entering the UK from overseas are now expected to self-isolate for 14 days. But there are still questions about how quarantine will be enforced and why it has been implemented now. Under the new rules, most travellers entering the UK by land, air or sea must complete an online form in the 48 hours before they arrive, stating where they will be staying in the UK while self-isolating and how they can be contacted. They could be fined £100 for not filling in the form, while there is a fine of up to £1,000 in England for those who are found to be not complying with the self-isolation rules. However, when filling in this ""contact locator"" form, travellers are given the option to not put down an address at all, or to put down more than one. The Home Office says that if someone arrives without a place to stay, then they will have to book accommodation at their own expense at a list of hotels provided, using its bookings system. One reason people can put down more than one address is in case they need to stay in a hotel before moving on to their ultimate destination, or are legally obliged to change addresses, it adds, for example due to a court order. Guidance for border officials, seen by the BBC, indicates that unless the port of entry is particularly quiet, it is likely only ""spot checks"" will be used to see if passengers have filled out the forms. The guidance states that border staff will generally have no way of checking whether addresses are real. They are advised to accept the information given unless other factors suggest there are ""credibility concerns"" - for example ""stating that their name is Mickey Mouse or that their address is Buckingham Palace"". Public Health England (PHE) says it will contact 20% of those required to self-isolate via a phone call and text message. If they have reason to suspect that somebody isn't complying, then their details can ultimately be passed to police who will enforce the measures as a last resort. However, the Home Office says police do not have a right to enter someone's home on the basis of this offence. What's more, there are several reasons why someone is permitted to not be at an address, for example if they need to buy essential supplies and have no-one to do this for them. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the decision to bring in a travel quarantine system now is ""guided by science"", as UK transmission (or the spread of the virus) is low enough for imported cases to potentially cause a ""devastating second wave"". Prof John Aston, the Home Office's chief scientific adviser, says the ""scientific advice so far is clear"" that the impact of the policy would have been ""negligible"" while transmission rates were higher. ""As the number of infections within the UK drops, we must now manage the risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere,"" he says. However, some have questioned the decision to bring in quarantine measures now, when the UK has a higher transmission rate than many other countries. Conservative MP Sir Liam Fox said in the House of Commons last week: ''If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak, and if it is a contingency measure against a so-called second wave, why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have?"" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, suggests bringing in the policy ""would have had some effect"" during the ""containment phase"" of the virus response back in February. But he argues that bringing it in now ""won't have any measurable impact on public health whatsoever"". In late February and early March, the government did advise passengers from affected areas, such as Wuhan in China and parts of Italy, to self-isolate when arriving in the UK, but this policy was dropped on 13 March. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said at the government's coronavirus press conference that ""measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and applied to countries with higher rates"". There was some confusion over whether these travel quarantine rules would apply to the whole of the UK, because border security is a centralised measure, while health is devolved - meaning England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own rules. Ultimately the measure was brought in as part of the Public Health Act, so when the UK government decided to introduce quarantine rules on 3 June they were for England only. All home nations have now made it a requirement for travellers from abroad to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the UK. But they could choose to end the policy at different times, or to vary the rules. For example, workers providing essential healthcare will have to quarantine upon arrival in Scotland but not in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The level of fines issued for breaking the rules also vary. In Scotland, if someone fails to self-isolate for 14 days at a fixed address they will be fined £480, while in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it's £1,000. In England, an individual will be fined £100 for not filling out the contact locator form correctly. In the rest of the UK the fine is £60, falling to £30 if paid promptly. There has been a lot of discussion about so-called ""air bridges"", which could allow visitors from countries with low coronavirus transmission rates to enter the UK without having to self-isolate. For an air bridge to open, two countries would have to agree to relax quarantine restrictions. So far, Portugal is the only country offering to open an air bridge to the UK. Sources close to the government have told the BBC that the Department for Transport is keen to open air bridges by the end of the month. ""Quash the quarantine"", a lobbying group of more than 500 travel and hospitality companies, says it has been given ""private assurances"" from senior government sources that travel corridors - which encompass land, air and sea borders - will be in place by that time.

47,When can I ride an e-scooter legally?,"With people told to avoid public transport, the government's hoping to trial e-scooter rental schemes.","Wed, 10 Jun 2020 08:40:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48106617,"With people told to avoid public transport, the government's hoping to trial e-scooter rental schemes - possibly by the end of June. But what are e-scooters and where can they be used? They're two-wheeled scooters with small, electric motors. Their popularity has grown and scooter-sharing schemes now operate in more than 100 cities around the world - including San Francisco, Paris and Copenhagen. People can hire e-scooters, often using smartphone apps, in a way similar to city centre bicycle hire schemes. Electric scooters are freely available to buy in the UK online and in stores, and they cost anywhere from just over £100 to more than £1000. Currently, you can buy one but you can't ride it on a UK public road, cycle lane or pavement. Anyone who does is committing an offence. The only place an e-scooter can be used is on private land, with the permission of the landowner. At the moment, they are classified as Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs), so they're treated as motor vehicles and are subject to all the same legal requirements - MOT, tax, licensing and specific construction. So, because they don't always have visible rear red lights, number plates or signalling ability, they can't be used legally on the roads. The law covering e-bikes - which are battery-assisted pedal cycles - doesn't currently cover e-scooters, but the government wants to regulate them in a similar way in future. Normal scooters, those without motors, are not allowed on pavements or cycle paths - but they can be used on roads. The Department for Transport wants e-scooters rental schemes - similar to those seen in European cities - tried out across England, Wales and Scotland. Riders wouldn't need to take out their own insurance to hire an e-scooter, but they would need a driving licence or at least provisional one. The hired vehicles could be used - legally - within set geographical boundaries. But it would still be illegal to use a privately-owned e-scooter on a public road, even if you were in a trial area. The government says it will monitor safety and keep the year-long scheme - part of a £2 billion plan to invest in greener travel - under review. We don't know at the moment. As well as bringing forward the start date to the end of June, the government has - in light of the coronavirus crisis - widened the scope of the scheme across the whole of Great Britain. Initially, four ""future transport zones"" were chosen for the trials - the West Midlands; Portsmouth and Southampton; the West of England Combined Authority (Bristol, Bath and surrounding areas); and Derby and Nottingham. The Department for Transport says: ""A high number of areas across Great Britain have expressed an interest in running e-scooter trials."" If you were to use a hired e-scooter outside of any of the trial areas - yes, you could be fined. Likewise, if you use a privately-owned e-scooter on any public road, cycle lane or pavement. You could get a £300 fixed-penalty notice and, if you have one, six points on your driving licence. Electric scooters can exceed 30mph (48.3km/h), although many are limited to 15.5mph (24.9km/h). Television presenter Emily Hartridge is believed to be the first person to die in an accident involving an electric scooter in the UK. There are no official tallies on global deaths and injuries, but there have been a number of studies: Some e-scooters have only a single brake, which makes stopping safely more difficult. There are strong advocates for the introduction of electric scooters in the UK.

48,Coronavirus: What tests are being done in the UK?,"What are the tests for coronavirus, who are they for and how do they work?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 16:20:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51943612,"Testing will be vital to controlling coronavirus outbreaks as lockdown eases. The government says tests are now available to anyone with symptoms, and it aims to process tests within 24 hours by the end of June. In England and Wales you can apply for a swab test for yourself, or for anyone in your household, if you or they have symptoms In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff. Couriers collect samples and take them to laboratories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June, except where there were difficulties with the post. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of the Test and Trace service, has previously said 84% of drive-in centre tests come back within a day. No figure has been provided for home kits. Speed is important because delays give the virus more time to spread. Scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, the stage of infection someone's at when tested, or problems in the lab. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, has called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Testing is essential if contact-tracing systems now in place across the UK are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. And in theory it can help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. But representatives of hospital trusts and care home providers say staff need to be tested regularly, not as a one-off, to ensure this. Testing can also let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On 7 June, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes, some of which may never be returned. It also includes tests carried out as part of a surveillance study by the Office for National Statistics, which don't serve the purpose of diagnosing individuals. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test didn't work. A government spokesperson said it was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to ""increase transparency"". There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

49,Can thermal cameras help spot coronavirus?,"The devices allow a person's temperature to be checked from a distance, but are not always reliable.","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:48:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52940951,"As lockdowns ease, thermal imaging cameras are popping up in all sorts of public places to assess the state of people's health. Using infrared technology, thermal cameras detect radiating heat from a body - usually from the forehead - and then estimate core body temperature. These cameras are an extremely powerful tool, often deployed by fire fighters to track smouldering embers and police to search for out-of-sight suspects. But they are not designed to be medical devices. So how useful are they in the current pandemic? They can give a reasonable measure of skin temperature, to within half a degree - but that's not the same as body temperature. ""These devices, in general, are less accurate than medical device thermometers like those you stick in the ear,"" says Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science from University College London. About 37C (98.6F). A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or over. But normal temperature can vary from person to person and change during the day. It can also fluctuate during a woman's monthly cycle. Taking an accurate reading of core body temperature isn't easy. Although it can be measured on the forehead, in the mouth, the ear and the armpit, the most accurate way is to take a rectal reading.  37°C(98.6°F) normal body temperature 38°C(100.4°F) or above, high temperature/fever No, they only measure temperature. A high temperature or fever is just one common symptom of the virus. Others include nausea, headaches, fatigue and loss of taste or smell. But not everyone with the virus gets a high temperature and not everyone with a high temperature is infected with coronavirus. So thermal cameras alone will miss infected people with other symptoms or no symptoms at all - known as false negatives. They will also identify people unwell with a fever for another reason - known as false positives. On its own, temperature screening ""may not be very effective"" says the World Health Organization. Cameras have to be set up correctly and take account of ambient temperature. A risk is that cameras can lull operators into a false sense of security. ""They are… only one tool among many,"" says James Ferryman, professor of computational vision, from the University of Reading. ""Heat radiating from the skin will likely be impacted by wearing face masks,"" says Prof Ferryman. That's why most temperature measurements are based on the forehead, which is usually exposed. Not necessarily. Skin temperature actually goes down during exercise as sweat appears on the surface of the skin. The body is pretty good at regulating its temperature even after exercise, so it would have to be really quite high to show up. With portable thermometers pointed at foreheads. They don't need to touch the skin, but do need to be within a few centimetres of it. While accurate to a fraction of a degree on skin temperature, they correctly detect fever about 90% of the time compared with a rectal thermometer, Prof Hill says. Thermal scanners are now in place at some UK airports - including Bournemouth. Temperature screening is being trialled for some passengers at Heathrow, while Manchester Airport says equipment is also being tested - but results will not be communicated to passengers or ""used to influence whether a customer can travel"". Portsmouth international ferry port has also installed a thermal scanner to screen departing passengers. Schools are deploying hand-held laser thermometers to check children each morning. And some employers are looking at introducing staff-testing in workplaces. Under UK employment law, individuals must agree before an employer can temperature-screen members of staff. Some work contracts will already allow for this type of test to be carried out, by so-called ""implied consent"". If employees do not consent - and there is no pre-agreed policy covering the situation - then taking someone's temperature is unlawful, says the professional body for HR and people development. Employers must also handle the medical information they gather fairly and transparently - according to the Information Commissioner. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
50,Coronavirus: What's the chance of going on holiday?,"Is it now possible to go on holiday, either in the UK or abroad?","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:10:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52646738,"The chance of having a summer holiday seems remote - with many UK tourism businesses still shut and foreign travel difficult because of quarantine rules. What is the latest situation? No - not until the start of July at the earliest. Lockdown restrictions are being eased slowly across the UK, but the tourist industry does not yet have the green light to reopen fully. You'll probably be able to get an ice cream at the seaside - and some restaurants and bars are doing takeaway food and drink - but hotels remain closed to all guests, except for a small number of specific groups. Government advice in England says businesses providing holiday accommodation - including hotels, campsites, caravan parks and short-term lets - should stay closed for leisure-related trips. No person should stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose, it adds. The Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he's keen get the tourism sector going as ""rapidly as possible"" with the government sticking to what it describes as an ""ambitious target"" to get England's tourism sector back by 4 July - ""as long as it is safe to do so"". ""Self-contained accommodation has a lower risk than other areas,"" Mr Dowden told the Commons, ""I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue."" Hotels in Northern Ireland already have a confirmed date for reopening - Monday 20 July. Zoos and animal parks are shut, as are many national parks. Facilities such as car parks and toilets may not be open either. People are also being urged not to rush to beauty spots such as the Lake District. Visit Cornwall says that people should not travel to the area unless they can return home within 90 minutes. In addition, people who live in England cannot travel for recreation into Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. At the moment, it's difficult. British nationals are still being urged not to take any non-essential foreign travel. This means you are unlikely to get travel insurance, because insurers take their cue from the official advice. But the airlines are hopeful for the summer season. EasyJet plans to resume some flights this month, while Ryanair and British Airways plan to ramp up their services in July, On 15 June the European Union lifted travel restrictions, leaving it to individual counties to decide if they're ready for tourists. Some, including France, Germany, Italy and Portugal are now welcoming travellers from the UK. Others, including Ireland and the Netherlands will force visitors to quarantine for 14 days upon entry. Greece is open, but tourists will have to be tested for coronavirus upon arrival. Anybody testing positive will have to quarantine for 14 days. British holidaymakers are currently unable to enter Australia, India and the US. They will also have to spend two weeks quarantined in a hotel upon arrival if they wish to visit New Zealand. Most travellers will also have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return to the UK. UK aviation bosses are hoping a large number of so called ""air bridges"" will be in place by 29 June, when the UK travel quarantine measures are set to be reviewed. These would exempt travellers from quarantine, if they move between countries with low virus levels. Again, it's impossible to say at this stage. Travel advice will need to have been updated, but it depends on the disease's progress. If your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled, then you are are entitled to a full cash refund. However, lots of people have been struggling to get their money back, and have been offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead. If you are offered a voucher, or a free rebooking instead of cash, you can accept or refuse it. But if the airline later folds, the voucher may no longer be valid. If your airline or holiday company hasn't cancelled your holiday yet, but you no longer wish to travel, you may not be entitled to a refund. However, some providers are allowing people to rebook trips for a later date at no cost. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity.

51,Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask,Our guide to different types of face coverings and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 16:22:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52609777,"People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.

52,Coronavirus: Are protests legal amid lockdown?,Black Lives Matter protests continue in the UK - but are they illegal under restrictions on gatherings?,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 11:27:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52909814,"Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with this rave in the West Midlands last month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at £100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets."
53,Coronavirus: What are the rules on weddings?,There is a lot of uncertainty around when and how weddings are allowed to take place. What are your rights?,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:20:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509,"About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated £10bn to the economy. Ceremonies this year have been devastated by coronavirus, but Northern Ireland will allow small outdoors weddings from Monday. There is no official word yet about the rest of the UK. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to take place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland has allowed weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have been granted emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment"", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act"", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to £30,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."
54,Coronavirus: Why are international comparisons difficult?,Should you be comparing Covid-19 statistics between countries?,"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:30:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52311014,"Everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling coronavirus, compared with others. But you have to make sure you're comparing the same things. The United States, for example, has far more Covid-19 deaths than any other country - as of 18 May, a total of more than 90,000 deaths. But the US has a population of 330 million people. If you take the five largest countries in Western Europe - the UK, Germany, France, Italy and Spain - their combined population is roughly 320 million. And the total number of registered coronavirus deaths from those five countries, as of 18 May, was more than 130,000 - nearly 50% higher than that of the US. The number of deaths is rising faster in the US, but individual statistics don't tell the full story. For comparisons to be useful, says Rowland Kao, professor of data science at the University of Edinburgh, there are two broad issues to consider. ""Does the underlying data mean the same thing? And does it make sense to compare two sets of numbers if the epidemiology [all the other factors surrounding the spread of the disease] is different?"" On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on 10 May, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University said that trying to rank different countries to decide which was the worst in Europe was a ""completely fatuous exercise"". But he referred to ""the bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy"" and said ""clearly it's important to note that group is way above, in terms of their mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark Norway, who have low fatality rates."" So why is it so difficult to compare individual countries? First of all, there are differences in how countries record Covid-19 deaths. France and Germany, for example, have been including deaths in care homes in the headline numbers they produce every day. But the daily figures for England referred only to deaths in hospitals until 29 April, when they started factoring in deaths in care homes as well. A further complication is that there is no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. Does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics, or are the suspicions of a doctor enough? Germany counts deaths in care homes only if people have tested positive for the virus. Belgium, on the other hand, includes any death in which a doctor suspects coronavirus was involved. The UK's daily figures only count deaths when somebody has tested positive for the virus, but its weekly figures include suspected cases. Also, does the virus need to be the main cause of death, or does any mention on a death certificate count? Are you really comparing like with like? There is a lot of focus on death rates, but there are different ways of measuring them too. One is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of all the people who test positive for coronavirus, how many go on to die? But different countries are testing in different ways. Early in the outbreak, the UK mainly tested people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital. That can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country with a wider testing programme. The more testing a country carries out, the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms, or perhaps no symptoms at all. So, the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate. Another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a country's population - the numbers of deaths per million people, for example. But that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached. If a country's first case was early in the global outbreak, then it has had longer for its death toll to grow. The UK government compares how each country has done since recording its 50th death, but even that poses some problems. A country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and reduce the eventual death toll. When studying these comparisons, it is also worth remembering that most people who get infected with coronavirus will recover. It is more difficult to have confidence in data which comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems. Is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like China or Iran accurate? We don't really know. Calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population, China's figures are extraordinarily low, even after it revised upwards the death toll in Wuhan by 50%. So, can we really trust the data? There are real differences in the populations in different countries. Demographics are particularly important - that's things like average age, or where people live. Comparisons have been made between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but they are problematic. Ireland has a much lower population density, and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas. It makes more sense to compare Dublin City and County with an urban area in the UK of about the same size (like Merseyside) than to try to compare the two countries as a whole. Similarly, a better though still imperfect comparison for London, Europe's major global city, may be with New York, the biggest global hub in the United States. You also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure. A comparison of death rates between countries in Europe and Africa wouldn't necessarily work, because countries in Africa tend to have much younger populations. We know that older people are much more likely to die of Covid-19. On the other hand, most European countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most African countries. And that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus, as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing. Health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic, but they are not all the same. ""Do people actively seek treatment, how easy is it to get to hospitals, do you have to pay to be treated well? All of these things vary from place to place,"" says Prof Andy Tatem, of the University of Southampton. Another big factor is the level of comorbidity - this means the number of other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure - which people may already have when they get infected. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far. Both Germany and South Korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries. The number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates. But not all testing data is the same - some countries record the number of people tested, while others record the total number of tests carried out (many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result). The timing of testing, and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community, also need to be taken into account. Germany and South Korea tested aggressively very early on, and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading. But Italy, which has also done a lot of tests, has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths.  Italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold. The UK is doing the same thing. So, is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons? ""What you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another, and what you can learn from that,"" says Prof Jason Oke from the University of Oxford. ""And testing seems to be the most obvious example so far."" But until this outbreak is over it won't be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better. ""That's when we can really learn the lessons for next time,"" says Prof Oke. This piece was first published on 21 April and has been updated to reflect the latest statistics.

55,Can superspreading be stopped?,"Identifying superspreading events could be crucial in the fight against the virus, scientists say.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:16:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52903787,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people. This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid."" Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies. How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including: But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events. ""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says. ""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission."" Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases."" But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms. All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time. But Dr Knight says there is another common thread. ""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky. ""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example."" Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection. ""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors. ""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible. ""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk."" Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says. Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus. But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed, Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge."" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

57,Coronavirus: How dangerous is lifting lockdown?,"Why is lifting restrictions being described as a ""dangerous moment""?","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 23:57:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52878816,"Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a ""dangerous moment"" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. ""It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,"" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at ""Level 4"" rather than ""Level 3"" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is ""not a lot of room"" for manoeuvre and the data ""urges caution"". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those ""following the science"". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. ""Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,"" argued Prof Calum Semple. There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a ""second wave"". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. ""With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,"" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: ""I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. ""It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.""

58,Coronavirus: Why we don't know how many are being tested,The UK Statistics Authority has criticised the government's handling of Covid-19 testing data.,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 16:47:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52891611,"The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are ""far from complete and comprehensible"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had ""temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting"". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. ""People tested"" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with ""void"" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one ""person tested"" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a ""small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test"", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was ""just not happening"". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as ""smoke and mirrors"". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to ""show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the ""people tested"" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the ""people tested"" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as ""people tested"" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed ""to avoid confusion"". Follow Rachel on Twitter"
59,Social distancing: A practical guide to how to socialise now,Meeting friends? Here's how to handle the awkward new rules - from sharing food to avoiding hugs.,"Sat, 30 May 2020 08:43:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52848793,"The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone ""we're all going to wash our hands once an hour"". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says ""wash your hands"". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."
60,George Floyd death: 'The same happened to my son',An immigrant community divided by the anti-racist protests rocking the US.,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 23:33:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53023703,"Youa Vang Lee was at her home in Minneapolis when her son showed her the video of George Floyd dying under a police officer's knee. Lee, a 59-year-old Laotian immigrant who assembles medical supplies at a factory, heard Floyd cry out for his mother. It triggered a deep and familiar pain. ""Fong was probably feeling the same way, too,"" she said in Hmong, her eyes filling with tears. ""He was probably asking for me, too."" In 2006, Lee's 19-year-old son Fong - who was born in a refugee camp in Thailand - was shot eight times by Minneapolis police officer Jason Andersen. The officer remains on the force to this day, a fact that the Lees were not aware of until told by the BBC. The officer was terminated twice, but has apparently since been rehired. Although security footage showed Lee was running away at the time, Andersen claimed the teenager had a gun. A grand jury declined to indict him and the police department ruled the shooting justified. The family sued in civil court claiming excessive force and brought evidence the gun found beside Fong's body was planted. An all-white jury found against them. Youa hadn't spoken publicly about her son in over a decade, not since the family came to the end of their legal road with nothing to show for it. But after Lee saw Floyd's death, she began asking if anyone knew of marches she could attend. ""I have to be there,"" she said. Although no one directly discouraged her, some members of her community questioned the decision. The Twin Cities, as Minneapolis and St Paul are known, are home to the largest urban population of Hmong in the US, many of whom came to the area as refugees in the 1980s and 90s. The Hmong are an ethnic group from South-East Asia, with their own language, mainly drawn from southern China, Vietnam and Laos. Within that community, there has been heated debate about how to respond to the Black Lives Matter and Justice for George Floyd movements, which are demanding systemic change to policing. For Youa Lee, however, there was no debate. She wanted to get involved for one reason - when Fong died in 2006, the first people to show up in support of her family came from the black activist community. ""They were the loudest voices for us,"" recalled Shoua Lee, Fong's older sister. ""Even before we asked for help from other communities, they had come to us and offered their help."" Although four officers have been charged with the murder of George Floyd on 25 May, the viral video of the incident only captures two of them - former officer Derek Chauvin, who kneeled on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, and former officer Tou Thao, who kept the crowd back, rather than going to Floyd's aid. ""Don't do drugs, guys,"" Thao said at one point to distressed onlookers. Thao, an 11-year veteran of the department, has been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. He is also Hmong. As soon as Boonmee Yang, a fourth-grade public school teacher in St Paul, saw the video, he knew things were going to get complicated in the Hmong community. ""Oftentimes, it's always been black victims at the hands of white officers. But now that someone else who looked like me was also involved in this, it made me really concerned,"" he said. As a Hmong activist, Yang said that it hasn't always been easy to publicly express solidarity with the black community. He said some suffer what he calls ""sheltered Asian syndrome"", meaning they rarely interact with others from outside the Hmong community, and that their knee jerk response was to defend Thao's actions. There is also a history of conflict between the two communities, particularly in the early days of resettlement, according to hip-hop artist and activist Tou SaiKo Lee. Refugee families often wound up in the Frogtown neighbourhood of St Paul and in East St Paul, areas that have historically had large African American populations. ""There was conflict between youth. Fights between new immigrants, new refugees and those that are currently living in the neighborhood - I was a part of that,"" he recalled. ""There's some that still hold that tension."" Unlike the more broadly defined ""Asian American"" demographic, the Hmong community has a much shorter history in the US. Almost half of the Laotian Hmong fled their country in 1975, after the fall of Saigon in the Vietnam War. For 15 years, the CIA recruited thousands of Hmong soldiers to fight a so-called ""secret war"" against the North Vietnamese, but after the US pulled out without providing an evacuation plan for their allies, those who cooperated with the Americans, or were perceived to have, fled. Some were killed by the communists, thousands wound up in Thai refugee camps. Tens of thousands were resettled in Minnesota, an overwhelmingly white state with few resources for the new immigrant population. Without the ability to speak the language, many could not find work. Today, the Hmong population in the US actually has much in common with the African-American population in terms of socioeconomic and other quality of life factors. According to figures from the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center, one in four Hmong Americans lives below the poverty line. While 50% of the broader category ""Asian Americans"" have graduated university, only 17% of Hmong Americans have a college degree. And while 72% of white families own a home, less than half of Hmong Americans and African Americans do. The Hmong community has also long struggled with interactions with police. Initially, there was no Hmong representation among its ranks. Officers struggled to understand and to serve the new population. In an infamous 1989 case, a police officer shot two sixth-grade Hmong boys in the back as they ran away from a stolen car. The officer was never charged. Tou SaiKo said he was often racially profiled by Minneapolis police as a teenager, at one point spending two nights in jail after an officer found a fishing knife in his trunk. He said he was never charged, but he remembered getting pulled over many times and asked ""What gang do you affiliate with?"" ""I'd say, 'I'm a college student,'"" he recalled. Still, those common struggles between the black and Hmong communities did not prevent old tensions from leaping to the fore in the aftermath of Floyd's death, particularly as looting and property damage hit Asian-owned businesses in the Midway neighbourhood of St Paul. ""Tou Thao"" is a very common Hmong name, and many who share it with the indicted officer faced online threats and harassment. And as young Hmong activists - in particular women and members of the LGBTQ community - attempted to express support of Black Lives Matter, they faced condemnation and vitriol from within their own community, even threats. Annie Moua, a recent high school graduate, saw plenty of comments online within her Asian American political groups that she calls ""anti-black"", saying things like ""all lives matter"" and asking, ""They never helped us during our protest - why do we need to help them?"" ""During that week I lost a lot of friends,"" she said. It was during the worst of that online fighting that Yang got a Facebook invite from a friend to join a group called ""Hmong 4 Black Lives."" There were only three members at the time. ""I was on it,"" he said. He saw that a large Black Lives Matter demonstration was planned at the Minnesota State Capitol the next day, and created an event page for the nascent group. By morning, there were 300 members of Hmong 4 Black Lives (as of this writing there are now over 2,000). By afternoon the next day, a group of about 100 Hmong activists had gathered at the capitol, carrying signs that read, ""I'm a Thao and I stand with Black Lives Matter"" and ""I am Hmong and for BLM - period"". For 18-year-old Moua, it was her very first protest, and after the amount of turmoil she'd witnessed online, she was scared. ""I was very, very nervous,"" she said. ""I did not know what was going to go down."" Among the marchers was a small, elegant woman in a face mask and a baseball cap - Fong Lee's mother, Youa. After fleeing their farm in Laos, and four years of waiting in a refugee camp in Thailand, Youa and her husband dreamed of giving their children a brighter future in the US. America was supposed to be a refuge. She never dreamed her middle son would wind up dead at the hands of a police officer. ""I feel like it was a mistake to bring my children here,"" she said in Hmong, translated by her daughter Shoua. ""Now my son is gone."" Fong Lee was 19 years old when he went for a bike ride on 22 July, 2006. He was with a group of his friends in the parking lot of Cityview Elementary, a school in North Minneapolis, when officer Jason Andersen and a state trooper pulled up in a squad car. The boys took off running, with Andersen following Fong. A security camera from the school captured the final moments of the chase - Fong runs from the parking lot around the corner of the school, and Andersen is seen close behind with his gun pointed at Fong. Though blurry, the security footage does not clearly show a gun in Fong's hands, a fact that Andersen acknowledged at trial. In the final frame, Fong is seen lying on his back, bloodied and unmoving. He was hit four times in the back. Almost as soon as the news broke, Al Flowers, a longtime Minneapolis activist who has sued the police department multiple times over charges of brutality, started showing up to protests - at the school, at the courthouse. The Lees always saw him and another activist, the late Darryl Robinson of Communities United Against Police Brutality. They didn't ask to show up, Shoua Lee said, they just showed up. For his part, Flowers said that after years of fighting for justice in the killings of black men and women, he believed that because Fong was Asian, there was a greater possibility that the officer would be convicted. ""We felt like he was treated like we was always treated,"" Flowers recalled. ""[We thought] he's going to get justice. And then he didn't. So we were shocked."" Mike Padden, the Lee's family attorney in the civil case, said losing the case even with surveillance camera footage and the strange history of the gun recovered at the scene has always troubled him. ""In 2009, the environment for suing cops was way different than it is now,"" he said. ""It bothers me. It was probably the most disappointing case in my career."" An old, Russian-made Baikal .380-caliber semi-automatic handgun was found about three feet from Fong's left hand, free of fingerprints or blood. In 2004, a man reported his gun stolen in a burglary. He was later told by Minneapolis police that his gun had been recovered in a snowbank and it would be in police custody until an investigation had concluded. The gun matched the serial number on the Baikal .380 caliber found by Fong Lee's body. When that was pointed out at trial by Padden, the police provided an explanation -- the gun found in the snowbank was not the Baikal .380. There had been a mix-up with the identification and the paperwork, and the Baikal had never been in their custody. The Minneapolis Police Department did not respond to questions from the BBC about the case. Andersen was back on the street two days after Fong's death. The Minneapolis police chief later awarded him the department's ""medal of valour"" for his actions that day. The Minneapolis Police Department tried to fire Andersen twice after that - once after he was arrested for domestic violence, and once after he was indicted by federal investigators for kicking a teenager in the head during an arrest. The domestic violence case was dropped due to lack of evidence, and a jury acquitted Andersen in the assault on the teenager, despite the fact that other officers had reported his actions that day as excessive. Minneapolis' powerful police union helped get Andersen rehired. The union is often cited as the reason why it is so difficult to fire officers with problematic records. In the aftermath of George Floyd's killing, the city of Minneapolis is trying to take on the union by withdrawing from negotiations. Andersen is still an employee of the Minneapolis Police Department, and serves as the chaplain coordinator. Social media posts show him handing out donations, like car seats, bed sets and kitchen supplies to needy families in Minneapolis. In a brief phone call with the BBC, Andersen confirmed that he is the same officer from the Lee shooting and referred all questions to the department's media spokesperson. ""It's something that's been put in the past and I know that was very, very hard for them because they lost their son,"" he said of the Lees. ""I care for the family a lot and they went through something traumatic. ""Both of us had to live through this so when this gets dug back up, it's probably - it's something they never want to hear about again."" It was Tou SaiKo Lee who asked Youa if she'd like to come to the state capitol, march with Hmong 4 Black Lives and speak about her son. It'd been almost 10 years, and Tou was also worried that bringing the case back up might be too traumatic. But her answer was instantly, yes. That day, as they walked towards the capitol steps to join the larger Black Lives Matter group, Youa was in front, walking silently as the younger Hmong participants chanted around her. At some point, someone handed her the microphone. Even though she couldn't do it in English, she spoke passionately about supporting George Floyd's family and the movement that was born in his name. She promised to do anything she could for the Floyd family. ""We have to join hands with them,"" she told the crowd. ""We come here to beg for justice and righteousness."" She wept openly, bringing many gathered around to tears as well, even those who could not understand her. ""Without Fong Lee's family it would just be Hmong people bickering back and forth,"" said Tou SaiKo. ""Many people see their own mother in Fong Lee's mother, many Hmong people, and so to see her in that emotional state, with those empowering words calling for solidarity, I thought that was a breath of fresh air."" When told that Fong's mother had joined the George Floyd protests, Flowers was pleased. ""I'm proud that she's out there supporting,"" he said. ""My memory is watching her have to go through that and not understanding the law, not understanding what was really happening in the United States - that this could happen. ""We as African Americans, we knew what was the possibility and we knew that could happen. That was sad because we lost another case. That was another case we lost."" And although not everyone in the crowd for the first ever Hmong 4 Black Lives march could understand her, according to Annie Moua, the person who took the microphone immediately after Youa summed it up perfectly. ""You don't need to understand [Hmong] to know what this pain feels like."""
61,"A key model used by the White House is now projecting more than 200,000 deaths by October as 18 states show a spike in coronavirus cases","Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the administration's coronavirus task force, is publicly painting a rosy picture of the pandemic through his words and actions amid President Donald Trump's push to reopen the country and resume campaigning.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:54:43 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/s8gfGtAUEdk/index.html,"Vice President Mike Pence, the leader of the administration's coronavirus task force, is publicly painting a rosy picture of the pandemic through his words and actions amid President Donald Trump's push to reopen the country and resume campaigning. But despite the administration's efforts to declare the pandemic over, 18 states are currently experiencing an increase in cases. And health officials have implored Americans to heed task force guidelines -- including wearing a mask and social distancing -- to slow the spread, and a key model used by the White House is now projecting more than 200,000 deaths by October. ""We may be done with the pandemic, but the pandemic is not done with us,"" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said during a STAT Conversation on Tuesday. ""It makes sense why so many Americans are feeling like we're done, and they're feeling a certain sense of apathy,"" he said. Jha said it boils down to three things. ""First, is that they were told that if we shut down and really kind of bend the curve, that we will we will be passed the worst and everything will work out,"" he said. Secondly, early data and models ""seemed to imply that all of a sudden the virus would go away in June, July and August."" But that's not likely. And third, Jha said Americans are over it because of ""communication from our president, who has clearly has moved on."" ""The reality is that the virus is with us. The reality is that the first wave only hit a small number of places -- now it's coming to every other place. It's coming to a county or a city or a state near you,"" Jha said. Pence makes the case On Monday, Pence urged governors to take increased testing into account for increased cases. And on Tuesday, he penned an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal claiming there is ""no second wave"" of coronavirus. Pence also traveled to Iowa Tuesday, where he had lunch at a local restaurant with Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds and made remarks at Winnebago Industries touting US ""recovery."" At the restaurant, neither Pence nor Reynolds nor the restaurant's owner or patrons wore a mask, and he did not practice social distancing as he greeted diners. Pence also openly flouted social distancing guidelines last week with a trip to Trump campaign headquarters, posting a since-deleted photo with a large group of tightly clustered campaign staff, none of whom wore masks. Pence attributed a rise in US coronavirus cases to an increase in testing during a Monday call with the nation's governors. But those comments came in the context of an extensive conversation between Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Dr. Deborah Birx on rising cases that weren't attributed to increased testing. ""I would just encourage you all, as we talk about these things, make sure to explain to your citizens the magnitude of increase in testing and in that, in most of the cases where we are seeing some marginal rising number, that's more a result of the extraordinary work you're doing, expanding testing using that public-private partnership that the President forged months ago,"" Pence told the governors, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. Increasing the numbers of tests is likely to find more cases. Another key figure is the rate of positive tests -- if it's high or growing, it indicates a community isn't doing enough of the testing needed to identify and isolate cases, which is what can slow an outbreak. While a state's overall case numbers or positivity rates may appear steady or improving, more specific data is required for particular communities to understand where outbreaks are occurring and at risk of growing. Pence also said on the call that there are specific areas where there has been ""some increase in cases that are not necessarily accounted for entirely by an increase in testing,"" pointing to areas in North Carolina, California and Arizona, where, he said, the CDC has redeployed additional personnel. An official familiar with the work of the task force was more blunt and told CNN that the surge in cases is also due to more infections. ""They just don't want to deal with the reality of it,"" the official said of Trump, Pence and other top officials. ""They're in denial."" And a senior US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told CNN that Pence is selectively choosing data to make his point. ""I don't know what his source is on that information, but that's not accurate,"" the senior CDC official said of Pence's assertion that only a small percentage of places in the US are seeing an uptick in cases. ""You can cherry-pick a handful of counties and use that as way to say things are not as bad as they look. But that's not the reality."" The senior CDC official added, ""Our data shows that there continues to be spread, particularly in communities of color. It's both higher rates and disproportionate numbers. By state, the numbers are absolutely increasing and they're increasing in states that opened up earlier."" Azar pointed to concerns about increased trends in positive testing in certain areas. ""We have been concerned about looking at data showing in many states, increasing trends of cases, but increasing trends of positive testing ... that causes us to take a very deep dive at the data at a county level, and it reveals that we do have issues going on at particular counties in states,"" Azar said. ""My message just would be as governors, you can't just be looking at your state level data to feel that you're in a good position, you've gotta actually get down to the county level because that's where you're going to see if you're facing an actual outbreak scenario that might be meatpacking, nursing homes, and might be of other origin,"" he added. Birx did explain that because of an increase in testing, more cases, including asymptomatic and presymptomatic cases, are being found in the community, rather than in hospitals. ""So, I don't ever get discouraged that the case numbers are going up when you're test positivity rate is going down. Really an extraordinary job you're doing and I think you should be commended for that. We do have isolated counties, and I'm just gonna mention a couple of them,"" she said. Birx said that North Carolina's Wake County and Mecklenburg County, where the Republican National Convention was scheduled to be held later this summer, were experiencing increased positivity. 'Such panic is overblown' And in the Wall Street Journal, Pence blamed the media for inciting ""panic"" regarding a second wave of coronavirus. ""In recent days, the media has taken to sounding the alarm bells over a 'second wave' of coronavirus infections. Such panic is overblown. Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and the courage and compassion of the American people, our public health system is far stronger than it was four months ago, and we are winning the fight against the invisible enemy,"" Pence wrote, citing expanding testing, supply production and medical research. Hundreds of Americans continue to die from coronavirus each day, and many public health experts, including the administration's own experts, are predicting a second wave. The latest coronavirus forecast by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington takes into account seasonality predictions. The institute's model has been frequently cited by the White House. Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation director Dr. Christopher Murray said ""seasonality will be a very big driver of the second wave, we believe,"" during a briefing last week outlining a death toll model that has since been increased. ""The increase in daily deaths really starts to gather more momentum from mid-September, onwards,"" Murray said. And Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, warned of the importance of the flu vaccine in the context of a second wave earlier this month, telling a House Appropriations Committee hearing: ""If a second wave of coronavirus hits when flu season is under way, it could really strain hospitals."" Pence touts roughly 500,000 tests performed each day, and 23 million tests total, in the op-ed, though that is far short of what experts say is needed. He also claimed that the US is ""well on our way to having a viable vaccine by the fall,"" though Dr. Anthony Fauci has suggested that timeline is too soon. During an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer last week, Fauci expressed confidence that a trial will have accrued a large number of subjects and there will be an answer on whether it works ""by the end of the year."" But, he cautioned: ""There is never a guarantee that a vaccine -- and we have multiple candidates, it isn't just one -- that is going to be safe and effective."" After crucial weeks when the President downplayed coronavirus earlier this year and actively lied to Americans about its potential impact, losing time as the virus spread to the US, the administration hamstrung key efforts by the CDC to mount a coordinated response to the pandemic. Yet Pence on Tuesday blamed the media, which has sought to provide information from those experts to the American people, for fear-mongering. ""The media has tried to scare the American people every step of the way, and these grim predictions of a second wave are no different,"" Pence wrote. It points to an administration that is taking political considerations ahead of public health. Trump and Pence are set to hold a packed rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, later this week, where social distancing will be unlikely and face masks will be optional. ""It really is time, Ainsley, for us to begin this campaign. The President wants to be out, he wants to be connecting to our supporters. Literally over a million people have signed up to try and obtain the opportunity to come and attend the rally,"" Pence said during an appearance on Fox News Tuesday. ""The freedom of speech, the right to peacefully assemble is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution and the President and I are very confident that we're going to be able to restart these rallies to tell the story of what the president has done thorough these unprecedented times but also over the last three and a half years,"" he continued. The administration official close to the task force said it has not been asked to give their blessing to the campaign rally. ""They know better,"" the official said. This story has been updated with additional reporting Tuesday evening. CNN's Jim Acosta, Nick Valencia, Maggie Fox and Jamie Gumbrecht contributed to this report."
62,Pence falsely claims Covid-19 cases in Oklahoma are falling,"During a White House roundtable Monday, Vice President Mike Pence claimed that Oklahoma - where President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally Saturday -  has seen a decline in the number of coronavirus cases.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:31:34 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-pFP3PyMhT8/index.html,"Washington During a White House roundtable Monday, Vice President Mike Pence claimed that Oklahoma - where President Donald Trump is scheduled to hold a campaign rally Saturday -  has seen a decline in the number of coronavirus cases.  ""In a very real sense they've flattened the curve,"" Pence said of Oklahoma. ""The number of cases in Oklahoma has declined precipitously.""  Facts First: Oklahoma's number of newly reported positive cases has been increasing since late May, not steeply declining.  A record 225 new cases were reported in Oklahoma on Saturday. On Sunday that number declined to 158 new cases and went back up to 186 on Monday according to Oklahoma's State Department of Health. In its latest weekly report, the OSDH says that over the past two weeks Oklahoma has begun experiencing ""an increase in the number of cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19"" and the ""threat of COVID still exists and we anticipate it to grow."" OSDH reported a 12.9% increase in the number of new cases during June 5-11 compared to the previous week, which saw an 8% increase from the week before.  Tulsa-- where Trump is set to give his first 2020 rally since March 2 -- also saw a record high of 89 new cases Sunday, according to the Tulsa Health Department. And the city's 7-day rolling average of new cases has been steadily increasing since May 31.  Tulsa Health Department's director Bruce Dart told the local newspaper, Tulsa World, on Saturday that the city is undergoing a ""significant increase in our case trends"" and warned of Trump holding the scheduled rally. ""COVID is here in Tulsa, it is transmitting very efficiently,"" Dart told the paper. ""I wish we could postpone this to a time when the virus isn't as large a concern as it is today.""  With 1,222 total confirmed cases, Tulsa currently ranks second to Oklahoma City, which has 1,331 cases, for the city with the highest number of coronavirus cases in the state.  When reached for comment, Pence's office pointed us to an interview Monday between Tulsa World and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. In the interview, Stitt said ""there are less than 1,000 active cases right now"" and argued that ""we are in really, really good shape from a health care perspective in the state of Oklahoma"" noting that 150 people are currently hospitalized in the state for the virus.  But Oklahoma has seen an increase in new cases over the past two weeks -- along with the highest recorded cases in a single day -- when the number of tests given decreased. Regardless of the number of active cases, new cases have been steadily rising in the state.  As of Monday, Oklahoma has had a total of 8,645 coronavirus cases, with 6,765 recovered from the virus and a total of 363 deaths. CNN's Daniel Dale contributed to this article."
63,Lawyers sue to stop Trump's Tulsa campaign rally over virus fears,A group of Tulsa lawyers have filed a lawsuit to stop President Donald Trump from hosting a campaign rally in the Oklahoma city on Saturday unless the organizers agree to take steps to adhere to his administration's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of coronavirus.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:33:42 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Ll4xqPWt5Ao/index.html,"A group of Tulsa lawyers have filed a lawsuit to stop President Donald Trump from hosting a campaign rally in the Oklahoma city on Saturday unless the organizers agree to take steps to adhere to his administration's own social distancing recommendations to limit the spread of coronavirus. In addition to the lawsuit, the attorneys are requesting a hearing to ask for an emergency temporary injunction to prevent the rally from happening while the lawsuit moves forward. Visit CNN's Election Center for full coverage of the 2020 race Citing Tulsa health department statistics showing that the highest new coronavirus case count occurred this Monday, the lawyers are suing the parent company of the Bank of Oklahoma Center, the venue slated to host the rally, alleging ""despite this alarming uptick in COVID-19 infections in Tulsa County, ASM Global plans to bring tens of thousands of people into an enclosed arena in downtown Tulsa for a political rally on June 20, 2020 ... without putting precautions in place to prevent the spread of the virus."" ""As currently planned, the Rally will endanger not only the health of the guests in attendance, but the entire Tulsa community and any community to which the guests may afterward travel. If ASM Global moves forward with the Rally without adequate review, planning, training, protective equipment, and safeguards, cases of COVID-19—and the unavoidable attendant deaths—will rise,"" the petition states. The rally would be Trump's first major campaign event since the coronavirus pandemic shut down most of American life, and officials are expecting hundreds of thousands of supporters to attempt to attend. The Bank of Oklahoma Center holds about 20,000 people but the Trump campaign has claimed that more than 1 million individuals have made an online RSVP to attend, though it's dubious how many actually plan on doing so. The Trump campaign declined to comment on the lawsuit. Paul DeMuro, one of the attorneys representing the plaintiffs, told CNN that the decision to sue to stop the rally was not political. ""We're not asking to stop the rally. So you need to understand that, first, if Joe Biden, if the Thunder (the NBA team in nearby Oklahoma City), if Garth Brooks was wanting to have a 19,000-person event and this center on Sunday, without abiding by the government mandated CDC guidelines, with respect to mass events, we'd be making the same allegations and filing the same lawsuit,"" DeMuro said. ""All we're asking, it's very simple: If the President wants to hold a rally here, he needs to abide by the social distancing guidelines of his own (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)."" Trump campaign officials have said that there will be temperature checks upon entry to the arena, and masks and hand sanitizer will be distributed. However, there are no plans to implement social distancing guidelines. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a series of community groups and two specific individuals, who the attorneys describe as particularly vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19. In their complaint, they describe the indoor event as a ""super spreader"" that could end up impacting even people who choose not to attend. They point to the CDC-recommended guidelines in their complaint as evidence that the proposed event could cause a great danger to the public. Lara Trump, a senior Trump campaign adviser and daughter-in-law to the President, said in an interview with Fox News on Monday that the campaign will not ""enforce that everybody wear a mask"" at the rally. ""We are offering people masks,"" Lara Trump said. ""If they choose to wear them, we are happy with that. If they choose not to wear them, we are not going to go around and enforce that everybody wear a mask."" View 2020 presidential election polling While DeMuro says the lawsuit isn't political, the groups also appear to be sending another message as well. The lawsuit notes Tulsa's past, including the Tulsa race massacre of 1921, one of the most violent racist events in American history in which a white mob killed hundreds of African Americans and destroyed the Greenwood neighborhood, also known as Black Wall Street. After the campaign announced the rally would be held in Tulsa on Juneteenth, the holiday commemorating the emancipation of slaves after the end of the Civil War, Trump faced intense political pressure and made a rare reversal by moving the rally to Saturday. The plaintiffs in the case include the Greenwood Centre, a group entrusted with the ownership and management of buildings in the historic neighborhood, and the John Hope Franklin Center for Reconciliation, which is described as a group that ""organizes and hosts events in downtown Tulsa dedicated to bringing awareness to issues of racial discrimination and keeping alive the memory of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre."" Local and campaign officials have described the planning of this rally as chaotic. Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum, a Republican, wrote on Tuesday in a Facebook post that he did not know the ""invitation had been extended"" for Saturday's campaign rally. ""Was the nation's first large campaign rally after the arrival of COVID-19 my idea? No. I didn't even know the invitation had been extended until BOK Center management contacted the City regarding Police support for the event,"" Bynum wrote. ""Do I share anxiety about having a full house at the BOK Center? Of course. As someone who is cautious by nature, I don't like to be the first to try anything. I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already."" State and city officials told CNN they are expecting roughly 200,000 people to be in Tulsa for the rally. Since the BOK Center only holds 20,000, the huge amount of interest has lead to the exploration of additional venues for overflow or some sort of second event. A Trump campaign official told Tuesday CNN that they are exploring options for a second, overflow venue to accommodate the expected response to the rally. The campaign has yet to firm up those plans, but said that the main rally won't change. The second location would serve as an additional opportunity for supporters of the President to take part in the event and it is ""likely"" that the President will appear at that venue in person. A number of options are being considered for the second venue, including outdoor locations, but the goal is to find a second venue that is ""adjacent"" to the BOK Center. "
64,Some think looser restrictions could make second wave worse,"The United States could see more than 200,000 deaths from Covid-19 by October 1, a closely watched model predicted Monday as states continue to reopen.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:29:48 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/r66HpejiT2I/index.html,"A mix of early reopenings and disregard for personal safety measures have prompted researchers to increase their projections of Covid-19 deaths this summer. One model cited by the White House now predicts 200,000 US deaths from coronavirus by October 1 -- an increase of 30,000 deaths since last week's projection by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. That would mean an average daily death toll of more than 840 Americans since February 6, the date of the first known US death linked to Covid-19. ""Increased mobility and premature relaxation of social distancing led to more infections, and we see it in Florida, Arizona, and other states,"" said Ali Mokdad, one of the creators of the model. ""This means more projected deaths."" But IHME projections have been low in the past, and others say the death toll could be higher. ""Sadly, I think this 200,000 number may be a under prediction based on what we're starting to see in several states across the country,"" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said. More than 2 million Americans have been infected by the virus, and more than 116,125 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. How states are trending 18 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: California, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Wyoming, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina, Alaska and Hawaii.10 states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Washington, Utah, South Dakota, Kansas, Iowa, Tennessee, Ohio, West Virginia, Maine and Rhode Island.  22 states are seeing a downward trend: Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Nebraska, North Dakota, Minnesota, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware. Why doctors are worried ""What we're seeing from footage -- especially from the states where we see these cases rising -- is that states are not opening gently. They're opening with lots of crowds,"" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of the infectious diseases division at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""They're opening with a lack of face masks ... And when that happens, you don't need too many infections for cases to soar."" That's because without social distancing this coronavirus can be twice a contagious as the flu. It's easy to infect others even without symptoms. And it has a lengthy incubation time, meaning those who eventually get sick can be contagious for days without knowing it. Yes, testing is up. But so are hospitalizations Some governors have attributed their rise in Covid-19 cases to increased testing. It's true that testing has improved, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. But ""when you start seeing more hospitalizations, that's a surefire sign that you're in a situation where you're going in the wrong direction,"" Fauci said. On Monday, Texas reported a new record high of 2,326 hospitalizations due to coronavirus. And in the past week, at least 12 states saw higher rates of Covid-19 hospitalizations. Some places reconsider plans to reopen Texas' capital city, Austin, has extended stay-at-home orders through August 15, Mayor Steve Adler announced Monday, citing a spike in new coronavirus cases. North Carolina's next steps are not yet clear. Gov. Roy Cooper told reporters Monday that he would announce early next week whether the state will still under phase three of the state's reopening later this month. The rates of new cases in New Jersey are trending downward, but Gov. Phil Murphy said he wants the state to proceed cautiously. ""We're not just going to throw up our doors all at once as other states have done,"" Murphy said. ""We've already paid a huge, huge almost unfathomable price."" Arkansas, on the other hand, still plans to move into phase two of its reopening despite recording its largest daily spike in new cases on Friday -- 731 new cases. ""I hope we don't repeat"" that, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. But ""we can't have life on hold for six months to a year until there's a vaccination ... We have to be able to carry on life and business."" Scientists are learning more about the virus Even though this coronavirus has killed more than 430,000 people worldwide, it's still relatively new. The National Institutes of Health launched a database to collect medical information on US coronavirus patients to learn more about the virus. ""This effort aims to transform clinical information into knowledge urgently needed to study COVID-19, including health risk factors that indicate better or worse outcomes of the disease and identify potentially effective treatments,"" the NIH said. The Red Cross announced it will start testing all blood, plasma and platelet donations for coronavirus antibodies to help educate donors about whether they've already been exposed to the virus. Why it's still safe to donate and receive donated blood The test, which has been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration, shows whether a person's immune system has produced antibodies to fight the virus. And a condition called Multi-Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) could be a delayed response to a coronavirus infection, according to a team at the New York health system Northwell Health. ""We were pretty shocked as it was playing out,"" Dr. Charles Schleien said. ""The whole syndrome came out of the blue. We had been comfortable for months (in the belief) that kids weren't affected all these months by coronavirus.""

65,Analysis: Why will no one in the White House wear a mask?,"In the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon, President Donald Trump announced an executive order designed to make police more accountable to the communities they serve. He did so without a mask on. And by the look of a video the White House sent out on Twitter shortly afterward, almost no one in attendance wore a mask either.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 22:26:05 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Xu8WOXYtejQ/index.html,"In the Rose Garden on Tuesday afternoon, President Donald Trump announced an executive order designed to make police more accountable to the communities they serve. He did so without a mask on. And by the look of a video the White House sent out on Twitter shortly afterward, almost no one in attendance wore a mask either. In Iowa on Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence stopped at a diner named ""Sally's Restaurant"" to greet people. He did not wear a mask. Later, Pence toured a Winnebago factory -- again without wearing a mask. (Pence also published an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal insisting that we are not on the verge of a second wave of the coronavirus). In Washington, DC, Monday night, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney were spotted having dinner on the outdoor patio of a restaurant near the White House. Neither man wore a mask. Those three moments come against this backdrop: Coronavirus cases are increasing in 18 states, and a new projection by one respected model suggests that a total of more than 200,000 Americans could be dead from Covid-19 by October 1. They also come less than 24 hours after Trump asserted bizarrely that ""if we stop testing right now, we'd have very few cases, if any."" And less than 12 hours after The New York Times first reported that Pence, on a call with governors, had insisted, contrary to established facts, that they should tell constituents that the reason for the increase in coronavirus cases was due to an increase in testing across the country. And all of this is happening just five days from Trump's planned return to the campaign trail in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- at an indoor arena that fits 19,000 people and where mask wearing is not mandatory. It's a remarkable disconnect. On the one hand, Trump, his allies and his supporters seem absolutely intent on behaving as though coronavirus is something of the past, something that the United States -- thanks to this President -- has crushed. ""I just want to say we've done incredibly well,"" Trump said in his remarks Tuesday afternoon. ""We're doing well. Things are happening that nobody can even believe. Our country is opening up. And it's opening up rapidly."" On the other, virtually every doctor, medical professional and infectious disease expert has said that mask wearing is the single best defense against a second surge of the virus as the county begins to reopen. In a study released by the National Academy of Sciences earlier this month, the authors concluded this: ""Our analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic. This protective measure significantly reduces the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the United States, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public."" And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been recommending mask-wearing when outside since last month. Here's the guidance: ""In addition, CDC also recommends that everyone wear cloth face coverings when leaving their homes, regardless of whether they have fever or symptoms of COVID-19. This is because of evidence that people with COVID-19 can spread the disease, even when they don't have any symptoms."" In addition to the very clear medical guidance from experts and his own administration, there's the fact that Trump, as president, is looked to by many Americans for guidance as to how the ongoing fight against coronavirus should be handled. When the President, the vice president and practically everyone around them doesn't wear masks (even when 6 feet of social distance is clearly impossible to maintain) the message is clear: Masks aren't necessary. When the President makes clear, as Trump has done time and time again, that he chooses not to wear a mask because he doesn't like how it looks, that makes the message all the more powerful. And when he mocks former Vice President Joe Biden for wearing a mask, well, I mean if anyone misses that Trump message -- masks are unnecessary and for wimps -- then you may need to make sure your spinal cord is still connected to your brain stem. What's so depressing about all of this is that mask wearing (or not) doesn't have to be political. In fact, it shouldn't be political. This isn't about partisanship. This is about public health. And whether you're worried about getting the coronavirus isn't the point! You wear a mask to protect other people! Especially those who are older or have pre-existing medical conditions -- since we know Covid-19 is far more dangerous to them. Winning the fight against the coronavirus requires that we all understand we're in this together. What Trump and Pence are doing is seeking to divide us. "
66,CDC report offers detailed demographic breakdown of who is getting coronavirus,New numbers released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer a comprehensive picture of who in the United States has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and how they fared.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:13:33 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/vFipcW3iFbI/index.html,"New numbers released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer a comprehensive picture of who in the United States has been diagnosed with Covid-19 and how they fared. The latest figures confirm that older people, minorities and those with preexisting health conditions are at the highest risk of death. There was a total of 1,761,503 cases of Covid-19 and 103,700 related deaths in the country between January 22 (when the first case was confirmed) and May 30, according to the surveillance report, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. The data come from local, state and federal sources and is consistent with those reported through the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center. Overall, 184,673 (14%) patients were hospitalized, 29,837 (2%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 71,116 (5%) died. Hospitalizations are six times higher and deaths are 12 times higher among those who reported underlying conditions. The most common underlying conditions were cardiovascular disease (32%), diabetes (30%) and chronic lung disease (18%). INTERACTIVE: Tracking Covid-19 cases in the US The report found that the incidence rate is 403.6 cases per 100,000, with men and women getting sick at almost the same rate. But the percentages of males who were hospitalized (16%), admitted to the ICU (3%) and who died (6%) were higher than were those for females (12%, 2% and 5%, respectively). The rate was highest among people 80 and older and lowest among children 9 and younger. But the relationship between age and incidence rate was not a straight line: It was higher among peoples age 40-49 years and 50-59 years than among those age 60-69 years and 70-79 years. Among cases with known race and ethnicity, 33% were Hispanic, 22% were black, and 1.3% were American Indian or Alaska Native. The report notes that ""these findings suggest that persons in these groups, who account for 18%, 13%, and 0.7% of the U.S. population, respectively, are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic."" The seven-day moving average number of new daily cases peaked at almost 32,000 on April 12 and deaths peaked 2,856 on April 21. While the seven-day moving average numbers of new cases and deaths are declining, the report notes that there is still ongoing community transmission. According to the report, ""the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be severe, particularly in certain population groups. These preliminary findings underscore the need to build on current efforts to collect and analyze case data, especially among those with underlying health conditions."" The report comes on the heels of a week that saw the national case count cross 2 million. Cases have increased in 18 states over the past week, with six states reporting more than a 50% jump. This has led some government and health officials to hit pause on reopening efforts. Still, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and one of the most prominent members of the White House coronavirus task force, told British newspaper The Telegraph a return to normalcy could come within a year, but people need to tamp down their expectations for typical summer travel and activities. ""It's going to be really wait and see,"" Fauci told the newspaper in an article published Sunday. ""My feeling, looking at what's going on with the infection rate, I think it's more likely measured in months rather than weeks,"" he said referring to the timeline for rolling back restrictions. Notably, Fauci expressed optimism in his interview published Sunday that a vaccine, or several vaccines, could soon be successful. ""We have potential vaccines making significant progress. We have maybe four or five,"" he said. ""You can never guarantee success with a vaccine, that's foolish to do so, there's so many possibilities of things going wrong,"" he explained. ""(But) everything we have seen from early results, it's conceivable we get two or three vaccines that are successful."" While scientists continue to work on a possible vaccine for the virus, top health officials are still encouraging social distancing, frequent hygiene practices and the use of face coverings to mitigate transmission.

68,Trump administration sues Bolton over book dispute,"• Read: Trump administration's lawsuit against Bolton over book
• Stelter explains why Trump and White House are 'clearly rattled' by Bolton's new book","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 01:12:26 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/purQa_YD0Es/index.html,"The Trump administration asked a federal judge on Tuesday to order former national security adviser John Bolton to stop the publication of his upcoming book on his White House tenure, arguing in a lawsuit that Bolton had breached non-disclosure agreements and was risking national security by exposing classified information. The suit, filed in Washington, DC, federal court, alleges that Bolton's 500-plus page manuscript was ""rife with classified information,"" and prosecutors say that Bolton backed out of an ongoing White House vetting process for the book that he'd been obligated to do as a result of the agreements. ""(Bolton) struck a bargain with the United States as a condition of his employment in one of the most sensitive and important national security positions in the United States Government and now wants to renege on that bargain by unilaterally deciding that the prepublication review process is complete and deciding for himself whether classified information should be made public,"" prosecutors write. Read the lawsuit The lawsuit marks the most significant escalation of a months-long battle between the White House and Bolton over the release of the book, which is billed as an insider's rebuke of President Donald Trump's foreign policy. The legal approach in the case is one of the more extreme attempts in recent years to stop a former Trump adviser from recounting his experience, and the administration's longshot attempt to stop the book's publication raises major First Amendment implications. Bolton's book has already shipped to warehouses ahead of its scheduled release. He has taped an interview with ABC slated to air Sunday. And a source close to him says he is intent on publishing the book as scheduled Tuesday, meaning he expects to deal with any ramifications from the administration in the aftermath, not before. Bolton's attorney, Chuck Cooper, told CNN they ""are reviewing the Government's complaint, and will respond in due course."" Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, said in a statement Tuesday that the lawsuit ""is nothing more than the latest in a long running series of efforts by the Administration to quash publication of a book it deems unflattering to the President."" ""Ambassador Bolton has worked in full cooperation with the NSC in its pre-publication review to address its concerns and Simon & Schuster fully supports his First Amendment right to tell the story of his time in the White House to the American public,"" the statement said. CNN has reached out to an attorney for Bolton for comment. In a letter sent to the NSC's legal adviser last week, Cooper accused the White House of seeking to block the book for ""purely political reasons,"" adding that ""as a practical matter, (it) comes too late."" An exhaustive back-and-forth between Bolton, his lawyer and the White House over the prepublication review process is detailed in the suit. Bolton, who left the White House in September, submitted his original draft late last year to the White House for the vetting process, and was told shortly after by a senior NSC official that it contained significant amounts of classified information, including material designated as top secret. After several in-person meetings and rounds of edits culminating in late April, Bolton appeared to have cleared the prepublication review. Ellen Knight, the official who reviewed the book, had determined that the latest version of the manuscript no longer contained classified information, the lawsuit says. But less than a week later, another round of reviews had begun in the White House, this time conducted by Michael Ellis, the NSC's senior director for intelligence. That review came at the request of Robert O'Brien, Bolton's successor as national security adviser, according to the lawsuit. O'Brien ""was concerned that the manuscript still appeared to contain classified information, in part because the same Administration that the Author served is still in office and that the manuscript described sensitive information about ongoing foreign policy issues,"" the lawsuit says. Ellis completed his review on June 9 and found that there were still instances of classified information in the book -- as news reports described Bolton's intention to move forward with the book's publication on June 23, even without White House approval. In a letter sent to Bolton's lawyer on Thursday, the NSC legal adviser wrote that ""the manuscript still contains classified information, because, among other things, it includes information that he himself classified and designated for declassification only after the lapse of twenty-five years."" Trump has been increasingly irritated by the notion that his former national security adviser will publish a tell-all book, multiple sources said. He told staff he wanted to halt its publication and mused privately about suing him to stop it, a tactic the President has relied on before when former officials or people close to him have written books he thinks will be unfavorable. He has a history of filing lawsuits he later drops. On Monday, Trump wrongly asserted that any conversations with him are classified and hinted at possible legal action. ""They're in court or they'll soon be in court,"" Trump said. ""But he understands he did not complete a process or anywhere near complete a process."" Trump said Bolton would have ""criminal problems"" if the book was published as is. The lawsuit filed Tuesday is a civil suit, and carries no criminal penalties. Initially, Attorney General William Barr did not confirm that his department was preparing a lawsuit but said the administration was focused on getting Bolton to complete the clearance process for publishing books. ""People who come to work in the government and have access to sensitive information generally sign an agreement that says when they leave government, if they write something that draws on or might reflect some of the information they've head access to, they have to go through a clearance process before they can publish the book,"" Barr said on Monday. ""We don't think Bolton has gone through that process, hasn't completed that process."" In addition to the delayed publication, the administration is asking the court to order Bolton's publisher to ""retrieve and dispose"" of any copies of the book that have already been disseminated. They also ask for any money the book earns from its sales -- or the sale of movie rights from it -- in the event that it is published without a completed prepublication review. In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union compared the suit to the Nixon administration's failed attempt to block newspapers' publication of the Pentagon Papers, which detailed a secret history of the Vietnam War. ""A half-century ago the Supreme Court rejected a similar attempt by the Nixon administration to block the publication of the Pentagon Papers, and since then it has been firmly established that prior restraints on publication are unconstitutional and un-American,"" the ACLU said. Early revelations from the book have already made waves in Washington. In January, as Congress debated articles of impeachment over Trump's dealings with the leader of Ukraine, leaked portions of the manuscript described how the President had directly tied a freeze of US military aid to the country with a request for Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political rivals in a conversation with Bolton. The account, which appeared in the New York Times attributed to multiple people's descriptions of the book draft, undermined a key pillar of the President's impeachment defense. At the time, Cooper, Bolton's attorney, claimed that the information had been improperly disclosed by people uninvolved with the then-ongoing review process. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday evening. CNN's Kylie Atwood and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report."

70,Pentagon warns China is exploiting Covid-19 to wage 'economic warfare' on the US,Defense officials are increasingly concerned China is using the coronavirus crisis to gain stakes in strategically important businesses as the pandemic leaves struggling companies urgently in need of capital.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:10:40 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/A-UKo4PkjWw/index.html,"Washington Defense officials are increasingly concerned China is using the coronavirus crisis to gain stakes in strategically important businesses as the pandemic leaves struggling companies urgently in need of capital. But even as the Defense Department works to improve supply security, procurement experts warn that the Pentagon may not have the visibility required to vet or help protect smaller companies down the chain. They say the job is only getting harder as the pandemic has broadened the definition of national security interests to include medical supplies. And they point to at least one Chinese-owned company that asked to bid on a Pentagon contract. ""We have to be very, very careful about the focused efforts some of our adversaries have to really undergo sort of economic warfare with us, which has been going on for some time,"" Ellen Lord, undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, told reporters in April. A defense official told CNN that ""we are paying close attention to any indicators that China is leveraging Covid-19 to take advantage of a situation where defense companies need capital more than ever."" New definitions of national security The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States protects against hostile countries gaining ownership in companies that are strategically important to the US. And a 2006 law banned US military use of Chinese-made military equipment, according to Bill Greenwalt, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former Pentagon official who specialized in procurement. But the pandemic is changing the definition of national security concerns to include drugs, protective gear and medical supplies. ""These are now national security needs and we probably should have been thinking about it a long time ago in terms of biowarfare that we should have a trusted industrial base or a set of trusted allies -- the UK, or NATO allies or Japan or Korea -- who are trusted in that regard,"" Greenwalt said. Chinese-owned firms dominate the market for protective gear and many drug components -- and they are already part of the Pentagon's medical supply chain. The Pentagon has awarded a contract for pandemic medical supplies to a company that then turned to a Chinese-owned subcontractor as one possible partner. The contract, part of an effort called Project Jumpstart, is meant to speed the public health response when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available. On May 12, the Pentagon and Health and Human Services Department issued a $138 million contract to ApiJect Systems America to coordinate the production of prefilled syringes in anticipation of a vaccine. ApiJect then reached out to a number of subcontractors, including Ritedose Corporation, a leading US-based company in the field that was purchased by the Chinese entity Humanwell Group in 2017. ""We understand that ApiJect, to move rapidly on achieving the goals of Project Jumpstart, is reaching out to those domestically based companies that can provide necessary [blow-fill-seal] capability -- and The Ritedose Corporation is pleased to be one of these companies,"" Ritedose CEO Jody Chastain told CNN. Essential devices Chastain said that, ""although we have not reached any arrangement or agreement with ApiJect, we certainly would be honored to do so and have our company as part of this effort against COVID-19."" Ritedose is described on the Humanwell website as the ""No. 1 in blow-fill-seal (BFS) unit-dose-sterile pharmaceutical manufacturing in the US, with annual capacity reaching 1.8 billion at its state-of-art, South Carolina-based facility."" Asked whether it reached out to Ritedose in connection with its DoD contract, ApiJect's director of media relations Steve Hofman told CNN that ""in our role in serving the public health in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have reached out to all domestic-based companies that have BFS capability essential to our role to create a domestic-based capacity to produce 100 million individual prefilled syringes as vaccines and therapeutics become available."" The Chinese embassy did not respond to CNN's requests for comment. Lt. Col. Mike Andrews said the Pentagon was aware that ApiJect is ""conducting discussions with potential subcontractors but have no reason to consider that ApiJect will not comply with the terms of its prime contract when making subcontract decisions. We will continue to work closely with ApiJect to help provide these essential injection devices to the American people."" Subcontractors compound the challenge of securing the Pentagon's supply chain, Greenwalt said, as contractors often ""don't have a good handle on what their third or fourth level suppliers are using in their equipment."" The Pentagon has been offering tools to help small US businesses defend themselves against adversarial investment, offering a webinar at the end of April for 300 companies on current regulations and tools to fend off unwanted bidders and investors. Much of the effort now grows out of a program that began last year called the Trusted Capital Marketplace. The Defense Department is partnering with vetted venture capital firms and conducting background checks with other government agencies to ensure transparency about where funds originate and who may be behind investments. It is particularly helpful for small companies and subcontractors that may make sensitive components but are finding it difficult to maintain needed capital during the virus crisis, the defense official said. President Donald Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro published a June 7 op-ed with Fox News saying China has exploited the pandemic to advance its strategic interests, prompting China's foreign ministry spokeswoman to ""advise Navarro to stop playing his old trick of blame-shifting because it will only lead to greater self-inflicted humiliation and further expose his nature as a habitual liar."" In Congress, concern has mostly focused on Chinese technology, where the risks include ""espionage and harmful effects if these things don't work,"" Greenwalt said, there is renewed focus on supply chain security for the active ingredients in drugs and protective gear. Lawmakers are now looking for ways to ensure the US is not dependent on China for either. Whether it's a missile guidance component or a vaccine, ""the next issue is if you want to surge in this area and you're dependent on a part from China and can't surge,"" Greenwalt said. Navarro recently told CNN that in the longer term, especially if Trump wins reelection, the US will likely treat offshore supply chains as national security priorities rather than as simply economic questions. ""If we fail to do that in the face of this crisis, we will have failed this country and all future generations of Americans,"" Navarro said. Trump himself has stressed China's supply chain dominance, saying May 29 that ""the pandemic has underscored the crucial importance of building up America's economic independence, reshoring our critical supply chains."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned US allies again last week to ""avoid economic overreliance on China"" and ""guard their critical infrastructure"" from the China's influence. 'This is how China operates' Pentagon officials are now also reaching out to other countries to discuss the risks. ""What I am concerned about is nefarious (merger and acquisition) practices,"" Lord told reporters. ""We have talked a lot with other nations, particularly in Europe, and we see a lot of shell companies coming in where the beneficial owner ends up being one of our adversaries.  I'm particularly concerned about that."" Dealing with China's economic pressure will require ""multilateral cooperation and work with likeminded democracies,"" said Martijn Rasser, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. He pointed to Europe as a concern, noting reports that China has threatened Germany and Denmark with economic consequences if they do not allow tech firm Huawei -- ostensibly a private company -- into their markets. Beijing recently slapped 80.5% tariffs on Australian barley exports after Canberra called for an investigation into the pandemic's origins. When China denied the move was retaliatory, saying that following a two-year inquiry it had confirmed that dumping by Australia had damaged its domestic industry, few took that at face value. Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, pointed to Australia's experience with its barley export and said, ""this is how China operates and everybody knows it."" Rasser said China could increase ""all these coercive tactics"" as economies struggle,"" adding that ""we don't want to be in the position where we can be coerced economically by China.""

71,CIA cyber weapons stolen in historic breach due to 'woefully lax security',"The largest theft of data in CIA history happened because a specialized unit within the agency was so focused on building cyber weapons that an employee took advantage of ""woefully lax"" security and gave secret hacking tools to WikiLeaks, according to an internal report released on Tuesday.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 22:01:39 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/kzBgDt4d1kA/index.html,"Washington The largest theft of data in CIA history happened because a specialized unit within the agency was so focused on building cyber weapons that an employee took advantage of ""woefully lax"" security and gave secret hacking tools to WikiLeaks, according to an internal report released on Tuesday. The hacking tools stolen in the breach, which occurred in 2016, came from its clandestine Center for Cyber Intelligence (CCI). The amount of data stolen is unknown, the memo said, but could be as much as 34 terabytes of data -- the equivalent of 2.2 billion pages of text. The theft was revealed around a year later, in March 2017, when WikiLeaks published what it claimed was the largest trove of CIA documents, dubbed ""Vault 7,"" detailing some of the agency's sophisticated cyber weapons, which was first reported by the Washington Post. That incident prompted a review by the CIA WikiLeaks Task Force, which submitted its findings in an October 2017 report to then-Director Mike Pompeo and his deputy -- who is now the director -- Gina Haspel. In a damning admission, its authors write: ""We failed to recognize or act in a coordinated fashion on warning signs that a person or persons with access to CIA classified information posed an unacceptable risk to national security."" While the CIA declined to comment on any specific report, agency spokesperson Timothy Barrett told CNN, ""CIA works to incorporate best-in-class technologies to keep ahead of and defend against ever-evolving threats."" The report released Tuesday is heavily redacted but clearly states that the breach came as a result of a series of security shortcomings ""over years that too often prioritized creativity and collaboration at the expense of security."" ""In a press to meet growing and critical mission needs, CCI had prioritized building cyber weapons at the expense of securing their own systems. Day-to-day security practices had become woefully lax,"" the report says. The task force memo was released Tuesday by Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon on the Senate Intelligence Committee, who obtained an incomplete, redacted version from the Justice Department. In a letter to the new Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, Wyden asked for more information about ""widespread cybersecurity problems across the intelligence community."" The CIA report released by Wyden emphasized the Agency didn't know the full extent of the damage because the CCI system - unlike other parts of the Agency's IT systems - ""did not require user activity monitoring or other safeguards..."" ""Most of our sensitive cyber weapons were not compartmented, users shared systems administrator-level passwords, there were no effective removable media controls, and historical data was available to users indefinitely,"" the report reads. ""Furthermore, CCI focused on building cyber weapons and neglected to also prepare mitigation packages if those tools were exposed,"" it adds. The material published by WikiLeaks in 2017 suggested that the CIA had become the globe's pre-eminent hacking operation, sneaking into high-tech phones and televisions to spy on people worldwide. Leaked information published by WikiLeaks as part of the ""Vault 7"" series contained notes about how the agency allegedly targeted individuals through malware and physical hacking on devices including phones, computers and TVs. To hide its operations, the CIA routinely adopted techniques that enabled its hackers to appear as if they were Russian, according to the documents published by WikiLeaks. US officials who previously spoke to CNN about the incident emphasized that any intelligence collection using the types of operations described in the documents is legal  against overseas targets. The officials also cautioned that some of the material describes programs still under development by the intelligence community. At the time, WikiLeaks claimed that nearly all of the CIA's arsenal of privacy-breaching cyberweapons had been stolen, and the tools are potentially in the hands of criminals and foreign spies. While the CIA task force responsible for the 2017 report made several recommendations to address these security failures, some lawmakers are still concerned that the intelligence community remains vulnerable to security breaches of this nature. ""The lax cybersecurity practices documented in the CIA's WikiLeaks Task Force report do not appear to be limited to just one part of the intelligence community,"" Wyden wrote, adding it called the breach a ""wake-up call"" that presented an ""opportunity to right longstanding imbalances and lapses."" ""Three years after that report was submitted, the intelligence community is still lagging behind and has failed to adopt even the most basic cybersecurity technologies in widespread use elsewhere in the federal government,"" he said. Wyden requested that Ratcliffe provide him unclassified answers to a series of questions related to the implementation of cybersecurity practices within the intelligence community by July 17, 2020. The CIA's lax cybersecurity practices were also highlighted in federal court earlier this year during the trial of Joshua Schulte, the ex-CIA employee who is accused of handing over reams of classified data to WikiLeaks in 2016. The October 2017 CIA report was introduced as evidence during the trial and Schulte's attorneys argued that the system's security was so poor that the information could have been accessed by a large number of employees. In March, a federal grand jury in New York failed to reach a verdict on whether Schulte did, in fact, give the data to WikiLeaks. Prosecutors have said that they intend to try Schulte again this year, according to the Washington Post. "
72,Defense secretary says official who questioned the legality of withholding Ukraine aid to resign,"The Pentagon official who raised concerns about the Ukraine aid being held in 2019 has submitted her resignation to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, the Pentagon announced Tuesday.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:28:35 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hYlnqkuE7eM/index.html,"The Pentagon official who raised concerns about the Ukraine aid being held in 2019 has submitted her resignation to Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, the Pentagon announced Tuesday. Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) Elaine McCusker will resign effective June 26, Esper said in a statement. ""Since joining the Department of Defense Elaine has worked tirelessly to ensure that our budgeting and audit processes give full value to the taxpayer while meeting the enormous security needs of our nation as well as the men and women who serve it,"" Esper said. ""I am grateful for her dedication to public service and the contributions that she has made to the Department and wish her the very best in her future endeavors."" In March, CNN reported that the White House was withdrawing the nomination of McCusker to be the Pentagon's comptroller. She had served as the acting official in that role and last year, raised concerns about the legality of Ukraine military aid being held by the Trump administration, an issue that ultimately led to President Donald Trump being impeached. McCusker's name -- and qualms about the aid -- have appeared in correspondence between government officials. CNN previously reported that on September 5, McCusker mentioned the ""increasing risk of execution,"" a nod to concerns at the Pentagon that continuing the hold could prevent all the money from being spent. Finally, on the evening of September 11, Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, alerted McCusker that he was releasing the money for Ukraine. ""Copy. What happened?"" McCusker asked. The first line of Duffey's response is redacted. He went on to say he hoped to sign the apportionment to release the money that evening and signed off, ""Glad to have this behind us."" McCusker first raised concerns about the legality of the hold on July 25, according to emails viewed and reported on earlier this year by Just Security, a website focusing on reporting and analysis of national security law and policy. That was the same day as  Trump's now infamous call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the President pressed Zelensky for investigations that could boost him politically. Just Security also reviewed an August 30 email from Duffey to McCusker stating the freeze on aid to Ukraine would continue at the explicit direction of the President despite growing legal concerns within the Pentagon and mounting external questions prompted by news of the hold becoming public just days prior. The documents highlight McCusker's concerns that OMB was not representing the Pentagon's concerns accurately. ""Recognizing the importance of decision space, but this situation is really unworkable made particularly difficult because OMB lawyers continue to consistently mischaracterize the process — and the information we have provided. They keep repeating that this pause will not impact DOD's ability to execute on time,"" McCusker wrote to Esper's chief of staff on August 27 in response to an inquiry about the hold from a defense contractor. When Duffey suggested in a September 9 email to McCusker that the Pentagon, not OMB, would be to blame if the money was not spent, McCusker wrote: ""You can't be serious. I am speechless."" A senior administration official told CNN in January that OMB officials believed that McCusker was exaggerating the numbers about the money that the Pentagon would be unable to spend if the hold wasn't lifted. The official also claimed there were other top Defense Department officials who disagreed with McCusker's conclusions. McCusker was not the first White House nominee to have her offer rescinded. Earlier this month, Trump abruptly withdrew a Treasury Department nomination for Jessie Liu, the former US attorney who headed the office that oversaw Roger Stone's prosecution -- a decision that was directly tied to her former job, CNN learned. Liu resigned shortly after. This story has been updated with additional information. "
73,Analysis: Something shocking happened to Republicans in West Virginia last week,"Last Tuesday in West Virginia, something remarkable happened: 10(!) sitting Republican state legislators -- including the state Senate president and a former House majority leader -- lost in primaries.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:31:46 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8wl_vqQb-Hg/index.html,"Last Tuesday in West Virginia, something remarkable happened: 10(!) sitting Republican state legislators -- including the state Senate president and a former House majority leader -- lost in primaries. That's a stunning number -- especially when you consider that Republicans control a total of 78 seats in the state House (58) and state Senate (20). A little math reveals that almost 13% of all Republicans in the West Virginia state legislature appear to have lost their seats a week ago. (Absentee and provisional ballots are still being counted, but are not expected to overturn any of the results.) In the state Senate, three Republican incumbents were defeated as compared to seven who won their primaries. (Only half of the state's 34 state Senate seats are on the ballot in 2020.) Any time you see that sort of wipeout less than six months before a major national election within the President's own party it's worth trying to answer the question of why. ""Once you put a title on someone, whether it's Senate president or House speaker pro tem, you kind of have a target on your back,"" explained state Del. Daryl Cowles, the current speaker pro tempore who was on the losing end of a primary fight, to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. Which, fair enough. But it's also worth noting that none of the 13 Democrats in the state House and state Senate who were seeking re-nomination lost. So what happened last Tuesday doesn't appear to be solely about throwing the bums (of both parties) out. What else could have been going on? West Virginia has been roiled over the past several years by a battle between the Republican-controlled state legislature and the state's public school teachers. In both 2018 and 2019, there were massive teachers' strikes in the state. The first was to demand pay increases (it worked) while last year's strike was to protest legislation that would create charter schools in the state (among other things.) Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed the education reform bill into law in June 2019 -- over the protests of the teachers' unions in the state. Two of the three GOP state senators who lost primaries a week ago -- including state Senate President Mitch Carmichael -- were beaten by teachers. ""There may be a little bit of payback there,"" John Kilwein, head of the political science department at West Virginia University, told the Parkersburg News and Sentinel. ""Maybe in a couple ways the Republican Party got a message back that this focus of being opposed to the unions and opposed to the teachers and support for the charter schools was not good. Maybe you can only go so far."" There's also this to consider: Republicans are now the dominant political party in the Mountain State. That's a massive change over the last several decades since, for a very long time, West Virginia was a reliably Democratic state. In the seven presidential elections between 1972 and 1996, the Democratic nominee carried the state five times. By 2016, President Donald Trump won the state by 42(!) points. The robustness of the Republican Party in the state means more competition. There's now an entire generation of young Republicans (and not-so-young Republicans) who understand that the only way to get into office is to beat someone in their own party. It's one of the problems that comes with being, essentially, a single-party state. There's never a single reason for why a political cataclysm happens. Voters are complex creatures whose intentions often resist simple explanations. But when we see something like what happened in West Virginia to Republicans last week, we all need to pay attention. Because it could be a sign of unrest -- and desire for change -- that extends well beyond West Virginia's borders. "

Want to Zoom with Brett Favre? That'll run you $5,000 for 10 minutes. Lance Bass is a steal at $1,250. In the bargain bin you'll find mostly cast members from reality shows, including ""90 Day Fiancé,"" ""Survivor"" and ""Real Housewives of Orange County.""

Zoom Video Communications is arguably the biggest beneficiary of the 2020 quarantine. The stock has soared more than 250% so far this year. It's valued at  $67 billion. To put that in perspective: Zoom is now more valuable than Uber. Not bad for a company that's only a little more than nine years old, just went public a little over a year ago and is expected to generate less than $2 billion in annual sales this fiscal year.

Here's just a sampling of what Scott Minerd, the global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, had to say about the Fed's recent heavy-handed efforts to prop up markets: ""It's a troubling precedent that the Federal Reserve is going to sit there and continue to fund these zombie companies that don't deserve to exist.""""There's a point where the Federal Reserve is going to have to pull out a bazooka ... And I think the option of buying stocks on the part of the Fed is on the table.""Quick side note: The idea of the Fed buying stocks is not only unprecedented, it may not even be legal. But the Fed being the Fed, I'm sure they can get around that. On the economic recovery: ""People have totally underestimated how long this is going to take."" Back in February, when US stocks were really on fire, he issued this warning to his clients: ""This will eventually end badly.

75,Airlines ban alcohol in response to Covid-19,"Alcohol sales may have boomed during lockdown, but our return to air travel will be an altogether more sobering experience.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:21:50 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/-pnG3BZXF9Y/index.html," — Alcohol sales may have boomed during lockdown, but our return to air travel will be an altogether more sobering experience. Airlines including Easyjet and KLM in Europe, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines in the United States, and Asia's Virgin Australia, are suspending all or part of their alcoholic drinks service in response to Covid-19. It's part of a widespread revision of the industry's food and drink service to minimize interaction between crew and passengers and to ensure a safer journey for all. With face masks already mandatory on pretty much all flights around the world, and new legislation introduced in January 2020 to curb anti-social behavior on flights, it's another in a line of barriers -- literal and legal -- to getting high in the sky. Many airlines are limiting drink options to water only. As face masks must be kept on other than when passengers are eating and drinking, it's a way of ensuring passengers are lingering over their refreshments for no longer than necessary. Europe British low-cost airline Easyjet resumed domestic routes across the UK and France on June 15, alongside a handful of international routes. While customers can bring food and non-alcoholic drinks on board, at the beginning the only refreshments on offer will be water, which has to be requested from the crew. Food service will resume gradually in coming months. The crew will manage use of toilet facilities -- so it's for the best that passengers aren't knocking back the Guinness and G&Ts. Virgin Atlantic will be issuing passengers with ""Health Packs,"" complete with face masks, surface wipes and hand gel. It too is temporarily removing alcohol on board. KLM, flag-carrier of the Netherlands, has suspended sales of hot and alcoholic drinks, but you can still ask crew for more water and soft drinks. That's in addition to the pre-packed refreshments that will be waiting for you on your seat when you board. Hot meals will only be served on flights longer than nine hours. The UK's flag carrier, British Airways, is suspending its alcohol service in short-haul economy only (its ""Euro Traveller"" class), where customers will instead be offered complimentary refreshments along with a bottle of water. Special meals, including children's meals, are temporarily unavailable. Irish budget airline Ryanair has also resumed a limited flights schedule. It's changed its service so that all food is pre-packaged and must be pre-ordered before flying. Alcohol isn't off the menu, though -- it's chosen to ax its hot drinks service instead, throughout July. The Americas Delta Airlines isn't serving alcohol on domestic flights or within the Americas, but beer, wine and spirits can be found on all other international flights. Over on American Airlines, the airline is limiting food and drink service in the main cabin according to flight length and destination. Access to alcohol, however, is the preserve of long-haul international flights and the folks in First Class. In Asia, Hong Kong's flag-carrier Cathay Pacific will still have drinks available throughout the flight, but the pre-meal bar and pre-poured drinks are temporarily suspended. Virgin Australia is serving all guests complimentary water and a snack, but additional food and drinks aren't currently available for on-board purchase. So if you're traveling this summer, pack plenty of water and healthy snacks, keep your face mask on when not eating or drinking, and be glad that you're being spared alcohol-related dehydration, a major contributor to jet lag."

Katherine Williams-Dunning was 27. Williams-Dunning was driving a 2007 Chevy Tahoe while towing a boat Saturday night in Henry County, Tennessee, when it crashed, according to Wesley Moster, a spokesman for the state's Department of Safety & Homeland Security. Her husband, Tyler Dunning, 29, was in the passenger seat. The SUV, which was traveling south, crossed the dividing median of the highway and began a ""rollover sequence,"" Moster told CNN in an email. It crossed the northbound lanes and finally came to a stop on the east shoulder of the roadway. Williams-Dunning was killed while her husband was flown to the hospital. The investigation into the crash is ongoing, Moster said. The couple married back in October 2015 and had two children, 5-year-old son Beau and 2-year-old daughter Audrey, according to Entertainment Tonight. Williams-Dunning's older sister, singer Holly Williams, grieved her sibling's death in an Instagram post Sunday. ""I have no words. On Friday morning I talked the family into taking this picture and had no idea it would be our last together with my precious little sister Katie. We all went to my great aunts funeral on Thursday whom we all loved dearly, and now we are faced with another one,"" Williams wrote. ""ALL we need is prayers."" She added that her brother-in-law, Dunning, was ""awake and responding."" Celebrities, including actor Reese Witherspoon and model Lily Aldridge, commented under her post with their condolences. ""I'm so so sorry. Praying for your family,"" Witherspoon wrote. Williams-Dunning was the second youngest of Williams Jr.'s five children. While her siblings pursued their own careers in music, she ran a graphic T-shirt company called Weston Jane, which celebrates women and moms.

78,Police officers across the US are quitting,"Since George Floyd's death three weeks ago, the role of America's criminal justice system has been catapulted to the forefront of national conversation with thousands calling for sweeping changes within the country's policing system.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:47:08 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/k4q-Pi3aSJg/index.html,"Since George Floyd's death three weeks ago, the role of America's criminal justice system has been catapulted to the forefront of national conversation with thousands calling for sweeping changes within the country's policing system. Protesters have called on their community leaders to hold officers accountable and defund police departments -- in hopes those funds could be redirected toward other programs. And many local leaders have responded, signing orders changing how departments operate, promising further reform and acting quickly on incidents of police brutality that have surfaced in recent weeks. But as anger bubbles in parts of the country, some US police departments are facing their own crises and some officers have now opted to walk away. In Minneapolis In Minneapolis, at least seven police officers resigned from the department since protests sparked by Floyd's death in late May flooded the city's streets. More than half a dozen officers are also in the process of leaving, a city spokesperson told CNN. The number of officers who are no longer with the department doesn't include the four men who were involved in Floyd's death and were fired, according to Casper Hill, the city's spokesperson, ""There's nothing that leads us to believe that at this point the numbers are so great that it's going to be problematic,"" police spokesman John Elder told the Minneapolis Star Tribune of the departing officers, which include both patrol officers and detectives. ""People seek to leave employment for a myriad reasons — the MPD is no exception,"" Elder said. Members of the department condemned the actions of ex-Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin -- who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes -- in an open letter last week. ""Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and life. This is not who we are,"" said the letter, signed by 14 officers. ""We're not the union or the administration,"" the letter says. In Atlanta Atlanta became the epicenter of protests this week after a black man was shot in the back and killed Friday night. Following Rayshard Brooks' killing, Atlanta's police chief stepped down and the officer who killed the 27-year-old father was fired. A second officer was placed on administrative duty. Atlanta police said in a statement eight officers have resigned from the department this month. ""Our personnel data indicates that we have had anywhere from two to six officers resign per month in 2020,"" Atlanta police said in a statement. The Atlanta Police Foundation earlier reported that 19 officers had resigned ""since the start of social justice protests."" The foundation has since retracted that incorrect number. Prior to Brooks' killing, some were critical of charges that six officers faced after video captured the group violently handling a pair of black college students who were in their car and were stuck in traffic caused by ongoing protests. Those critics included Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields, who had already fired two officers involved, and said she didn't expect charges. Criminal charges ""were never part of any discussion that I had with the Mayor or her administration,"" Shields wrote in the memo provided to CNN by the department. ""I called the DA and strongly expressed my concern, both to the appropriateness and the timing of any charges,"" Shields wrote. In South Florida In South Florida, 10 officers resigned from their city's SWAT unit over concerns about safety, saying they feel ""restrained by the politicization of our tactics,"" according to documents obtained by CNN. The officers sent a letter to Hallandale Beach Police Chief Sonia Quinones, saying they were ""minimally equipped, under trained and often times restrained by the politicization of our tactics to the extent of placing the safety of dogs over the safety of the team members."" They also said they were displeased after the command staff took a knee with activists and others during a demonstration on Monday, according to the letter. ""Until these conditions and sentiments are rectified and addressed, we cannot safely, effectively and in good faith carry out duties in this capacity without putting ourselves and our families at this needless increased level of risk,"" the officers wrote. The officers resigned only from the SWAT unit, not from the police department, Hallandale Beach City Manager Greg Chavarria said. The chief told CNN Monday night she was ""extremely disappointed"" in the officers' decision. ""They walked away from their assignment, they never talked to me in advance and let me know their concerns,"" she said. ""If we're not connecting and we're not communicating, then we're not resolving concerns."" She said what the officers wrote in their memo was inaccurate, adding she didn't kneel to oppose police but to be in solidarity with their community. ""We provided increased training hours, we provided over $100,000 in the last two years in SWAT-specific equipment and then they inaccurately and falsely stated I took a knee in solidarity with the vice mayor, which was not the case. It was in reverence with our community,"" the chief said. In Buffalo In Buffalo, New York, nearly 60 officers resigned from the force's emergency response team over the suspension of two police officers who were caught in a video pushing an elderly protester to the ground. ""Fifty-seven resigned in disgust because of the treatment of two of their members, who were simply executing orders,"" Buffalo Police Benevolent Association president John Evans had previously told CNN affiliate WGRZ. The two officers captured on video were charged with assault and pleaded not guilty. The 75-year-old protester was seen falling to the ground and bleeding from his head. The 57 officers that turned in their resignation did not quit from the force -- but made up the entire active emergency response team of the department, the Buffalo mayor's office told CNN. A few members of the unit are out currently and are not included in the 57 that resigned, according to the mayor's office.

""I am not at liberty to elaborate at this time other than to confirm that his skull was fractured,"" Gugino's attorney Kelly Zarcone said. ""While he is not able to walk yet, we were able to have a short conversation before he became too tired. He is appreciative of all of the concern about him but he is still focused on the issues rather than himself."" CNN has not been able to speak with Gugino directly, but in her press statement, Zarcone passed along a message from him: ""I think it's very unnecessary to focus on me. There are plenty of other things to think about besides me."" Gugino is focused on getting better and he remains in rehabilitation, Zarcone told CNN on Tuesday. ""Barring something unusual and unforeseen, I don't expect much change at all this week,"" she said. Gugino was injured when two police officers shoved him backwards during a protest against racism and police brutality on June 4. Video of the incident shows that he fell to the sidewalk and his head began bleeding as other officers walked by him. Officers Aaron Torgalski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32, each pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault and have been released on their own recognizance without bail. Based on the initial video, police issued a statement that said Gugino tripped and fell, Buffalo Police spokesman Mike DeGeorge told CNN. Police later amended that statement and suspended the officers without pay and opened an investigation. After video of the incident spread widely -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was ""wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful"" -- Gugino became the focus of a conspiracy theory pushed by One America News Network and President Donald Trump that suggested the 75-year-old was an ""ANTIFA provocateur"" and that his serious injury ""could be a set up.""

He served as mayor of New Orleans from 2010 to 2018 and founded E Pluribus Unum to help break down barriers across race and class in the South.  The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. The brutal death of George Floyd has rightly trained our eyes on systemic racism and bias in our criminal justice system and the long history of law enforcement's excessive use of force, which is most often aimed at black Americans. It is clear that nothing short of a complete transformation of policing is necessary to ensure safety for the people of our country. Whether it is implicit or explicit, racial bias is real -- it can influence perceptions and behaviors, with deadly consequences. In 2019, black Americans made up a disproportionate number of the 1,003 people who were shot and killed by the police, according to the Washington Post. It's a hard number to get out of your head. But in the wake of George Floyd's death and the national conversation around police brutality, we must push the debate beyond ending police violence. Ultimately, we need law enforcement, but law enforcement alone will not make us safer. Front-end investments in children and families, community development, education, recreation, job training and social services play a vital role. We must also dramatically reimagine modern policing to instill true public safety. Past efforts at national police reform have been stymied by politics and a lack of will. That need not be the case this time. The good news, thus far, is the debate has shifted from ""why"" to ""when and how far."" Congressional Democrats last week introduced the Justice in Policing Act, the depths of which has never been done before at the federal level and, perhaps most importantly, also encourages changes at the state and local levels.  Republicans leaders like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sen. Tim Scott have said publicly they would be open to supporting certain provisions in the bill proposed. This is long overdue, and we must move federal reforms forward, but the true test will be whether local departments embrace a change in culture. The US Department of Justice was investigating the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD) when I took office. My first act as mayor was to request assistance from the US Department of Justice to completely and totally transform the NOPD. This led to one of the most sweeping consent decrees in the nation's history, which is still ongoing. It required a complete rewrite of nearly every policy and procedure, established strict use of force standards and use of force investigations, as well as training and supervisory standards. Beyond the consent decree, NOPD became an early and voluntary adopter of department-wide body-worn cameras. We established a completely new hiring, training and retraining apparatus. The department's early warning system was completely restructured. We put a civilian attorney in charge of police investigations, including those involving serious uses of force by members of the department. We deepened and strengthened implicit bias and de-escalation training. We also worked on long overdue changes to how patrol officer rankings work and how detectives get promoted. And even beyond police department internal policies, the city mandated standards for arrest, increasing the use of summonses in lieu of arrests for misdemeanor offenses. One of the most successful measures, though, has been a peer intervention program called EPIC, Ethical Policing Is Courageous. Developed by the NOPD in collaboration with community partners, EPIC seeks to get officers involved in weeding out bad behavior within the department and represents a cultural change in policing that equips, encourages, and supports officers to intervene to prevent misconduct and ensure high-quality policing. Redefining police culture that makes peer intervention a positive is key. Christy Lopez, a top DOJ Civil Rights Division official in the Obama administration recently noted, ""Immediate officer intervention also can be far more effective in preserving and restoring police legitimacy than any after-the-fact apology or even prosecution."" All of these efforts, on top of having outside oversight holding us accountable, are showing promising results.  Complaints against officers were down by about 14%, according to a report that compared numbers from 2016 (850 complaints) and 2017 (734 complaints). The percentage of residents satisfied overall with the New Orleans Police Department rose from 33% in 2009 to 54% in 2019. The 2019 homicide numbers were reportedly the lowest since 1971, according to Jeff Asher, a data analyst. This is not to say our reform plans have been a panacea. It has been hard. Systemic racism is hard to overcome. Even more recently, there have been challenges -- including the use of tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse otherwise peaceful yet sometimes aggressive protests, and recent news about a task force that was making improper arrests. And while substantially there, the department still has work to do to be in full compliance with the consent decree.  But the transformation to date is unlike almost any other police department in the country Still, we must go further. We can no longer ask police to handle the failures of our social and educational systems. We must reconstruct the laws and policies in our criminal justice system that unfortunately were designed in large part to oppress rather than assist and support the communities they serve. We must hold local prosecutors more accountable. In order for there to be safety, we need to invest way more on front-end services and less on back-end law enforcement and prisons. Keep in mind that the United States incarcerates a greater share of its population than any other nation in the world. It has not made us safer. Violent crime, and homicide rates in particular, continue to be higher than other developed nations. Other playbooks at reforming policing exist. Under former President Barack Obama, a task force that included national law enforcement leaders outlined a 21st century policing strategies and recommended policy changes, whose work is now carried out by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. Campaign Zero has also started a new campaign called #8cantwait, highlighting eight policies cities and local police departments can adopt to decrease police violence. We know what to do to transform our law enforcement system. We just need courage -- from Congress, governors, mayors, police chiefs, unions, and most importantly, police officers themselves. The women and men of our law enforcement agencies show courage to go out and put their lives on the line each day, but without the will to change culture from within, and without reimagining what is possible, we will never bridge the divide between police and community. Reimagining policing will make us safer. "
81,A black officer intervened when a white cop had a suspect in a chokehold. She was fired.,"Officials in Buffalo, New York, want an investigation into the firing of a black police officer who intervened when a white colleague had a suspect in a chokehold.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:41:43 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/R1H37DTCvtI/index.html,"Officials in Buffalo, New York, want an investigation into the firing of a black police officer who intervened when a white colleague had a suspect in a chokehold. The incident happened in November 2006. At the time, Officer Cariol Horne had served 19 of the 20 years needed to receive her pension, a spokesperson for Horne told CNN. But Horne was fired for intervening and did not qualify for her pension, the city said. ""The message was sent that you don't cross that blue line and so some officers -- many officers don't,"" said Horne in an interview Tuesday with CNN's Brianna Keilar. ""I don't want any officer to go through what I have gone through,"" Horne continued. ""I had five children and I lost everything but [the suspect] did not lose his life. So, if I have nothing else to live for in life, at least I can know that I did the right thing and that [he] still breathes."" To rectify what it perceives as a wrong, the Buffalo Common Council -- the city government's legislative branch -- has submitted a resolution to the New York Attorney General's Office to take a second look at the case. The council references the case of George Floyd, who died after then-Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin's knee was pressed on his neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds on May 25. Chauvin has been fired and charged with second-degree murder. Three other officers on the scene were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. ""There is a responsibility to propose special protections for individual police officers who intervene to protect citizens from excessive use of force situations involving their other officers,"" the council said it its resolution. The resolution calls on the Buffalo Police Department to enforce and train officers on the ""Duty to intervene"" policy within the next 30 days and to check for any attendance discrepancies into the needed days for her to receive her pension. The ""Duty to intervene"" policy calls for officers to protect citizens from unnecessary or excessive use of force, the resolution says. ""We now have a totally different attorney general, we have a total different climate and atmosphere and lens right now, across this world, as it deals with policing in the United States,"" Buffalo Common Council President Darius Pridgen told CNN affiliate WIVB. ""So I think it's an opportune time to look back at this case and to see were there civil rights violations can she be made whole,"" he said. When asked whether she hopes the investigation into her case can lead to her getting a pension, Horne said she hopes so. ""I hope that the mayor does the right thing because, like I said, no officer should go through what I've gone through for doing the right thing."" The New York Attorney General's office told CNN it will not be commenting at this time. CNN has reached out to the Buffalo Police Department regarding this incident.

82,"As protesters decry Brooks' death, a police union official says due process must be served",Newly released records show the officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta last week had several citizen complaints against him prior to the incident.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:50:30 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/gXHj2n7tWpI/index.html,"One day before charges might be filed against the ex-officer who killed Rayshard Brooks, a black Georgia sheriff said the shooting was justified. Brooks, 27, was killed by an Atlanta police officer Friday night outside a Wendy's restaurant after failing a sobriety test, fighting with two officers, taking a Taser from one and running away. Officer Garrett Rolfe was fired after footage showed him shooting at Brooks multiple times from the back as Brooks fled. The second officer, Devin Brosnan, is on administrative duty. Atlanta's police chief promptly resigned. The mayor on Monday called the killing of the black man a ""murder."" But Burke County Sheriff Alfonzo Williams said Rolfe's actions were ""completely justified."" ""We saw in the video that Brooks is engaged in a fight with the officers,"" said Williams, whose county is about 160 miles east of Atlanta. ""Brooks is able to take a non-lethal weapon, a Taser, away from one of the officers, and he flees,"" Williams said Tuesday. ""Brooks turned back to the officers and fired the Taser."" Footage shows the deployed Taser apparently missed an officer. Williams said Brooks' use of the device was extremely dangerous because it could have immobilized the officer for several seconds, possibly allowing Brooks to steal the officer's gun or seriously injure him. ""If an officer is hit with that Taser, all of his muscles will be locked up, and he'll have the inability to move and to respond,"" Williams said. ""This was a completely justified shooting."" Law enforcement analyst disagrees Body camera footage shows that early in the encounter, an officer asked Brooks whether he could pat him down, and Brooks agreed. ""Now you know he's not in possession of a firearm or any other deadly weapon,"" CNN law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey said. After Brooks stole an officer's Taser and apparently fired it, it was very unlikely he'd be able to deploy it a second time, Ramsey said. ""Once you fire the Taser, it has to recycle before it can be used again,"" said Ramsey, a former Philadelphia police commissioner. ""I would doubt very seriously if most citizens would even know how to operate a Taser."" Ramsey said instead of shooting Brooks, the officer could have continued to run after him and call for backup. He noted that Brooks' car was still in the Wendy's parking lot. ""You've got the car. You've asked for his driver's license. You know who he is. So even if you don't get him right now, you can get him later,"" Ramsey said. A decision on possible charges is coming soon Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard Jr. said a decision on whether charges will be filed could come as early as Wednesday. Those charges, he said, could range from voluntary manslaughter to murder. He said he could file charges against both officers. ""If this had been a civilian, there's a possibility charges would have been lodged against them already,"" he said. ""What I think people around the country are saying is: 'We want one system so that both the police and citizens are treated equally.' That's what we are hoping to do by making our decision on Wednesday."" Newly released records from Atlanta police show Rolfe was the subject of a 2016 use-of-force complaint. That resulted in a written reprimand in 2017. Rolfe's record includes several citizen complaints, all with notes that no action was taken. Justin Miller, an attorney for the Brooks family, told CNN that shows a pattern with Rolfe. CNN has reached out to the department for more information on the records and has also reached out to the Atlanta Police Foundation. Rolfe and Brosnan have not responded to repeated requests for comment. Brooks family Attorney L. Chris Stewart said they believe Brooks was murdered but they will wait for the DA to make his announcement. Stewart said he has not spoken with Howard recently. Protesters say excessive force must stop For the past three weeks, protesters across the country have demanded an end to systemic racism following the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor. Brooks' death renewed calls for more police reforms. Atlanta Hawks Head Coach Lloyd Pierce was one of the protesters who denounced police brutality. ""I know one day I'll die a black man ... but I don't want to die because I'm a black man,"" he said. 'I can never get my husband back' Brooks was a father of three young daughters -- ages 1, 2, and 8 -- and a 13-year-old stepson. He had spent much of Friday celebrating his daughter's 8th birthday ahead of a planned birthday party on Saturday. Family attorneys say the 8-year-old daughter waited for her father in her birthday dress that morning. But he never came home. ""There is no justice that can ever make me feel happy about what's been done,"" Brooks' widow Tomika Miller said Monday. ""I can never get my husband back. I can never get my best friend. I can never tell my daughter, 'He's coming to take you skating or swimming lessons.'"" ""It's going to be a long time before this family heals."" Brooks' niece Chassidy Evans said she had been following the protests against police brutality. But ""this time it landed on our front doorstep."" ""Not only are we hurt, we are angry. When does this stop?"" she said. ""We're not only pleading for justice. We're pleading for change."" Fire department looking for arson suspects Atlanta Fire Section Chief James Oliver said that they are still looking for the two women suspected of starting fires at the Wendy's where Brooks was shot. The fire, started on Saturday night, gutted the restaurant. Oliver said the fire was started using multiple incendiary devices, including homemade blow torches, fireworks and combustible materials lit and thrown inside the restaurant. Fire Chief Randall Slaughter said that fire crews were at the scene before the fire was set, but the building was surrounded and they could not access it. One truck was damaged by thrown objects, he said. ""Once we tried to make access and the position became so dangerous for our firefighters, there was no way we were going to allow them to continue to go in and have the possibility of getting hurt themselves,"" Slaughter said.

The six-time Super Bowl winner, who spent 20 seasons with the Patriots, signed with the Buccaneers back in March. ""Excited, humble and hungry ... if there is one thing I have learned about football, it's that nobody cares what you did last year or the year before that ...you earn the trust and respect of those around through your commitment every single day,"" the 42-year-old quarterback wrote on Instagram at the time. ""I'm starting a new football journey and thankful for the Buccaneers for giving me an opportunity to do what I love to do.""

Just hold your side down bro, I got the D Block,"" linebacker Devin White tweeted. But Patriots' fans were obviously upset at the fresh reminder that they were losing the six-time Super Bowl winner who is widely regarded as the greatest NFL quarterback in history. ""I refuse to accept Tom Brady in any other uniform. I'm delusional and I don't care,"" one Patriots fan tweeted. The first time the world will get to see Brady donning his new threads in a game setting is on August 14 when the Bucs go against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the preseason opener.

Butte County District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said the ""historic moment"" should be a signal that corporations will be held responsible for ""recklessly endangering"" lives. The 84 people ""did not need to die,"" Ramsey said. He said the deaths were ""of the most unimaginable horror, being burned to death."" Before sentencing, survivors will testify Wednesday about the losses of their loved ones. No individuals will be sent to prison, Ramsey said. ""This is the first time that PG&E or any major utility has been charged with homicide as the result of a reckless fire. It killed a town,"" Ramsey said, referring to Paradise, which was annihilated by the blaze. According to court documents filed in March, the company will be fined ""no more than $3,486,950,"" and it must reimburse the Butte County District Attorney's Office $500,000 for the costs of its investigation into the blaze. Among other provisions, PG&E must establish a trust, compensating victims of the 2018 Camp Fire and other wildfires to the tune of $13.5 billion, according to the plea agreement included in a regulatory filing. It has to pay hundreds of millions to the town of Paradise and Butte County and cooperate with prosecutors' investigation, the plea deal says. PG&E also waived its right to appeal the case. ""I have heard the pain and the anguish of victims as they've described the loss they continue to endure, and the wounds that can't be healed,"" PG&E Corporation CEO and President Bill Johnson said after the plea. ""No words from me could ever reduce the magnitude of such devastation or do anything to repair the damage. But I hope that the actions we are taking here today will help bring some measure of peace."" Johnson was in court Tuesday, where Butte County Superior Court Judge Michael Deems read the names of each victim as their photos were shown on a screen, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Johnson said the utility would never put profits ahead of safety again. He told the judge that PG&E took responsibility for the devastation ""with eyes wide open to what happened and to what must never happen again,"" KTLA reported. In March, the utility and the state agreed to bankruptcy terms, which included an overhaul of PG&E's board selection process, financial structure and oversight. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, PG&E was responsible for the devastating Camp Fire. Electrical lines owned and operated by PG&E started the fire November 8, 2018, CAL Fire said in a news release. ""The tinder dry vegetation and Red Flag conditions consisting of strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures promoted this fire and caused extreme rates of spread,"" CAL Fire said. PG&E had previously said it was ""probable"" that its equipment started the Camp Fire but that it wasn't conclusive whether its lines ignited a second fire, as CAL Fire alleged. The power company filed for bankruptcy in January 2019 as it came under pressure from billions of dollars in claims tied to deadly wildfires. "
85,The Gatlinburg SkyBridge was shut down after a tourist cracked the glass doing a baseball slide,"A tourist managed to crack the clear glass floor of the largest pedestrian suspension bridge in the United States, forcing the Gatlinburg, Tennessee, landmark to close Monday night for repairs.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:52:23 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/ijsf4HrCAeg/index.html," — A tourist managed to crack the clear glass floor of the largest pedestrian suspension bridge in the United States, forcing the Gatlinburg, Tennessee, landmark to close Monday night for repairs. Gatlinburg's SkyBridge stretches 680 feet across a valley in the Great Smokey Mountains and has three glass panels in the middle that allow visitors to see the ground 140 feet below. The guest ignored the bridge's ""no running, jumping, or bouncing"" rule and attempted to do a ""baseball-style slide"" across glass panels, according to a news release from Gatlinburg SkyLift Park. ""Upon impact, a metal object on the guest's clothing chipped the glass, resulting in noticeable cracks in the protective top layer of one glass panel,"" the release said. The incident happened at about 8:30 p.m. on Monday, and the bridge reopened on Tuesday morning. Christy Grimes, an employee at CNN affiliate WAFF, was vacationing in Gatlinburg and was turned away from the attraction. ""An employee told us that someone managed to break the top layer of glass,"" Grimes told affiliate WVLT. According to the park, the top layer of glass is designed to protect the other two layers of the material and the damage did not affect the structural integrity of the bridge. No one was injured in the incident, and park officials said no one was ever in danger. Developers used more than a million pounds of concrete for its foundation, 3 miles of cable and 1,400 cedar planks to build the bridge, which opened in May 2019."
86,Rents are dropping across the US,"At the end of May, Ilana Freund landed a deal on an apartment in New York City where she will be attending graduate school. She and her roommate signed a lease on a two-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $4,995 a month. It was a significant discount: Similar apartments in the building were going for around $5,300 before the pandemic took hold, according to the listing agent.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:19:53 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GzNemmCQ8OQ/index.html,"At the end of May, Ilana Freund landed a deal on an apartment in New York City where she will be attending graduate school. She and her roommate signed a lease on a two-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $4,995 a month. It was a significant discount: Similar apartments in the building were going for around $5,300 before the pandemic took hold, according to the listing agent. The two roommates were also given one month's rent free and did not have to pay a broker fee, which typically would have cost them 12% to 15% of the annual rent. ""It has been crazy,"" Freund said, ""but we definitely got a very good deal."" ""Pandemic pricing,"" as some agents call it, has arrived across the country as landlords react to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. With many people either losing their jobs or working from home due to the shutdowns, many tenants have chosen to leave their apartments behind in major US cities. And that has pushed rental prices lower in many places across the US. In May, according to apartment listing platform Zumper, the top four most expensive cities -- San Francisco, New York, Boston and San Jose -- all saw rents on median one-bedroom apartments decline from a year ago. In San Francisco, the median rent for one-bedrooms is down 9% from last year to $3,360 and two-bedrooms are down 6% to $4,420, according to Zumper. ""I'm seeing rents are down 10% to 20%, with higher-end and luxury units taking the biggest hits,"" said Dave Chesnosky, an agent with Compass in San Francisco. ""But these drops are dependent on the location and uniqueness of a unit."" Rents are dropping at the high end of the market first as people who are ""renters by choice"" bail on their apartments, said Jeff Adler, vice president and general manager at Yardi Matrix, which tracks the leasing industry. ""Younger, single professionals who weren't attached to the city they were living in said, 'If everything is shut down, why should I stay here? I'll go back home.' Or they doubled up with someone else,"" he said. As more apartments become available, owners have been forced to reduce their rent to increase interest, he said. This has a cascading effect throughout the market as people in the price bracket below find these deals -- perhaps a better apartment for the same price or even less -- and vacate their own apartments. ""If you have a job and a stable income, now is not a bad time to look around and see if you can improve your circumstances,"" said Adler. Steeper drops at higher end In Manhattan, the rents on the highest priced apartments are falling fastest. The median rent for a luxury apartment in May was $7,825 a month, a 10% drop from April, according to a report from brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and appraiser Miller Samuel. The median rent for all Manhattan apartments in May was $3,546, down 3% from April. ""No one is surprised the prices have come down slightly,"" said Hal Gavzie, executive director of leasing at Douglas Elliman in New York City. ""Landlords are doing whatever they can to get vacant apartments filled."" New leases typically spike in May, but last month they were down 62% from the year before, according to the Douglas Elliman report. This is partly due to the shutdown, which prevents rental agents from showing apartments in New York City, said Gavzie. But, he said, more apartments are also available because people just up and left their leases. While many left when the pandemic shut down the city, others left later when the protests over the killing of George Floyd began, Gavzie said. Gavzie said that presents a rare opportunity for those staying in the city. ""Right now is probably when you'll get the best deals you're going to find,"" said Gavzie. ""Once we are able to show apartments in New York, the inventory will diminish and there will be more competition."" During their apartment search, Freund said she and her roommate saw incentives on other rentals as well and every listing they saw waived the broker fee. Plus, the lower rents allowed Freund and her roommate to expand their wish list. ""We wanted to at least have laundry in the building,"" she said. ""As prices were decreasing, we realized we could get laundry in the unit. That was such a win."" New wish list: home office, outdoor space In New York, realistic landlords who provide flexible lease starts, pay the broker's fee or offer incentives are the ones finding renters, said Kristina Paces, an agent at Douglas Elliman. Paces, who leases buildings in lower Manhattan, said landlords she works with have increased their incentives from one month of free rent, to two months with a 12-month lease. In May, 42% of new leases had an owner-paid incentive, up from 35% in April, according to the Douglas Elliman/Miller Samuel report. ""No one is walking in saying, 'Great, I'd love to pay full price,' in this Covid-19 environment,"" she said. What people are willing to pay more for in a rental apartment building is changing as well, said Paces. All those buildings with fancy amenities were competing with each other to offer gyms, pools and movie lounges. Not only are the perks not enticing anyone right now, many aren't even open or usable. Most in demand now: home-office space, an in-unit washer and dryer and outdoor space, said Paces. ""People's offices are closed until January and they are taking that into consideration when looking for apartments.""

87,How the rise of supermarkets left out black America,"If you're like most Americans, you probably think of going to the supermarket and stocking up on groceries as a normal thing, and you take it for granted.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:15:45 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Chd09Xbx-YQ/index.html,"New York If you're like most Americans, you probably think of going to the supermarket and stocking up on groceries as a normal thing, and you take it for granted. But 60-plus years of corporate strategies, white flight and stereotypes about black Americans have made it significantly harder for many black people to access a supermarket than it is for most white people, according to leaders of big cities across the country as well as food policy advocates, historians and urban studies experts. Supermarkets have chased white, suburban customers at the expense of black communities in urban areas, these experts say. Some have described large grocers' avoidance of predominately black areas as ""supermarket redlining,"" evoking post-New Deal federal policies designed to prevent black home ownership in white neighborhoods and promote segregation. The consequence is that for people living in many urban, black neighborhoods, groceries are harder to access and often more expensive. Healthy food is also harder to come by. ""National and regional supermarkets are typically full-service, with an extensive variety and assortment of food at competitive prices. Some even have pharmacies or minute clinics,"" said Anne Palmer, director of the Food Communities & Public Health program at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future. ""By bypassing black or low-income communities, they exacerbated the problem of easy access to healthy food."" On average, in the 50 largest US metro areas, roughly 17.7% of predominately black neighborhoods had limited access to supermarkets, compared to 7.6% of largely white neighborhoods, according to an analysis conducted for CNN Business by the Reinvestment Fund, a nonprofit community development organization. The racial disparities persisted across income lines, according to the analysis, which used a combination of 2016 supermarket location and 2016 Census data. Research from the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing has also found that predominantly black neighborhoods have less access to grocery stores: ""At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets [and] white tracts had the most,"" Hopkins researchers found in their 2014 analysis of census and food retailer data. Supermarkets expanded their presence mainly in the suburbs in the second half of the twentieth century as a result of white flight. In the 1980s, top grocery chains merged and the industry consolidated. That resulted in fewer store locations in cities as the surviving chains closed overlapping locations. Even today, supermarket chains have been reluctant to expand in minority neighborhoods.  Some local leaders claim that's in part because of stereotypes of black communities as poor and crime-ridden. Supermarket chains ""have a demographic location profile that prioritizes communities that are not low income and not African American,"" said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, an organization that opposes concentrated economic power in communities. ""The outcome has a racial bias."" In a statement, Heather Garlich, spokesperson for FMI, a trade group for the food retail industry, said: ""Market, economic and demographic factors influence a company's decision to establish a store. Grocery stores require an adequate customer base and economic support to remain viable; real estate costs and availability are significant factors to determine where and how a store is built."" Supermarkets work closely with community leaders, elected officials and other groups to help bring stores to neighborhoods, she said. But some critics say supermarkets have intentionally avoided black neighborhoods. ""We saw supermarket redlining in black neighborhoods,"" where chain supermarkets either closed down, relocated to suburban areas or chose not to open in neighborhoods with high black populations, said Debarchana Ghosh, assistant professor in the University of Connecticut's department of geography. Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia from 2008 to 2016, said as a member of the city council he spent years trying to bring a grocery store to a largely black area of Philadelphia by offering tax incentives. (ShopRite eventually agreed to come in 2007.) ""We went to virtually every national grocery retailer in our region,"" Nutter said. ""White people don't think black people spend money, and they weren't willing to invest in predominately black neighborhoods."" The rise of suburban supermarkets As mostly white residents left cities for the suburbs during the back half of the twentieth century — spurred by racial unrest across cities in the 1960s — self-service supermarkets and big-box chains saw an opportunity. Grocery store profit margins are razor thin, normally in the range of 1% to 2%. Companies saw the opportunity for greater profits in the largely white suburbs, said Joshua Davis, a historian at the University of Baltimore and author of ""From Head Shops to Whole Foods: The Rise and Fall of Activist Entrepreneurs."" Supermarket chains relocated or built new, larger stores, with wider aisles to stock more food on shelves than they previously had, on cheap, undeveloped suburban land with big parking lots. ""Supermarkets became the most common source for grocery shopping during a time of rapid suburbanization, and their car-dependent large footprint format is designed for suburban sprawl,"" said Jerry Shannon, an assistant professor in the University of Georgia's department of geography. ""Supermarkets were created with suburban residents in mind."" That led to a racial divide in where supermarket chains put new store locations. ""Supermarkets were overwhelmingly focused on a white, suburban, middle-class family of four,"" said Davis. ""They didn't see black and brown customers as being profitable."" In 1993, Business Enterprise Trust, a nonprofit group, characterized the retail industry's attitude, saying, ""it makes no sense to serve distressed areas when profits in the serene suburbs come so easily."" As the suburbs exploded, another shift was taking place in the grocery industry. A spree of mergers and buyouts in the 1980s led to ""fewer, larger supermarkets owned by large chains,"" according to a 1991 report by the University of Connecticut. Fifteen of the top 20 national chains merged or underwent a buyout. These grocers shuttered stores located close together as they bought each other out, hollowing out cities. Newsweek in 1992 reported that ""in Boston, 34 of 50 big-chain markets have closed since 1970. Los Angeles County, which had 1,068 markets in 1970, counted 694 in 1990."" The US Conference of Mayors, a group representing cities with a population of 30,000 or larger, described grocery closures in major cities that year as ""the [supermarket] redlining of urban America."" 'Grocer flight' in Detroit Detroit, a city of around 700,000 residents, 78% of whom are black, is a case study for how the trend of supermarket chains pulling out of black areas in cities and focusing on middle-class suburbs is playing out. There are just three major supermarkets in the city — Two regional chain Meijer stores and a Whole Foods. For seven years in the mid-2000s, Detroit didn't even have a large grocery chain, in part the result of a long history of white flight from the city and underinvestment. A Meijer spokesperson said a new small store — around one-fifth the size of Meijer's two superstores in the city — is scheduled to open in downtown Detroit next year. ""We are also currently looking at additional sites for more small format stores in the city,"" he said. A spokesperson for Whole Foods pointed to its ""Whole Cities Foundation,"" which  has partnered with more than 150 nonprofits in the United States, contributing more than $1.2 million to local communities. Still, around 30,000 people in Detroit don't have access to a full-scale grocer, according to a 2017 Detroit Food Policy Council report, and there are no black-owned grocery stores in the city. The majority of the city is served by around 70 independent grocery stores, said Alex Hill, director of the Detroit Food Map Initiative and an adjunct professor in Wayne State University's Center for Urban Studies. The story in two neighboring white counties is decidedly different. Washtenaw County had eight major supermarkets, and Macomb County had 27 major supermarkets, according to Hill. ""Locally, we've seen grocer flight,"" he said. ""You can find Kroger stores in a ring around the city, but none inside the border of Detroit."" Kroger declined to comment. City leaders and local food policy experts say negative stereotypes of black communities as poor and crime-ridden, and perceived challenges to hire qualified workers, have contributed to supermarkets' decisions to avoid the city. ""Big chains don't see Detroit as a place where they can make money,"" said Winona Bynum, executive director of the Detroit Food Policy Council. ""The perception is that Detroit is a big pit of poverty and black people will steal you blind and try to get things for a nickel."" Garlich, of the grocery trade group FMI, said in a statement that recently, its members have been ""conducting listening tours within their own companies and working with local business groups to address bias, reject discrimination and assess how they can better meet the needs of the neighborhoods they serve.""

The company announced that businesses can pre-order Spot for a mere $74,500. The four-legged agile robot has garnered attention for the tasks it can perform, which include running, climbing stairs, and even reminding people to practice social distancing in the Covid-19 era. Tuesday's announcement opens availability up for the dog, which was previously used exclusively by ""domestic and international businesses and research facilities,"" the website said. It's generally used for inspections on construction sites or similar situations. ""The combination of Spot's sophisticated software and high performance mechanical design enables the robot to augment difficult or dangerous human work,"" Marc Raibert, chairman and founder of Boston Dynamics,  said in a release. ""Now you can use Spot to increase human safety in environments and tasks where traditional automation hasn't been successful."" Spot is quite athletic. It can run about 5.2 feet per second, has cameras for eyes that give it a 360-degree range of vision, is dust- and water-proof, and can operate in temperatures ranging from -4 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit. The dog will ship in 6 to 8 weeks. Spot's history Boston Dynamics first introduced Spot in 2015. An introductory video collected 7.3 millions views, and additional videos about Spot have continued to draw attention over the years. After all, this robotic canine can twerk and moonwalk, and received an outpouring of sympathy on social media when its creators released a video of researchers kicking the dog to demonstrate its balance. Boston Dynamics started in 1992 as a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and was purchased by Google in 2013. Four years later, Google (GOOGL) sold the company to Japan's SoftBank -- one of the firms  behind Pepper, which is billed as the world's first robot capable of reading human emotions. --CNN's Michelle Toh and Jessie Yeung contributed to this report.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Read more opinion on CNN. Last week, novelist, director and television writer John Ridley -- an Academy Award winner for his screenplay for the movie ""12 Years a Slave"" --  wrote a brief but compelling op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, asking HBO (a sister company of CNN under the ownership of WarnerMedia) to take the movie ""Gone With the Wind"" off of its much-hyped new streaming platform HBO Max. Ridley wrote that the movie ""glorifies the antebellum south. It is a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.""  In Ridley's estimation, the film ""continues to give cover to those who falsely claim that clinging to the iconography of the plantation era is a matter of 'heritage, not hate.'"" Just a day after Ridley's op-ed ran, HBO temporarily pulled the film from streaming. There's a deeper conversation to be had about how ""Gone With the Wind""'s racist depictions and white-supremacy-indulgent view of our nation's past should be addressed today, which University of Chicago professor and Turner Classic Movies co-host Jacqueline Stewart goes into here. But in an era where we're finally challenging some of our society's most deeply anchored (and frankly, cherished) pillars of oppression, we should also consider the broader question raised by Ridley's op-ed and other recent articles: What should we do with cultural artifacts that reflect grotesque and shameful aspects of our history? ""Gone With the Wind"" is hardly the only movie that celebrates America's era of slavery. It's not even the only such film that's considered a ""classic"" -- D.W. Griffith's explicitly racist work of Ku Klux Klan propaganda, ""The Birth of a Nation,"" appeared alongside ""Gone With the Wind"" on the American Film Institute's 100th anniversary list of the ""100 greatest movies,"" as picked by a jury of 1,500 film creators, critics and academics. That list also included ""The Jazz Singer,"" the 1927 drama that made a superstar out of a blackface-wearing Al Jolson, and Disney's 1940 animated epic ""Fantasia,"" whose original ""Pastoral Symphony"" sequence features a sharply offensive depiction of a little black centaur with stereotypical features and a screen role that can generously be described as servile. Also on the list of classics: films that present retrograde depictions of trans people (""Tootsie,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"") and the disabled (""Psycho,"" ""Forrest Gump""); the 1961 adaptation of the musical ""West Side Story,"" with its abundant Puerto Rican caricatures and a very white Natalie Wood in the Latinx role of Maria; and ""Annie Hall,"" directed by the multiply problematic Woody Allen. The fact is, our past is full of problematic faves, which we've chosen to address in wildly uneven fashion. ""The Birth of a Nation"" isn't on any major streaming platform, but it's available on Sling, Dish Network's streaming subsidiary, and on the library platform Kanopy, which calls it ""profoundly influential and controversial."" ""The Jazz Singer"" can be rented on Amazon Prime, among many other platforms -- all of which describe it as a seminal film and reference its groundbreaking Jewish themes, without mentioning its blackface content or explaining the damaging history of blackface minstrelsy. Disney digitally removed its stereotypical centaur from all releases of ""Fantasia"" after its original run, and has stamped warnings about ""outdated cultural depictions"" on other films, like the 1941 animated feature ""Dumbo"" (which contains a bird whose actual character name is ""Jim Crow""), 1953's ""Peter Pan"" (which features extreme caricatures of Native Americans) and pretty much every animated depiction of a Siamese cat in the company's history (caricatured orientalist renderings and ching-chong antics). And Disney has essentially indicated it will never rerelease what some call its ""most notorious movie,"" ""Song of the South,"" a live-action/animated pastiche that features Amos 'n' Andy castmember James Baskett as ""Uncle Remus"" telling black folktales to the grandkids of a white plantation owner. Baskett  --  who was not invited to the premiere due to segregation -- was later awarded an honorary Oscar for his performance, making him the first black male actor to receive an Academy Award. And because the film also starred a live-action Hattie McDaniel, it's also the first film to have featured two Oscar-winning black actors on screen at the same time. The fact that this milestone in African American history is now essentially unavailable for viewing (although the movie still serves as the storybook theme for Disney's popular Splash Mountain amusement park attractions) highlights one concern with simply pulling movies out of circulation -- doing so leads to both disposal of evidence of oppression and erasure of milestones of resistance. But there are equally significant issues with editing out repugnant content or with simply stamping them with warnings.. So what approach makes the most sense given our desire to evolve beyond our problematic past without, presumably, denying it? I've found myself in the thick of this debate before, most notably in the context of rereleases and showcases of the much-beloved 1961 Audrey Hepburn film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (which was one of several hundred movies nominated for, but not selected as, one of AFI's top 100). Anyone who's seen the film knows that, embedded amid its agile, comic-romantic patter and lyrically optimistic view of New York, is one of the most egregious yellowface performances in cinematic history: Mickey Rooney's slant-eyed, bucktoothed, living anti-Asian propaganda poster I.Y. Yunioshi. In 2011, when I was still in New York and the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservatory decided to show the film as part of its publicly funded free screening series, my longtime friend Ursula Liang, a veteran documentarian and journalist, organized a boycott of the series in response. I disagreed with the boycott then, because my instincts favor the encouragement of contextualization and counter-speech, rather than attempts to erase or suppress ugly history. Unlike statues and monuments, which are merely glorified gravestones, popular culture is a living entity, constantly being commented on and referenced. We can't go back in time and alter the circumstances that led to the creation of abhorrent works, repellent narratives and distorted images. As a result, removing them from view actually makes it harder to contend with them. It allows creators, companies and audiences to comfortably pretend they never existed, and to move frictionlessly onward without engaging in real structural change in the present. ""Literally the easiest thing to do [with repulsive content] is to remove it -- it's not an act of courage, solidarity or progress to do so,"" Rebecca Carroll, author of ""Uncle Tom or New Negro?"" and ""Saving the Race,"" and host of WNYC's race and culture podcast ""Come Through,"" told me. She likened it to the black square posted on social media by would-be Black Lives Matter allies. ""It's what you do when you don't have the right words, to buy time hoping things will blow over. But it shouldn't be so easy; it should be really hard and super uncomfortable. Struggle with your answer. I'm here. I'll wait."" To John Ridley's credit, his op-ed didn't ask for permanent removal of ""Gone With the Wind"" from HBO Max, but rather for it to be pulled back until it could be framed with appropriate statements and framing. The question is whether a simple ""trigger warning,"" readily skipped or ignored, does much to ""contextualize"" the film -- not to mention why such words weren't already available and in place, given that HBO and CNN sister channel TCM (also owned by WarnerMedia) had addressed the film's problematic aspects last year, during its 80th anniversary. ""It doesn't solve the white supremacy that made it to begin with,"" Franklin Leonard, founder of screenplay discovery platform The Black List, told me in an interview. ""It does not go back in time and rightfully put Hattie McDaniel at the Oscars ceremony, which she was not allowed to attend when she won [due to segregation]. It doesn't change that Hollywood thinks of black-led and directed movies as having less value, especially abroad, even when data says otherwise. All it does is paper over these failures. If you really want to put ""Gone With the Wind"" in context, do it by addressing Hollywood's historic lack of black stories told by black people."" Leonard noted as well that an as-yet-unproduced script about the making of ""Gone With the Wind,"" told from the point of view of McDaniel, exists -- the widely celebrated ""Selznick's Folly,"" written by Gesha-Marie Bland. He asked: ""What better way is there to understand 'Gone With the Wind' than to make that movie, from the perspective of the black actor who won an Academy Award for her performance?"" Yes, making movies takes time. But Bland's script first surfaced in 2017. And ""Gone With the Wind"" has been around for 81 years. As Carroll put it to me, ""We've known this was a problem for eight decades, that there were profoundly offensive things about this movie, not to mention the racist society and culture and institutions around it."" The question she asked, however rhetorical, says it all: ""This was not a pop quiz, America. We had time to study. How could we be scrambling now to put things in place?"" "
90,Trump isn't aging well,Donald Trump is not coping well.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:59:58 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nHphi1_V9c4/index.html,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author with Peter Eisner of ""The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Donald Trump is not coping well. As he turned 74 last weekend, the oldest man ever to assume the presidency got all defensive about how he looked walking down a ramp at West Point. In truth, his slow-mo shuffle didn't reveal anything that should embarrass a senior citizen. What was truly troubling was what Trump revealed the next day, when he shouted on Twitter: ""THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!"" The tweet harked back to Richard Nixon, who was president when the term ""silent majority"" was first used in 1969. It revealed how even in these troubled times, with the pandemic death toll passing 115,000 and citizens crying out for an end to police violence against minorities, the President is stuck in the past, out of step with a country that has changed practically overnight. Some of the change is evident in the streets, where citizens of every race, religion, ethnicity and age group have joined a nationwide protest movement that recognizes police violence against African Americans and insists that Black Lives Matter. More proof of a changed society can be found in a recent Gallup poll that found four-in-10 support some aspects of socialism. Trump even seems to be losing the support of high-ranking military leaders as he refuses to consider renaming bases named for Confederate officers who waged war against the United States. Trump is so incapable of adapting to change that he's been lapped by NASCAR: It recently banned the Confederate flag, which has long been waved by fans at its tracks. Even the National Football League, which engaged in a long row with players who knelt to protest racial injustice as the National Anthem was played, has reversed field. Locked in his increasingly isolated social and political views, Trump sticks to his old tricks, like calling on the ""silent majority"" because he's apparently incapable of seeing modern America. For those who don't remember, or never learned about the term's origin, the ""silent majority"" was first invoked by President Nixon to argue that most Americans supported the war in Vietnam. In fact, polls done at the time showed that most believed the country's involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake. Similarly wrong was Nixon's claim that his ""majority"" was silent. Pro-war Americans argued their side of things in political debates and kitchen-table discussions. They paraded and rallied, and a few would join in an organized attack -- the Hard Hat Riot of 1970 -- on anti-war activists. If the phrase ""silent majority"" was so inaccurate, what about it would appeal to Trump? Well, it's not that he was all for America's war effort. As Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan he ""was never a fan"" of the war. It's more likely that, as a marketing expert, the reality TV host who made ""You're fired!"" his catch phrase loves the way that Nixon's two-word term communicated so much to his political base. Nixon's silent majority was, everyone knew, middle class, middle-aged, Christian, white and conservative, and they supported him. As Trump leans on the term he reveals himself to be not only nostalgic, which is always a hazard for the aging, but a victim of another common problem among older folks: inflexibility. To be clear, this problem can afflict people of all ages, and it's also true that many seniors possess nimble minds. However, Trump has long shown he is rigidly attached to a bygone era, and has demonstrated an inability to recognize change and adapt to it. Take, for example, the political injury he suffered when he scheduled a rally for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. As much of America knows, the date marks the annual Juneteenth celebration of African Americans' emancipation. (The name derives from the day when Union forces notified slaves in Texas that they were free.) Long recognized in black communities, the celebration of Juneteenth has gained popularity in most corners of the nation. Last year the Republican National Committee marked the day with a proclamation. Trump's Senate ally Tim Scott has said the President didn't understand the significance of Juneteenth (he changed the date of the rally when people pointed it out). This is a sign of a man living in an isolated past. So, too, is Trump's selection of Tulsa for his campaign rally. Tulsa is the site of what has been called the worst racial massacre in US history. White mobs burned more than 1,000 black homes and businesses. Deaths were estimated at between 100 and 300. For Trump to pick Tulsa, especially when the country is in the middle of coast-to-coast protests over police violence against black Americans, reflects either a colossal lack of awareness or monstrous cruelty. The way Trump acts and speaks often makes him look like a mean old man. Take his administration's decision to change the rules so health insurance companies can discriminate against transgender people. Many larger insurers opposed the change, which was announced on Saturday. Two days later, the Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender people. This Supreme Court is never on the leading edge of radical change, but even the justices seated on this court -- six of whom qualify for Medicare -- showed they understand America in a way that the president does not. Our President's inflexible mind is on display every time he calls out for ""law and order"" in response to civil rights protests that are overwhelmingly peaceful and supported by great majorities of Americans. (Perhaps Trump's mind is stuck in the 60s.) He did himself a similar disservice when during a recent press conference where he was questioned by female reporters he appeared to muse nostalgically about the days when women were meek and retiring. Again, we must all recognize that Trump's rigidity says nothing about all older people. (Follow the 84-year-old Dalai Lama on Twitter and you'll see what I mean.) However, in the President's case the inability to adapt does seem to be the sign of a man who is not aging well. He appears even more defensive and reactionary than he was when he was elected. And like an out-of-touch founder of a business he's no longer capable of running, he could do a whole lot of damage on his way out the door.  "
91,Remarkable idiocy of Trump rally in Tulsa,"Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:10:39 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/wqB7kc920_M/index.html,"Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery. And then I was startled that he backed down and delayed the rally by a day. I will let others examine Trump's cruelty in stoking racial divisiveness at such a historical flashpoint. Let others comment on his flippant disregard of public health experts as he ridicules mask wearers as unmanly of PC for caring about keeping themselves and others safe from Covid-19. Instead, I will focus on the remarkable idiocy of staging a large indoor public gathering in Tulsa just now. Tulsa may not be the single worst place in the US to have a mask-free and liability-free rally, though the just identified Whirlpool plant outbreak there may place it in the running. Indeed, cases are going up sharply in Tulsa County (from 7-day rolling average of 13.6 cases to 53.37 cases for most recent two weeks) signaling substantial community transmission. The disease appears disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics who constitute 13% of the population but 27% of the Covid-19 cases. Furthermore, Tulsa is near the border of several states; Trump's rally is likely to draw from these areas as well. Over in Arkansas, four counties at the Oklahoma border -- Benton, Washington (home of Fayetteville), Crawford, and Sebastian (home of Fort Smith) -- have experienced sharply increasing case rates in the last two weeks. This is likely due to the concentration of meatpacking plants in the area, Nationally, these areas have been connected to Covid-19 transmission due to the tight quarters in processing lines and other areas in busy plants. Tyson Foods, the second largest meatpacking company in the US, is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, which straddles Benton and Washington Counties. It is a mere 100 miles from Tulsa. Tulsa also is a few hours down the road from the southwest corner of Missouri. Jasper (home of Joplin), McDonald and Newton Counties each have gone from almost no cases two weeks ago to more than five cases daily per county -- in Jasper's case, nearly 10 (again, rolling 7-day average). This has led local authorities to reinstitute some precautions. The source of the increase is not known, though adjacent Barry County features a chicken meatpacking plant that has seen its first two cases. As we have witnessed repeatedly, today's two cases may presage tomorrow's frantic headline. So, from a strict public health perspective, the selection of Tulsa is a terrible decision. So why the choice? Yes, Tulsa is an extremely conservative city with wonderful cheeseburgers and a deluxe golf course, as well as a city where he has found enthusiastic support at past rallies, but this is true of many cities in the South. Is the choice really just another manifestation of Brutalist politics? As a native Oklahoman, I have a theory: Oral Roberts. Oral Roberts and the hazy world of faith healing. I know this topic quite well. As a kid, on Sunday mornings, my brothers and I used to watch Oral Roberts on television. Our Hebrew Sunday School started at 10 a.m., so we killed time in the early hours watching the faith healing shows till it was time to go listen to the rabbi. Importantly, this was before Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and the other preachers with high production values crowded out the field. The Oral Roberts shows then were grainy and uncertain with a jittery camera and fluctuating sound that made them strangely sincere. Watching, my brothers and I felt confusion and awe, wondering if they were kidding or if they were actors or if they were insane or if they maybe were being cured -- I mean it seemed so convincing in its own way. Rows of people looking up, believing and eager and happy despite (or because of) the scene's basic lack of credibility. They shrieked and clapped as Oral Roberts' touch and prayer healed person after person. Which brings us to now and the Trump rallies. For me, the most unsettling feature as he gloats and preens his hour upon the stage is the hypnotic connection between him and his crowd. Because these are the very faces I saw on my Sunday morning TV -- those of people who are witnessing an incredible miracle. Tulsa therefore is the perfect place for the President to resume his campaign. Not only does he get a groveling crowd and a chance to cruelly wink at the city's racist past but because he is guaranteed something he can't find any place else: an arena full of people raised on the exhilarating lunacy of a giant tent revival.

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion articles at CNN. Near the outset of the grueling war against Covid-19,  President Donald Trump directed my agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to recommend the postponement of non-emergency elective surgeries and procedures. The looming threat of a shortage of personal protective equipment and other supplies for health care workers in the face of a surge in cases made this the right call under the circumstances. Thankfully, providers around the country -- willing to make a financial sacrifice for the good of their country -- heeded that call. At the same time, it also meant patients might have to forgo necessary care until the situation stabilized. Fortunately, President Trump's dramatic expansion of payments for Medicare telehealth  has successfully blunted some of the impact. It allowed patients to access their clinicians while staying safe at home. This virtual care has been especially important for beneficiaries most vulnerable to the virus and healthcare workers who were spared unnecessary exposure to it. When it comes to telehealth, it took a crisis to push our country to a new frontier. That being said, telehealth can never replace what was and remains the gold standard: in-person care. Physicians will always need to listen to their patients' heart and lungs; children will always need their vaccinations; and adults cannot go too long without cancer screenings. Indeed, the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a recent call with CMS, painted a haunting picture of refrigerator upon refrigerator of unused children's vaccines in pediatric offices around the country after a 60-80% drop in childhood vaccinations. If we fail to resume the vaccination of our children, we run the risk of a resurgence -- but this time, of long-vanquished conditions such as measles or mumps. While we continue to grapple with the virus, the sacrifices of the American people and heroic health care workers on the frontlines have brought us a long way from where we were two months ago. Telehealth will remain an important tool, but some areas of the country should also begin resuming in-person care for those who need operations, procedures, preventive care, or evaluation for chronic conditions. The Trump administration has always understood that the public health and Americans' economic health have a reciprocal relationship to one another. Just as public health is the first prerequisite for economic health, unnecessary economic contraction can inflict a devastating public health toll as people put off important procedures or preventative care -- and physician practices fold. More than half of primary-care practices have sustained a greater than 50% reduction in their patients, according to nonprofit Primary Care Collaborative.  The Trump administration worked with Congress to obtain a historically unprecedented $175 billion in relief for hospitals and other providers. Nevertheless, even large health care systems have furloughed tens of thousands of staff. For the financial survival of a large portion of our nation's health care system -- and the critical medical care they provide -- we must gradually reopen. CMS has put out detailed recommendations to help states and localities to do exactly that. These recommendations -- which last week entered Phase 2 -- are a part of the President's guidelines on reopening, which contain a number of thresholds -- regarding case numbers, surge capacity and testing -- that should be met before moving on to any of the three phases. Once they are met, clinicians and healthcare facilities should partner with their local and state health officials to determine a path forward based on CMS' recommendations. As part of Phase 2 of the President's plan, they should begin to resume in-person care as long as it will not jeopardize their surge capacity. Specified non-Covid-19 care sites will be critical so patients know it is safe to get the care they need. Face masks, physical distancing, limitation of visitors and careful screening of all patients and staff members remain essential. Whenever possible, testing should be conducted before a patient comes in for a scheduled procedure. Americans need their health care. We have seen a dramatic drop in cancer screenings; we know from our internal data that the number of cataract surgeries performed during the pandemic has decreased; and we are concerned about those not seeking care for chest pain, new lumps and myriad other symptoms. Our Phase 2 recommendations include specific information and recommendations for patients seeking to receive treatment safely. I want to reassure Americans that their doctors, hospitals, and health systems are taking great care to keep them safe when they venture out to get the care they need. All across this nation, we are seeing pharmacies, physician offices and hospitals making use of newly expanded testing capacity to carefully test patients  and staff for Covid-19 when clinically necessary, preparing for any outbreaks, and working to secure a reliable means of obtaining the supplies they need. Parents should feel safe bringing their children to see their pediatricians.  Adults should seek evaluation of nagging symptoms that don't go away. The American health care system and the general public made heroic sacrifices to meet the generational challenge posed by Covid-19. That challenge continues, but for many areas of the country in a different way. It is time for health care in the US to safely but steadily resume. "
93,What the pandemic means for our summers,"Every day we are bombarded with new numbers -- 20,000 new infections and 800-1,000 new deaths every day; projections such as the total US death toll reaching 130,000 by July 4.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:25:00 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KouEVhllYFw/index.html,"This is the first in a series of regular columns on making choices in the era of Covid-19 by Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. His research focuses on the evolution of the immune system and how animals defend themselves from infection. Follow him on Twitter @ErinBromage. The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Every day we are bombarded with new numbers -- 20,000 new infections and 800-1,000 new deaths every day; projections such as the total US death toll reaching 130,000 by July 4. Our responses to hearing these numbers seem to vary widely -- some of us lock ourselves away in our homes, while others tell ourselves the threat of infection is over. Rather than running to one of these extremes, it would be better for people to understand the risk and to make choices based on information. But with so much news and data hitting us from so many  different sources, how do we make good choices for ourselves and our families? Most people would look at the number of new cases per day and think this would be a good metric, but it's not. Cases per day can be manipulated by the number of tests processed per day. When states test more often, they find more infected people. And testing more every day is a good thing. Why testing matters Every person who tests positive to the virus can be subsequently isolated, which breaks a transmission chain. You want to see your state testing more, so let's not crucify states that are increasing their testing when they report the inevitable result of an increase in confirmed cases -- especially because the alternative is far worse. If your state tests fewer people, then the true dynamics of what is going on will be hidden. The key numbers to watch are how many of the daily tests come back positive, as well as the weekly trend. Are the weekly numbers rising, staying flat, or falling? In a state where anyone can be tested, we want fewer than 2% of all tests to be positive. In states where they are selectively testing and testing hotspots, then we want the number to be below 5%. In both cases, the lower the number the better the state is doing at responding to the pandemic; a decline in the percentage of positive tests also is a good sign. Nationally, the percentage of tests that come back positive is about 4.5% and flat, but this number varies greatly depending on the state and county. Currently, 16 states and Puerto Rico are above 5% of testing positivity and in many of those states the trend in percentage of positive tests is going up. One of the most concerning states is Texas. Daily cases are increasing, testing is flat, and the number of positive tests is high (9.7%) and increasing. This may signify that they are testing largely in hotspots, but the overall trend is not good. In contrast, the early hard-hit states like New York, Massachusetts, and Michigan are all doing well and improving. We know this because the percentage of tests that come back positive and the daily number of new infections is falling. You can check how your state is doing here. The truth about herd immunity One of the questions I am often asked is about herd immunity Many of you may have heard that the pandemic will be over when we achieve herd immunity. For herd immunity to protect us, however, we need to get between 60% to 80% of the US population immune to this virus. If we reach 80% of the population being immune, the virus would have a very hard time finding a new susceptible host to infect. But immunity can only occur by natural infection or vaccination, and there is no guarantee that immunity from natural infection will be long-lasting. Only time will tell. Even in the hardest-hit states, such as New York, only 20% of the residents of New York City have been exposed and successfully fought off the infection, compared to only 2.6% of the people in the Finger Lakes region of the state. This means that the city would need another two to three outbreaks, similar in magnitude to the one in April, to achieve herd immunity through natural exposure. The rest of the state would need years to get to this same goal. Epidemiologists believe that only 2-5% of the US population nationally has been exposed to the virus and recovered, and infections have not been distributed evenly throughout the population. This puts us a long way from beating this virus through natural exposure and the prospect of a successful vaccine remains uncertain. Therefore, we must find a way to live with this virus without sacrificing 1% of our population or going back to the strict restrictions of March and April. However, a second wave of high infection rates and similar mortality rates is avoidable. What does this mean for your summer? Our choices over the coming months will determine the trajectory of this pandemic. If we continue to pursue activities that pose a high risk for infection, such as large indoor gatherings, then we will hear the roar of that second wave sooner than later. If we take a more measured approach, by improving hand hygiene, limiting daily interactions with other people, maintaining physical distance and increasing face mask use when we can't maintain the distance, then businesses can operate safely, people can return to work and the activities our children are missing can resume. Our goals must be to lower the risks of infection and reduce harm. Ultimately, we must all get used to continually tuning our behavior based on local, county and statewide trends in the data. If I were living in the beautiful state of Montana, where there is only a handful of new cases per day, where they are testing well, and only 0.4% of their tests are positive and that trend is decreasing, I would feel much more comfortable eating inside a restaurant and socializing indoor with friends. On the other hand, if I was living in a county where the test-to-positive ratio was at 10%, limiting daily interactions, physical distancing and mask use would become critical to lower the risk of infection. Even at Montana's envious numbers (0.4%), a gathering of 250 people would mean that at least one of those people in attendance would be infected and could infect others. And in another state, the thought of putting 19,000 people into an indoor venue for a rally, when the infection rates are already much higher than Montana, certainly has my attention. Despite the threat of infection, there are many things I am looking forward to this summer: my first meal at a restaurant (dining outdoors), visiting with more than one or two households at a time, and spending time at the beach. These interactions will be a little different than last summer. We will have to keep personal risks and risk mitigation measures in mind, but these adjustments are well worth the payoff of getting to enjoy some of my family's usual summertime activities. We all have a responsibility to reduce harm, not just to ourselves, but also to the greater community. Our actions, and the choices we make over the coming weeks and months, will dictate what comes next and, dare I suggest, even decide whether and when we have a second wave. "
94,SCOTUS made a monumental ruling,Monday's Supreme Court ruling that federal law prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender people in the workplace is a monumental step forward toward justice and equality -- and is potentially a watershed moment for the court itself.,"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 21:43:50 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/v_AF63gLNZM/index.html,"In this weekly column ""Cross Exam,"" Elie Honig, a CNN legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. Post your questions below. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. Monday's Supreme Court ruling that federal law prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender people in the workplace is a monumental step forward toward justice and equality -- and is potentially a watershed moment for the court itself. The decision, Bostock v. Clayton County, is powerful in its plainspoken logic and clear-eyed view of equality: ""An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids."" And the court's opinion is notable for the ideological coalition comprising the six-justice majority: Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Neil Gorsuch -- both Republican-appointed justices who typically side with the court's conservative bloc -- joined the four generally liberal Justices, all appointed by Democratic presidents (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan). Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh -- all conservative appointees -- dissented. The opinion also stands as a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, whose Justice Department argued in the Supreme Court last year that the law does not protect gay and transgender people against discrimination. The Trump administration took the wrong side of the law and, ultimately, history.  And it is impossible to ignore that today's ruling was authored by Gorsuch -- whom Trump himself nominated to the court in the first place. Within the next few weeks, the court will likely deliver more rulings that could have seismic impact on national public policy. And those decisions will tell us much about the court itself -- most importantly, whether it can rise above the pronounced partisan and ideological division that has defined it in recent years. The court is scheduled to release opinions on all remaining cases argued during this term by the end of June. Three especially consequential cases remain undecided. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. The court is expected to determine whether President Donald Trump has legal authority to rescind DACA, a 2012 executive action by President Barack Obama that allowed certain undocumented immigrants (dubbed ""Dreamers"") who came to the United States under age 16 to apply for protection from deportation. This ruling will impact roughly 700,000 people who had active DACA protections in September 2017, when the Trump administration announced its intent to end the program. Louisiana abortion law.  The Supreme Court is expected to deliver a major opinion on abortion when it decides on the constitutionality of a Louisiana law requiring doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Opponents of the law argue that it unduly restricts access to abortion, noting that it would leave only one doctor in the entire state licensed to provide abortions. Proponents counter that the law promotes legitimate health and safety concerns. The Louisiana law is virtually identical to a Texas law that the Supreme Court struck down in 2016, and could require the court to articulate under what circumstances it will depart from established precedent. Trump's tax returns. The dispute over congressional and prosecutorial subpoenas to private financial firms seeking Trump's tax returns impacts one person directly -- Trump -- but it has major implications for our constitutional balance of powers. The court is expected to determine the scope of congressional power to issue subpoenas in furtherance of its legislative function, and whether the President has ""absolute immunity"" from even being investigated criminally while in office. This decision will go a long way toward determining whether the president is, in fact, above the law. Beyond the obviously high stakes posed by these cases, these next few weeks will be a defining stretch for the court itself. An undeniable partisan divide on the court exists and persists. A series of 5-4 rulings (with Roberts siding with the conservative bloc) will deepen the existing ideological divide and will undermine public confidence in the court as a non-partisan entity charged solely with interpreting the law, regardless of political implications. But if Roberts shows genuine independence, and if the court can reach sensible conclusions that cut across established fault lines, then public confidence may return. Watch the court carefully over the next few weeks. Much hangs in the balance. Now, your questions: Alicia (Minnesota): Could the fact that George Floyd and Derek Chauvin both worked at the same nightclub be relevant at trial? The fact that Floyd and Chauvin worked at the same nightclub could become relevant and admissible at trial but it depends on whether more details emerge about their relationship. The club owner said Floyd and Chauvin ""would have crossed paths"" but she ""wouldn't characterize them as knowing each other."" More facts could emerge. If, for example, additional evidence establishes some relationship between them -- particularly any hostility Chauvin might have felt toward Floyd -- then it certainly could become admissible to prove Chauvin's motive to hurt or kill Floyd. But in the absence of any such additional evidence, the fact that they worked at the same place is unlikely to be relevant at trial. Christine (California): Is there any concern that, by charging a second-degree murder, prosecutors have overcharged the case against Chauvin and run the risk of an acquittal by the jury? Minnesota state prosecutors have charged Chauvin with second-degree murder as the ""lead,"" or most serious, charge. Under that charge, prosecutors must prove that Chauvin intentionally assaulted Floyd, resulting in Floyd's death (but not necessarily that Chauvin intended to kill Floyd). I believe the evidence supports a second-degree murder charge -- particularly the cellphone video that shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. But the jury's decision will not be all or nothing solely based on that second-degree murder charge.  Prosecutors also have filed lesser charges of third-degree murder (meaning the defendant committed ""an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind, without regard for human life"") and second-degree manslaughter (meaning the defendant negligently ""creates an unreasonable risk, and consciously takes chances of causing death or great bodily harm to another""). The jury will vote separately on each of the three charges against Chauvin. So, even if the jury acquits Chauvin on the most serious second-degree murder charge, it still could find Chauvin guilty on either or both of the lesser charges. In a sense, prosecutors have built in a safety net, or a fallback provision, by charging the lesser offenses. Victoria (Massachusetts): Could the Justice Department charge the officers in the Floyd case with a hate crime? Possibly. The Justice Department announced that it has opened an investigation and ""has made the investigation a top priority and has assigned experienced prosecutors and FBI criminal investigators to the matter."" There is a federal hate crime law, which applies where a defendant causes bodily injury to another person because of the person's race, color, national origin or other specified characteristics. So, the Justice Department would need to prove both that Chauvin wrongfully assaulted and killed Floyd and that Chauvin acted based on racial animus. The Justice Department could also charge Chauvin with depriving Floyd of his civil rights. This charge requires proof that a person acting ""under color of law"" -- police officers certainly qualify -- willfully deprived a person of a civil right (here, the right to be free of unreasonable seizure). While racial motive can support this kind of charge, the law does not require prosecutors to prove a racial motive under this statute. Three questions to watch this week: 1) Will Minnesota prosecutors begin to present evidence to a grand jury to indict the ex-officers in the Floyd case? 2) Will prosecutors in Georgia bring charges against the ex-officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta? 3) Will the Court of Appeals grant or deny former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn's motion to take the case away from the district court judge and compel dismissal?

95,Twenty Indian soldiers dead after clash with China along disputed border,"Three Indian soldiers were killed during a ""violent face-off"" with Chinese troops along the countries' de facto border in the Himalayas late Monday, the Indian army said in a statement.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:30:50 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/S9y1eR-jOvo/index.html,"At least 20 Indian soldiers have died after a ""violent face-off"" with Chinese troops along the countries' de facto border in the Himalayas late Monday, the Indian army has said. The incident occurred during a ""deescalation process"" underway in the Galwan Valley in the disputed Aksai Chin-Ladakh area, where a large troop build-up has reportedly been taking place for weeks now on both sides of the border, before senior military commanders began talks earlier this month. The Indian army had earlier said three soldiers had died, but added on Tuesday that a further 17 troops ""who were critically injured in the line of duty at the standoff location and exposed to sub-zero temperatures in the high altitude terrain have succumbed to their injuries."" The deaths are the first military casualties along the two countries' disputed border for more than 40 years. According to the earlier Indian army statement, there was loss of life ""on both sides,"" but it did not specify any number of Chinese casualties. Senior military officials from both sides are currently meeting to defuse the situation, the statement added. ""India and China have been discussing through military and diplomatic channels the de-escalation of the situation in the border area in Eastern Ladakh,"" said India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava on Tuesday. He said senior commanders had ""agreed on a process for such de-escalation"" during a ""productive meeting"" on Saturday, June 6, and ground commanders had met regarding the implementation. ""While it was our expectation that this would unfold smoothly, the Chinese side departed from the consensus to respect the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan Valley,"" he said in the statement. ""Both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side,"" he added. ""Given its responsible approach to border management, India is very clear that all its activities are always within the Indian side of the LAC. We expect the same of the Chinese side. We remain firmly convinced of the need for the maintenance of peace and tranquility in the border areas and the resolution of differences through dialogue. At the same time, we are also strongly committed to ensuring India's sovereignty and territorial integrity."" Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh met with the External Affairs Minister, the Chief of Defense Staff, and the chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force and to review the ""operational situation in Eastern Ladakh"" earlier on Tuesday, the army said. At a regular news conference Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that on Monday, ""Indian troops seriously violated our consensus and twice crossed the border line for illegal activities and provoked and attacked Chinese personnel which lead to serious physical conflict between the two sides."" ""China has lodged strong protest and representation with the India side, and we once again we solemnly ask the India side to follow our consensus and strictly regulate its front line troops and do not cross the line and do not stir up troubles or take unilateral moves that may complicate matters,"" Zhao added. ""We both agreed to resolve this issue through dialogue and consolation and make efforts for easing the situation and upholding peace and tranquility in the border area."" Zhao did not comment on whether there had been any Chinese casualties. China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) released a statement Tuesday night calling on the Indian army to immediately stop what it described as ""provocative actions"" and to ""resolve the issue through the correct track of dialogue and talks."" ""The sovereignty of the Galwan Valley region has always belonged to China,"" Zhang Shuili, the spokesman of the Western Theater said in a statement on China's Ministry of Defense website. ""Indian troops violated its commitment, crossed the borderline for illegal activities and deliberately launched provocative attacks."" Zhang added that the ""serious physical conflict between the two sides"" had ""resulted in casualties."" ""We solemnly ask the India side to strictly regulate its front line troops, immediately stop all infringement and provocative actions, go toward the same direction with China, and return to the correct track of dialogue and talks to resolve differences,"" the statement read. Monday's deaths are the first military casualties along the disputed border for more than four decades, Indian defense experts told CNN. ""We have not had casualties on the Line of Actual Control for at least 45 years,"" said Happymon Jacob, an associate professor and political analyst at New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University. ""This is perhaps a game-changer. This is perhaps the beginning of the end of the rapport that India has enjoyed with China for 45 years."" Former Indian Chief of Army Staff, General Bikram Singh, also confirmed to CNN this is the first such deadly incident in the last 45 years. Tensions have been growing in the Himalayas along one of the world's longest land borders since last month, with New Delhi and Beijing both accusing the other of overstepping the LAC that separates the two nuclear armed neighbors. The territory has long been disputed, erupting into numerous minor conflicts and diplomatic spats since a bloody war between the two countries in 1962. The LAC runs between Chinese-controlled Aksai Chin and the rest of the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region. The rough border line was the result of the India China border dispute in 1962, but neither side agrees exactly where it is or how long it is. Aksai Chin is administered by China as part of Xinjiang, but is also claimed by the Indian government as part of Ladakh. The reported troop build up had left many worried about the potential for a confrontation, particularly as both Chinese and Indian media have published jingoistic calls for action. Both Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have built public support in large part on nationalism and a promise of future greatness. This often translates into aggressive rhetoric, particularly when playing to a domestic audience. Such an approach was evidenced in Chinese coverage of the PLA maneuvers in the Himalayas. Equally, despite Delhi's public calls for easing tensions, leading Indian government figures have struck an aggressive tone, with Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah telling a rally of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) earlier this month that ""any intrusion into the the borders of India will be punished."" ""Some used to say that US and Israel were the only countries which were willing and capable of avenging every drop of the blood of their soldiers,"" Shah said. ""(Modi) has added India to that list.'' Writing for CNN this month, retired Indian general Singh said that part of the problem is that the de facto border, the LAC, is so ill defined. ""At strategic and operational levels, both militaries have exercised restraint,"" he said. ""However, at the tactical level, face-offs occur due to differing perceptions of where the actual border is as the LAC is not delineated on the ground. While face-offs get resolved locally, those related to the building of infrastructure, such as roads and defence fortifications, invariably take longer and require a combination of military and diplomatic initiatives."" Speaking before the most recent clash, former Indian Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao said she hoped the current crisis won't lead to an abandonment of long-standing diplomatic negotiations over the disputed territory. ""Even if tensions rise and tempers fray, they would do well to remember that they have to continue to manage their differences in a grown-up way because armed clashes and military combat can have extremely serious repercussions for the stability of the region going beyond the ambit of the purely bilateral relationship between the two countries,"" she said. CNN's Manveena Suri, Vedika Sud, Shawn Deng, Sugam Pokharel, Isaac Yee and Carly Walsh contributed reporting."
96,Beijing extends residential lockdowns as coronavirus infections spread,"Authorities in Beijing locked down more residential compounds, had more than 30,000 restaurants disinfected and tightened outbound travel as the Chinese capital's latest coronavirus outbreak continued to spread Tuesday, with more than 100 people now infected.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:49:53 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/kQFaoMe4uq0/index.html,"Authorities in Beijing have imposed a soft lockdown on the entire city, after the Chinese capital reported more than 100 new locally transmitted coronavirus cases in the past five days. The city raised its alert level from Level 3 to Level 2 -- the highest alert being Level 1 -- the Beijing government's Deputy Secretary Chen Bei announced in a press conference Tuesday night. The move comes as the city's latest coronavirus outbreak continued to spread Tuesday, with at least 106 new infections since Thursday following an outbreak at Xinfadi, the city's largest wholesale food market. Officials had earlier locked down more residential compounds, ordered more than 30,000 restaurants to be disinfected and tightened outbound travel. All residents living communities deemed medium or high risk, as well as people connected to the Xinfadi market, are banned from leaving the city. The sprawling, bustling market in Beijing's southwestern Fengtai district occupies 277 acres and has more than 2,000 stalls, selling mainly fruit and vegetables as well as meat and seafood. It supplies about 70% of the city's vegetables and 10% of its pork, according to officials. The market has been shut down since Saturday, but its sheer size and the amount of people who work or visit there from in and outside of Beijing have heightened the risk of the outbreak spreading. For the rest of the city's more than 20 million residents, non-essential travel out of town is strongly discouraged, according to the government announcement. Those who must travel need to present a negative result from tests conducted within seven days of departure. The city is reintroducing strict access rules in and out of all local residential communities, and shutting down all schools and recreational venues. Sporting events will also be canceled. Via door-to-door visits and calls, authorities have tracked down nearly 200,000 people who had been to the market during the two weeks prior to its closure. They have been told to stay at home for medical observation and are being tested for the coronavirus, a city official told a news conference on Monday. Residential lockdown Two other Beijing food markets have been shut down due to confirmed cases linked to Xinfadi, leading to strict residential lockdowns in their vicinity. On Tuesday, Xicheng district -- which neighbors Fengtai -- announced that seven residential communities around the Tiantao Honglian market will be locked down following the discovery of a coronavirus case on Sunday. This follows similar lockdowns on residential compounds near Xinfadi and the Yuquandong market in Haidian district. In total, 29 residential communities have been locked down across the city. The residential lockdown measures are similar to the ones imposed earlier in the city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. Wang Du, who lives in one of the communities under lockdown near Yuquandong market, said residents couldn't leave the compound to buy groceries, and had to order food online or buy from a truck that came to the compound once a day with potatoes, fresh vegetables and eggs. She said all residents in her community had nucleic acid tests for the coronavirus yesterday. ""To be honest, I'm not too worried,"" she said. ""I think we have a lot of experience in containment measures, and we're able to react very swiftly (to the new outbreak)."" As of Tuesday morning, 276 agricultural produce markets and 33,173 restaurants across the city had also been disinfected, officials said. Outbound travel restricted The outbreak has also spread beyond Beijing, with the nearby provinces of Liaoning and Hubei reporting a total of eight coronavirus cases linked to the capital clusters. On Tuesday, Sichuan province in the country's southwest also reported a confirmed case -- a woman who returned from Beijing on June 9. She was infected while visiting her husband, who worked at Xinfadi market. Unlike Wuhan, the epicenter of China's original outbreak, Beijing has not completely cut off travel. However outbound taxi and car-hailing services, and some long-distance bus routes between Beijing and neighboring provinces have been suspended, according to the state-run Beijing Daily. Municipal authorities also banned high-risk groups, such as close contacts of confirmed cases, from leaving the city, officials said Monday. On Tuesday, Shanghai announced that travelers from areas with medium-to-high coronavirus risk would be required to be quarantined for 14 days. Beijing had one neighborhood designated as high-risk and 22 as medium-risk as of Monday. CNN's Steven Jiang, Shawn Deng, Philip Wang and Ivan Watson contributed to reporting."

""Our duty is to save lives with the only medication that has been proven clinical evidence to work and which has shown good results in various circumstances in Brazil."" Hydroxychloroquine had been frequently touted by US President Donald Trump, who claimed to be taking it himself as a preventative measure, despite pleas from scientists to let studies decide if the treatment worked or not. Research around the world subsequently cast doubt on its effectiveness, and the FDA ultimately determined that the drugs do not meet ""the statutory criteria"" for emergency use authorization But Pinheiro on Tuesday dismissed the studies cited by the FDA, claiming that the ""quality of their methodology is terrible."" She also said, without presenting any evidence, that coronavirus cases in Brazil had gone down since May 20, when the Health Ministry approved new guidelines allowing the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for all patients displaying mild, moderate and severe Covid-19 symptoms if both doctor and patient agree on the use of the drugs. The Brazilian Society of Pediatrics issued guidance last month, advising hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine only be prescribed to children during controlled clinical trials and with the consent of an adult. There isn't enough data to prove hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine were safe or efficient for children and teens, the group said. The World Health Organization is still reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in its Solidarity Trial, a multi-country clinical study of Covid-19 treatment options. But a trial in the United Kingdom, called the Recovery Trial, recently announced plans to stop using hydroxychloroquine in its study due to there being ""no evidence of benefit,"" according to the researchers. Brazil has suffered the second most-deadly coronavirus outbreak in the world, while its populist leader Jair Bolsonaro has frequently downplayed the severity of Covid-19 and has criticized lockdown measures.

98,Mexico temporarily forbids workers from going to Canada due to coronavirus,Mexico will conduct a safety review of Canadian health policies and procedures before allowing any more temporary workers to travel to Canada to work in the agricultural sector.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:09:45 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RwF1wr8JhiI/index.html,"Mexico will conduct a safety review of Canadian health policies and procedures before allowing any more temporary workers to travel to Canada to work in the agricultural sector. ""This is a temporary pause in order to determine the circumstances surrounding the safety conditions on farms,"" said a Mexican government official with first-hand knowledge of the discussions but who is not authorized to speak on the issue. More than 60,000 migrant workers travel to Canada every year for seasonal work in agricultural industries. A temporary ban means that up to 5,000 Mexican workers are currently waiting to come to Canada. Ambassador Juan Jose Gomez Camacho, on behalf of the Mexican government, has been in daily communication with the Canadian government to try to understand why and how hundreds of Mexican workers have been infected with Covid-19, weeks after completing a mandatory 14-day quarantine in Canada, the official said. CNN has confirmed that two migrant workers from Mexico have died in the last few weeks and dozens more workers have been treated in hospital. Communal housing on farms and cramped conditions in packing facilities and greenhouses has contributed to the virus spread, acknowledged the local health unit in Windsor-Essex, Ontario, where the death occurred. The province of Ontario has been the hardest hit by the outbreaks, and its Premier said Monday no one should blame the migrant workers for getting sick. ""They came here, they self-isolated for two weeks and they picked it up since they've been here,"" said Premier Doug Ford. ""I don't want any finger pointing at these hard-working migrant workers. They're good people, they mean well, and they're hard workers too."" "
99,New York City crime stats show spike in burglaries and murders so far this year,"Murder, burglary and grand larceny auto crimes have spiked in New York City this past month compared to the same period last year, while rape, robbery and grand larceny crimes have declined, according to New York Police Department statistics.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:49:32 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/SZ3onHbXQts/index.html,"Murder, burglary and grand larceny auto crimes have spiked in New York City this past month compared to the same period last year, while rape, robbery and grand larceny crimes have declined, according to New York Police Department statistics. There have been 38 murders over the last 28 days, twice as much as the same period last year, according to NYPD stats as of up to June 14. So far this year, there have been 159 murders, which is 25% higher than last year, the stats show. This year's murder count is on par with New York's murder total five years ago and is well below the elevated murder totals of the decades before that, NYPD data shows. Shooting incidents in 2020 are also up, with 394 happening to date, a 24% increase from the 317 shooting incidents at this point last year. ""The uptick in violence, I haven't seen anything this bad in a long time,"" said a law enforcement official. ""This is the worst I've seen it in six or seven years."" The uptick in murders is tied to gang and drug activity, with drug dealers fighting over territory, another law enforcement official said. This week's crime stats were released as New York's criminal justice system adjusts to three seismic changes: the coronavirus pandemic, the effects of the state's bail reform law, and the mass protests opposed to police brutality and racism against black people spurred by the killing of George Floyd. In addition, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea announced a ""seismic shift"" in its culture Monday by disbanding its plainclothes anti-crime team and reassigning those 600 officers to other roles. ""What we always struggle with, I believe, as police executives, is not keeping crime down. It's keeping crime down and keeping the community with us, and I think those two things, at times, have been at odds,"" Shea said. The coronavirus pandemic and its mass unemployment has hammered state and local tax revenue and is likely to lead to layoffs and spending cuts to New York City's budget. Combined with protesters' calls to ""defund the police,"" the NYPD could see significant decreases in its budget in the coming year. Last week, Mayor Bill de Blasio said he plans to move some funding from the NYPD to youth and social services. A group of city council members has proposed to cut $1 billion from the NYPD's nearly $6 billion budget. The mayor's press secretary says de Blasio ""does not believe a $1 billion cut is the way to maintain safety."" And on Tuesday, de Blasio announced a new policy requiring all body camera footage of incidents to be released in 30 days if a police firearm is discharged or if an officer's Taser or use of force causes death or great bodily harm. Burglaries are up and robberies are down The pandemic and New York's extended lockdown have left storefronts largely closed and caused many residents to flee the city, and the NYPD data shows a responding increase in burglaries and car thefts. Over the last month, burglaries have sharply increased, with 1,691 incidents as compared to 759 the year before. Looting incidents that took place during demonstrations earlier in the month are included in the burglaries figure. For the year, burglaries are up 47% compared to this point last year, from 4,480 to 6,595. Car thefts, known as grand larceny auto, have also increased over 60%, with 3,078 incidents happening this year, up from 1,893 at this point last year. The car theft numbers are part of a national trend as fewer Americans travel and more cars sit idle in driveways and parking garages. At the same time, comparing this past month to the same period last year, criminal complaints of rape are down 33%, complaints of robbery are down 23%, and complaints of grand larceny are down 44%, according to NYPD. Burglary is unlawful entering a building with intent to commit a crime, grand larceny is unlawful theft of higher value items, and robbery is unlawful theft by force or threat of force. Overall, the number of arrests has gone down; there has been a 32% decrease in arrests so far this year as compared to last year. CNN's Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report."
100,University of California votes to restore affirmative action nearly 24 years after it was outlawed,The University of California has voted to restore affirmative action in hopes of diversifying its student body.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:04:15 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/x7JIQ8owHGc/index.html,"The University of California has voted to restore affirmative action in hopes of diversifying its student body. The unanimous decision was reached by the school's Board of Regents on Monday, nearly 24 years after it was outlawed by Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race and gender in admissions in California. By voting, the university endorsed its repeal. The board also voted in favor of an amendment which would repeal Proposition 209 and provisions prohibiting the state from granting favorable treatment to anyone on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or nationality. ""There is amazing momentum for righting the wrongs caused by centuries of systemic racism in our country. The UC Board of Regents' votes to endorse ACA 5 and to repeal Proposition 209 plays a part in that effort,"" board chair John A. Pérez said in a statement. ""As we continue to explore all the University's opportunities for action, I am proud UC endorsed giving California voters the chance to erase a stain, support opportunity and equality, and repeal Proposition 209."" In a news release, the board said Proposition 209 challenged the university's efforts to create and maintain a student body that ""reflects California's laudable cultural, racial, geographic and socioeconomic diversity."" A demand for diversity on college campuses The goal of affirmative action in US colleges and universities is to eliminate discrimination in the admissions process by recruiting and providing incentives for groups, like minority students and women, who have been historically excluded from leadership positions in American society. Affirmative action refers to a set of policies and laws intended to combat that discrimination while promoting diversity in schools and workplaces. Supporters say it levels the playing field, promotes a healthy multicultural society and helps compensate for centuries of racial, social and economic oppression. Detractors argue it's a form of reverse discrimination that favors one group over another based on racial or gender preferences instead of academic achievement. California is one of eight states that have banned race-conscious admissions practices. ""It makes little sense to exclude any consideration of race in admissions when the aim of the University's holistic process is to fully understand and evaluate each applicant through multiple dimensions,"" UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement. ""Proposition 209 has forced California public institutions to try to address racial inequality without factoring in race, even where allowed by federal law. The diversity of our university and higher education institutions across California, should -- and must -- represent the rich diversity of our state."" The state Assembly approved Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5) on Wednesday 60-14. The legislation is now in the state Senate, where it must also pass with a two-thirds vote by June 25. If ratified, ACA 5 will appear on November 3 general election ballot, where it would need a majority vote to pass. In May, the University of  California Board of Regents also unanimously voted to waive ACT and SAT tests as an admissions requirement until 2024 to align their admission policies with ""the broad-based values of the university.""

The entire Roosevelt High School varsity baseball team took a knee as the National Anthem played at its season opener in Des Moines on Monday night. Team members said they did it to support the ongoing protests for social justice and racial equality. Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks are just three of the victims of police brutality this year and protests in their honor continue across the country. As sports resume this summer, people are watching how athletes react to the national outcry when they go onto the field. Athletes have been taking a knee during the National Anthem to stand against police brutality since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the movement in 2016. In this case, it wasn't an MLB or NFL player kneeling that brought attention to a cause. It was a high school team. ""No disrespect to the flag. It's simply to bring attention to the issues at hand, and I think we did the right thing,"" Roosevelt senior Alex Pendergast told CNN affiliate WHO. The team's leadership stands by its players kneeling, Roosevelt High School Activities Manager Tracy Johnson told WHO. ""It made me feel good because our kids are in it together,"" Johnson said. ""We want those kids to be able to express themselves, and it was neat for us to see all of our kids do that."" The National Federation of State High School Associations confirmed to CNN that Iowa was the first state to resume high school sports since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Iowa is the only state that has summer baseball and softball, which explains why they're the first sports to resume. ""Iowa was indeed the first state to resume high school baseball and softball competition, effective yesterday,"" said NFHS Manager of Media Relations Cody Porter. ""Additionally, there were guidelines implemented to practice social distancing between fans, coaches, umpires and administrators."" Iowa Gov.

One of the websites, popular financial blog ZeroHedge, has already been banned from Google's ad platform, while right wing news site The Federalist was served with a warning that it could face a similar ban, Google said. NBC News first reported that both sites were banned and Google later clarified that The Federalist had not yet lost its ability to monetize its content. ""We have strict publisher policies that govern the content ads can run on, which includes comments on the site,"" a Google spokesperson said in a statement. ""If the site remedies the issues with derogatory or offensive comments, they can be reinstated."" Google said in a subsequent tweet that The Federalist had removed its comment section and ""no action will be taken."" ZeroHedge and The Federalist did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Google said some articles on ZeroHedge have also violated its policies in the past, but did not share further information about the content of the articles. The comments on both sites consistently flouted Google's policies against dangerous and derogatory content, the company said. ZeroHedge can appeal the ban if it takes down the offensive content, Google added. The warning issued to The Federalist, in particular, could risk angering some Republicans who have previously criticized tech platforms for what they allege to be an anti-conservative bias -- even as data suggest otherwise.

103,These films explore black lives impacted by white authority,"Following the wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd, many of us have been thinking about the history of race in America, and the ongoing narrative of police violence. We are all looking for resources to help better understand the moment.","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:19:31 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Vq-kx2TlJbA/index.html,"Craigh Barboza teaches film journalism at New York University and writes about race, entertainment and culture. Following the wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd, many of us have been thinking about the history of race in America, and the ongoing narrative of police violence. We are all looking for resources to help better understand the moment. Each of the movies below offers a different perspective on how African Americans have contended with white authority over the decades and centuries. They both speak to and echo what is happening now. The films range from underground classics to big-studio productions, all of which put a human face on timely and difficult social justice issues that have shifted the conversation on racial equality in America in a way that only movies can do. If you've seen the films on this list, you can rewatch them in a new light. And if it's your first time, you might recognize something that resonates with the hundreds of Black Lives Matter and anti-racism  protests that have erupted worldwide calling for wide-reaching reform. ""Harriet"" (2019) Kasi Lemmons' recent biopic portrays the famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman (Cynthia Erivo) as a young, gun-toting heroine prepared to die for the freedom of her people. Starting out in 1849, ""Harriet"" explores the monstrous institution of slavery and how it seeped into American law enforcement in the form of marshals and paid trackers -- sometimes seen as glorified slave catchers. ""What you see in the movie are these armed posses that are after black people,"" said Donald Bogle, the film historian and author of ""Hollywood Black,"" via email. ""There's that sequence on the bridge when Harriet is cornered, after an escape, and she says, 'I'm going to be free or die' and jumps into the river. I think we can draw a connection to what's happening today and a system of pursuers, these violent white men who, in some ways, are sanctioned to murder us."" Erivo's breakout performance as Tubman (she was a double-Oscar nominee last year for best actress and original song) is worth the price of streaming alone. After making it to Philadelphia, she joins the Underground Railroad, where she becomes its most famous conductor. We learn about the prophetic visions that helped her lead approximately 70 enslaved people to freedom, as well as Tubman's command of a black army that freed 150 more in the Combahee River Raid. ""Harriet"" underscores the important role African American women have played in history, and how they continue to suffer discrimination and persecution. ""We've had these instances, like Sandra Bland, who was stopped by the cops for something so minor and, we have it on film -- the way the cop spoke to her and she spoke back -- and she was taken into custody and ended up dead,"" Bogle said. ""There's this idea that this whole system violates African American men but it can do this to African American women as well."" ""Rosewood"" (1997) John Singleton's ""Rosewood"" tells the true story of how, in 1923, a prosperous black town in Florida was burned to the ground. The fuse was lit by a white woman (played by Catherine Kellner) who falsely claimed that she was raped by a black stranger -- a story whipped up to explain the bruises inflicted by her extramarital lover. Throw in some trumped-up talk of a race riot by one of the local officials and it's not long before a group of Klansmen are swarming the town in search of a mysterious black war veteran (played by Ving Rhames). The result is a week-long massacre of torture, shootings and lynchings that Singleton shows in grisly ways on a scale that had never been done before in movies depicting slavery or its legacy. Survivors, many of them children, fled through the nearby swamps. The official death toll was eight, although many believe the final number was much higher. ""'Rosewood' effectively captured the real-life horror of racism,"" said the activist and author Dr. Umar Johnson in an email. ""The lynchings of thousands of African Americans, from the end of slavery in 1865 until the death of Malcolm X in 1965, shows just how inhumane White America can be."" The film is a powerful reminder that black lives, even entire communities, can be destroyed when someone ""weaponizes [their] whiteness,"" as the cultural critic Roxane Gay recently put it in reference to the news last month of a white woman who called the cops on a black birder in New York's Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog, which is the law. (The call was made on the same day that George Floyd was killed.) ""Selma"" (2014) Real change in society has often been the result of a political alliance between inside and outside forces. In addition to a citizen-based movement it's necessary to have government operatives or, even better, leaders like Martin Luther King who can stir the people in power to change laws. As the central figure in ""Selma,"" King (David Oyelowo) is a virtuoso combination of grace, intelligence, rhetorical power and persistence. In an early scene inside the Oval Office, he implores a reluctant President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to push through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, intended to dismantle barriers that had been put in place to stop some black citizens from voting. Without it, he explains, African Americans would not have the same legal rights, but would continue to be murdered by white people, who would  either be protected by white officials or acquitted by all-white juries. ""All white,"" King says, ""because you can't serve on a jury unless you're registered to vote."" Told he'll have to wait, King organizes a massive voting rights demonstration in the South. The scenes in Ava DuVernay's protest drama are played in a stately, but intimate style. The most powerful images are of the scores of activists marching peacefully through the segregated streets of Alabama. ""Ava's film reminds people that no change has ever happened in America without a movement, and struggle, and that it is never easy,"" said writer-activist Kevin Powell, whose new book of essays, ""When We Free The World,"" is out later this month. You can feel what it must have been like to be on the front lines -- along with would-be voters (Oprah Winfrey, LaKeith Stanfield) and future Congressman John Lewis (Stephan James) -- standing up to a horde of state troopers brandishing rifles, electric cattle prods and whips. ""Selma"" went on to win an Oscar for best original song (""Glory"" by Common and John Legend) and is the rare studio movie directed by an African American woman. The film is set around the march on Bloody Sunday in 1965, and the maneuverings and events leading up to it, including the church bombing that killed four little girls in Birmingham, which was a major turning point in the civil rights movement. ""'Selma' is a case study in leadership,"" added Powell. ""It's actually a blessing to have a film to point people to as a teaching tool, to root folks in history, so they understand this is not just for us now, but for those not yet born."" ""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991) Gang violence was visible on the nightly news and MTV when this searing drama about the challenges black men face while growing up in South Central Los Angeles arrived in 1991. ""Boyz N the Hood"" was by no means the first film to tackle the subject. But it had often been done poorly: for instance, when the story is told from the perspective of the cops -- see ""Colors."" (Better yet, don't!) ""Boyz N the Hood,"" on the other hand, was notable not just for its nuanced, insider's perspective of black life on the margins, but for who was behind the camera. John Singleton was fresh out of USC film school when he became part of a new generation of black filmmakers in Hollywood to find success with mainstream audiences. In his semi-autobiographical debut, Singleton used the structure of a coming-of-age tale to show what it's like to live in a world where a trip to the corner store could end in a homicide by shotgun. The film earned him two Oscar nominations, for writing and directing, and also introduced several future stars, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King and Ice Cube, who had recently launched a solo rap career after parting with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. One of the most contemptible characters in ""Boyz N the Hood"" is a black police officer (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson) who responds an hour late to a 9-1-1 call by the main character's father, Furious (Larry Fishburne). ""Homeboy shows up drinking a cup of coffee,"" said director Malcolm Lee, whose movies include ""Undercover Brother"" and the upcoming ""Space Jam: A New Legacy."" ""He feels he's better than hood Negroes because he's in law enforcement, and thinks the world would be better if Furious had killed the intruder,"" Lee said via email. ""He says, 'It'd be one less n**ga out on the streets we'd have to worry about.'"" Years later Furious's college-bound son, Tre (Gooding), is driving home at night when he's stopped by that same officer, who mistakes Tre for a possible gangbanger. Hot-headed and volatile, the cop draws his Smith & Wesson and threatens to blow Tre's head off. We watch as a single tear trickles down Tre's face. In his anguish you can sense the trauma many black people experience after encounters with the police. ""Serpico"" (1973) Last week former President Barack Obama called on local governments in the U.S. to embrace police accountability and said that, in his view, the ""vast majority"" of police officers are not violent. But the fact is that good cops can sometimes find themselves ostracized if they break rank. One of the first films to give us a realistic glimpse into life on the force was ""Serpico,"" with Al Pacino in the title role, an incorruptible detective with a fondness for wild disguises. The fact-based thriller not only turned Pacino into a star when it was released in 1973, it also depicted an out-of-control big-city police department where dirty, racist cops work over perps and take bribes from gamblers and drug dealers. ""Hey, Frank, you want a piece of this?"" asks one cop, who's assaulting a black suspect. ""No, I'm going to fill out the police card,"" Serpico replies. ""'Serpico' is a really powerful depiction of how hard it is to reform policing,"" said Touré, the writer and host of the podcast Touré Show, featuring in-depth interviews with successful black people. ""It shows how much the police will fight against those who demand more from them. The real-life Serpico risked his life to expose wrongdoing."" At first, Serpico is persuaded, then repeatedly pressured, by fellow officers to ""go along,"" before he blows the whistle on graft and corruption in the department. High-ranking city officials reportedly tried to block the investigation, which blew the lid on the documented ""code of silence,"" or blue wall, that many precincts are accused of maintaining. ""The police don't want to be policed!"" said Touré, who believes that it is how you end up with three other officers standing by as Derek Chauvin dug his knee into George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ""It rips at the core of (the police's) culture."" ""Do The Right Thing"" (1989) New York's police force also played a critical part in Spike Lee's infernal of race, class and power in 1980s Brooklyn. Dedicated to the families of several black city residents who have died at the hands of police officers, including Michael Stewart (killed in custody in 1983 after graffitiing a subway wall), and Eleanor Bumpurs (shot twice a year later while being evicted from her public housing apartment), this controversial classic established Lee as a major director and unofficial spokesperson for the African American community. He wrote, starred in and directed ""Do The Right Thing."" The film, which is set up like a play featuring a collage of different voices, tries to show how unchecked racism and xenophobia can fester within a community because of economic inequality and intense social divisions. We get a parade of confrontational scenes between the multi-ethnic cast, which included Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Rosie Perez in her first role, all doing vivid characterizations. The premise is simple: a slice-of-life film set on one block on the hottest day of the year. The climax is a neighborhood riot, triggered by the killing of a black man by the NYPD. The images of Brooklynites clashing with police and vandalizing a storefront look like they could've been ripped from the current protests. The soundtrack is Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power,"" which plays throughout the film. On June 1, Lee, who won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2019 for his film ""BlacKkKlansman,"" posted a short film on Twitter called ""3 Brothers"" (he debuted it on a CNN special report with Don Lemon), that intercuts cameraphone footage of Eric Garner (a police officer was accused of Garner's death after choking him in 2014), and George Floyd, with a scene from ""Do The Right Thing,"" in which Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) dies in a police chokehold. The short starts with the words, ""Will History Stop Repeating Itself?"" ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" (1971) Many of the people who have turned out in droves at recent protests have expressed their anger at police violence -- some have themselves clashed with baton-swinging police or have been tear-gassed or hit by rubber bullets -- and they are ready to take action. That's the kind of story Melvin Van Peebles set out to tell in ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" a scrappy independent film from 1971 that made a then-impressive $10 million at the box office. The tough but silent protagonist here is played by Van Peebles, who also served as writer, director, composer and editor. In sharp contrast to previous black stars like Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte (whose characters were often neutered), Sweetback is a sexual dynamo with the ladies. For the first ten minutes, the film feels flamboyantly risque. Then Sweetback becomes radicalized -- has a full-on political awakening--  after witnessing two white officers brutalizing an innocent black militant. He intervenes, saving the brother, but kills the cops in the process. At that point the film begins to feel like a Molotav cocktail to white authority. ""Van Peebles' film was groundbreaking for its depiction of Sweetback's blatant sexuality, which poses a threat to the system,"" said film and TV producer Stephanie Allain, a longtime advocate for equity and inclusion in Hollywood, and whose credits include ""Dear White People"" and last year's Oscars telecast. ""But his cop killing separates him from society and puts him on the run, probably forever. To me, it's a statement that black male strength is frightening to 'the man.' And it still is."" ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was the first movie to reflect the politics of the Black Arts Movement, one tenet of which is for black people to promote empowering images of themselves in the media. And with its funk-soul soundtrack and shots of the black community aiding Sweetback, as he runs for his freedom, the film also seemed to hint at a grassroots revolution in cinema. It was, and it wasn't. While Van Peebles did introduce a defiant new hero who triumphed over a brutal white power structure, paving the way for the blaxploitation era of the 1970s (which at its unprecedented peak saw more than 40 black-themed movies produced over a two-year span), few films since have matched its cultural resonance. ""Queen & Slim"" (2019) If Sweetback had any offspring they would be ""Queen & Slim."" The title characters in this intriguing drama from 2019 start out at an Ohio diner, where they are on an awkward first date. She (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a black defense attorney; he (Daniel Kaluuya) works at Costco. While heading home their car is arbitrarily pulled over by a racist police officer. A scuffle ensues and they shoot and kill him in self-defense. Shell shocked, they flee the scene. The comparisons to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" are unavoidable. (""Well, if it isn't the black Bonnie and Clyde,"" says one of the characters.) Like that classic about the real-life, white, Depression-era bank robbers, ""Queen & Slim"" has outlaws who fall in love while eluding the authorities and become accidental folk heroes, in this case, because of a viral video of the officer's dashcam footage. But whereas the thrill-seeking and sex-starved antiheroes in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were excited to see their pictures in the paper, Queen and Slim are just the opposite. They are on the lam because of the same police abuse and systemic injustice that have ignited the current protests. By making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be a protective force -- the police -- the filmmakers have created an audacious, lyrical film that should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand the grief and rage of the Black Lives Matter generation. ""Queen & Slim"" was the work of director Melina Matsoukas, a young woman of color on the rise whose stylistic music videos for Beyoncé have mixed documentary and fantasy elements, and ""The Chi"" TV series creator and LGBTQ activist Lena Waithe, who called her original script ""protest art."" The filmmakers said the goal with ""Queen & Slim"" was to realistically portray what it means to be African American today, where you feel the need to regularly contemplate your own mortality, in hopes that you don't become the next hashtag, while following your own path to happiness. One criticism of the movie, however, is that it might be a little too real, or not optimistic enough anyway. ""'Queen & Slim' was very powerful and effectively communicated the psychological and emotional conflicts that exist within the black community toward the police,"" Dr. Umar Johnson said. ""On another level, I feel that the movie did a disservice to the black liberation struggle by not allowing the two protagonists to escape. It reinforced the idea that we can never successfully revolt against the white police power structure."" That may be what the film says, but then, new scripts are being written every day."

Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky.","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 14:33:35 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/iZ6heqZx8Q8/index.html,"Every year, as summer beckons, Pride month arrives in a burst of color. Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky. The multicolored flag has united the LGBTQ community for over 40 years, and though it remains a universal symbol of pride, liberation didn't always come in vibrant technicolor. In fact lavender -- a subtle hue that shifts between light pinkish purples, and gray and blueish tones -- has had, despite its whimsical nature, its own historical significance in representing resistance and power. The making of a color trend Like many aspects of queer culture, it's not surprising that lavender's unique color symbolism often skirts under the radar, especially when it comes to mainstream society. In Western culture it started life as a color of desire, thanks to the lyric genius of 7th century BC poet Sappho, whose papyrus fragments told of her erotic predilections for younger women with ""violet tiaras."" Fast forward a few centuries, and in the 1920s, violets were still drawing together members of the lesbian community, who gifted the delicate flowers as an expression of sapphic interest. It wasn't until the 19th century -- with the accidental invention of a purple synthetic dye -- that the color would become popular in fashion. ""Synthetic dyes ... allowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye."" Towards the end of the 19th century, however, the public began linking lavender with homosexuality. Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and ""art for art's sake."" Newspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his ""purple hours"" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" The fight for visibility The 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a ""dash"" or ""streak"" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln's biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president's early male friendships as containing a ""streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets."" During the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed ""The Lavender Scare"" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality. In 1969, the color came to symbolize empowerment. Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a ""gay power"" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before. It was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a ""Lavender Menace."" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words ""Lavender Menace"" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism. Lavender, however, can't always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest. Throughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender ""napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake."" British filmmaker, artist and author Derek Jarman, meanwhile, nurtured the flower among the ""pharmacopoeia"" of medicinal plants at Prospect Cottage, his fittingly boundary-free oasis in Dungeness, southern England. He also cited violet, mallow (mauve) and lavender among the ""colours of Eden"" missing from God's rainbow in his work ""Chroma: A Book of Colour."" Then, of course, there's Gilbert Baker's rainbow flag, which he lovingly re-worked in 2017 with a lavender stripe to ""represent diversity in the era of Trump."" Living color These days, the color is being worn with confidence, nonchalance and something that feels like defiance; a nod, perhaps, to the radical protest spirit of the '70s. ""Most simplistically, fashion tends to be cyclical, so colors that haven't been in the public eye for a while are often picked up and reinterpreted by designers,"" said St Clair. ""The interlude allows the designers to reinvigorate them: they feel fresh all over again."" The color, St Clair said, has been buoyed by the milestones achieved by the LGBTQ community in recent years, including some country's moves to legalize same-sex marriage, and in the US, gay mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential run and last year's Met Gala theme of ""Camp: Notes on Fashion."" The ""attacks on gay and transgender civil rights by the current administration,"" she added, has also increased the spotlight on the community, encouraging them ""to rally around each other and explore and celebrate identifying symbols that have been important to them in the past."" Perhaps it's why we're seeing the color's resurgence on the spring-summer 2020 catwalks -- in the form of Loewe's 17th century-inspired lace dresses, Max Mara's soft pastel suiting, Valentino's tiered minidresses, and a dress fashioned entirely from chiffon flowers at Marc Jacobs. Or more explicitly celebrated by editor-at-large of American Vogue Hamish Bowles in his flamboyant Maison Margiela Artisanal ensemble at the 2019 Met Gala. If there's one image that shows LGBTQ people that there is a joyous life out there, it's surely Bowles flicking his fringe-lined cape with campish flair. At that same event, Lena Waithe chose a lavender Pyer Moss suit to make a defiant political statement. Amid the sea of glitter and sequins, Waithe stood proud, the stripes of her ensemble stitched with the lyrics of songs sung by Diana Ross and Sylvester, buttoned with the faces of camp pioneers, and emblazoned across the back, a bold message: ""Black Drag Queens Inventend (sic) Camp."" Standing on the steps of a powerful institution, Waithe seemed to herald a new era for the LGBTQ community; one in which people can now live their truth in full color."

No one knows how the pandemic-battered New York will fare in the coming months or years, but Jemisin points to the solidarity and resiliency of the city. ""New York has found ways to come together to make it a safer, healthier, half-happier place. People are looking out for each other,"" she said, from her apartment in Brooklyn. ""And the people who remain will still do what they can to be good New Yorkers, I suspect because there's something about being in the city that pulls that out of a lot of folks."" Jemisin, who was raised by her mother in Alabama but spent summers and holidays in New York with her father, became a full-time resident of the city more than a decade ago, and since then she has become the first author to ever win the Hugo Award for Best Novel (awarded to a science fiction or fantasy book) three years in a row, for her bestselling ""Broken Earth"" trilogy. She is a frequent contributor to The New York Times, and the foremost voice for diversity and inclusion in the world of fantasy writing. Below, Jemisin discusses her latest release and how she turned New York City into a setting for magic and allegory. CNN: How did you come up with the concept for ""The City We Became,"" and specifically, the idea that cities are birthed? In your opinion, is New York alive? NKJ: I travel a lot and I've lived in lots of different places. Whenever you go to a new place, you get a feeling fairly quickly of whether you can be comfortable there, and if the place is welcoming to you and yours. New York has always felt like that to me. And I just thought, well, there must be something to that. If lots of people feel that personality or temperament, then there must be something we're all picking up on. And if there is a personality, there may be life. CNN: In the book, five of the main characters each represent a borough of the city: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. What was your process for distilling the essence of each borough into a character? NKJ: I started with whatever the stereotype of the borough is. And then I tried to understand something about the borough's history. Finally, I wove the characters with my own impressions of the borough. There's a substantial amount of just subjective opinion in there. I'm sure I'm going to hear it from Staten Islanders because my opinion of Staten Island is distinctly noticeable. Brooklyn is 99 percent of what I know of New York, so I decided to make Brooklyn take a back seat because I love it so much. Even as a child, my father lived in Chelsea for a little, but then he moved to Brooklyn Heights. And this is before it was  fancy, expensive Brooklyn Heights. He moved to Williamsburg in the 1980s when it was still a dump, and he still is there today. So I've seen the gentrification wave, and what it does; I was literally at ground zero of the hipster movement. But really, I wanted to de-center my Brooklyn-ness. CNN: You have become one of the most recognized contemporary black writers in the fantasy genre. Can you speak to the importance of including more voices in a genre that has long struggled with diversity? NKJ: I'm not doing anything different than what those old white men with beards living in middle America are doing with their fantasy stories. They're interjecting their white dude ethics and aesthetics into what they write, and I'm doing the same thing with my fiction. The only difference is that our society is configured to see one of those things as perfectly normal, and the other as pathology. Some of the early reviews of ""The City We Became"" criticized the book because it only has one white character. But I'm just doing the same thing that television shows like ""Girls"" do -- I'm just showing New York from my perspective. I've never seen New York as a white place where everybody has really large apartments. If I'm going to write New York, I'm going to write the New York I know, in which artists and queer people and black people and all kinds of people with different ethnic backgrounds are blending and talking to each other and eating each other's food. That is the New York I've always known. Science fiction is about where we're going. But fantasy is about where we've been. If you look at these depictions of medieval Europe in fantasy novels written by middle American white dudes, it's not what the real medieval Europe was like -- art from the same period shows people of color and women in prominent roles. The fantasy we've been getting for the past few decades caters to a particular way of thinking about the world that needs to change -- especially regarding women, whiteness, race in general, and how cultures interact. Fantasy is enhanced by having different voices. But I've always said that black and female and queer writers will know when we have arrived when our work doesn't have to be exceptional. When our mediocre wish fulfillment fantasies get published as often as the white dudes' fantasies get published. CNN: Which authors have you been reading lately and what is it about their work that resonates with you? NKJ: As part of my research for ""The City We Became,"" I read ""The Life and Death of Great American Cities"" by Jane Jacobs. Jacobs was a contemporary of the famous New York city planner Robert Moses, and people just simply didn't listen to her partly because she was a woman. But her perception of how to make safer and healthier cities was rooted in observations of how people actually interact. If Jane Jacobs had had the power to impact the city, the city would be a much healthier place. Read me: an excerpt from ""The City We Became"" Manny's stomach has knotted with fear. He can tell she's about to do something, and he still has no idea how to fight her. ""What do you want?"" he asks, to stall her. To buy time to think. She shakes her head and sighs. ""It would probably be sporting to tell you, but there's no sport in this for me. I just have a job to do. Goodbye, Manhattan."" All at once, she's gone. The Woman in White, that is; between one blink and another, the white woman's clothes and hair flicker back into their ordinary tints. She slumps a little, just an ordinary brown-eyed woman again. But after a moment of confusion, the woman's lips tighten and she raises her cell phone again. The camera light goes back on. But something worse is happening. When the hairs on the back of Manny's neck prickle, he jumps and wheels around, suddenly convinced that someone is coming at him from behind. He sees the forgotten young couple on the lawn, still picnicking, but otherwise there's nothing there— Wait. No. Rising from cracks and spars in the asphalt of the path... are ghostly little white nubs. Manny grabs Bel and yanks him back just as white nubs rise through a crack he'd been standing on. More wriggle through even the unbroken portions of the asphalt. When Manny sees that no white nubs are rising from the narrow ring of bare soil that surrounds the tulip tree rock, and perhaps another three or four inches beyond that, Manny pulls them both to stand within this apparently protected circle. ""What are—"" Bel begins. Bel can clearly perceive the white nubs, Manny is relieved to see. At least he doesn't have to explain this, too. Bel backs himself against the rock, looking around in horror as the nubs become inchworms. ""Just disgusting,"" says the woman. She stands amid an ankle-high lawn of the tendrils now—and the one coming from the back of her neck has fissioned into two, both of them uncannily oriented on Manny. Incredibly, through all this, she's still recording them. Or—not just recording? An instant later a voice crackles from the phone's speaker. Manny can't make it out, but he hears the woman say, ""I need the police. There are these two guys in Inwood Hill Park who are, I don't know, menacing people. I think they're drug dealers, and they won't leave. Also, they're having sex."" ""Listen, woman, I don't think you know what sex looks like—"" Bel splutters. In the distance, the young couple giggles, though Manny doesn't think it's because of what Bel said. They're busy making out and haven't noticed what's happening by the rock. The woman ignores Bel, intent on her conversation. ""Yes. I will. I'm recording them. Right, uh-huh."" She hesitates, then screws up her face and adds, ""African American. Or maybe Hispanic? I can't tell."" ""I'm obviously British Asian, you stupid bint!"" Bel stares at her openmouthed. Meanwhile, however, the tendrils are still growing, and getting long enough that they're going to be able to touch Bel and Manny even if they climb on top of the rock. Which probably isn't going to help, since the rock isn't big enough for two people to stand on. Which reminds Manny that the rock is meaningful. An object of power—somehow. Shorakkopoch, site of the first real estate swindle of the soon-to-be New York. What can he do with that? Oh. Ohhhh. He pushes at Bel. ""Get up on the rock,"" he says. ""I need the room. And give me whatever is in your wallet."" It's a measure of how freaked out Bel is that he complies, scrabbling onto the rock and groping for his back pocket. ""Worst mugging ever, mate,"" he quips with a shaking voice. Manny has pulled his own wallet out of his pocket. He finds himself remarkably calm as he opens it and rummages for something that will serve that tickle of an idea in his mind, and a detached, analytical part of him contemplates this lack of fear. He should be terrified, after seeing what these tendrils have done to another human being. What will it be like to have his body invaded and his mind overtaken by whatever entity these things serve? Like dying, he decides. And since some part of him has faced death before—he's aware of that suddenly; it's why he's so calm—Manny also decides that he's not going out like that. There's not much in his wallet. Some receipts, a five-dollar bill, an Amex card, a debit card, an expired condom. No photos of loved ones, which will strike him as odd only later. An ID—but immediately he tears his eyes away from this, not wanting to see the name he had prior to this morning's train ride. Who he used to be is irrelevant. Right now, he needs to be Manhattan. The instant his fingers touch one of the credit cards, he feels a flicker of that strange energy and focus that he had on FDR. Yes. ""Land has value,"" he murmurs to himself, distracted from the rising, whipping field of white all around him. ""Even public land, like in a park. It's just a concept, land ownership; we don't have to live like this. But this city, in its current form, is built on that concept."" ""Please tell me you aren't losing it,"" Bel says from where he's crouched on the rock. ""I don't think both of us can afford a psychotic break at the same time. We just signed a lease."" Manny looks up at him—and tosses the fiver to the ground, just beyond the rock's ring. He feels rather than hears a sudden, hollow, high-pitched squealing from where the bill has landed, and he knows without looking what has happened. Where the bill has touched the asphalt, it has hurt the tendrils, and caused the ones in that immediate area to withdraw. Bel stares at this. Frantically he pulls a handful of disordered bills out of his wallet. Some of them are euros, some British pounds, US bills, and a few pesos; clearly Bel travels a lot. He tosses one of the pound notes. It lands not far from the bill Manny threw, but nothing happens. ""I told you to give it to me,"" Manny says, snatching the wad of bills from Bel's shaking fingers. Doing this strengthens the strange feeling; Manhattan was built not only on land valuation, but stolen value. ""Just trying to help with this bollocks,"" Bel snaps. ""God, do whatever nonsense you have to do, they're getting closer!"" Manny starts casting the bills around the edge of the field of white, make-it-rain-style. He quickly sees that the money is having an effect, but not much of one. A five-pound note clears the space underneath it, but no more, and he loses sight of it after a moment amid the surrounding field of tendrils. The euros and pounds work, too, but it seems to depend on their value. A hundred-dollar bill clears not only its own space, but an inch or so around itself. A hundred-euro note clears slightly more—but all of it together adds up to only enough space to keep the nearer tendrils from being able to reach Manny. And if the tendrils keep growing, they'll eventually be able to reach Manny no matter how many additional inches of land he's gained. That's it. Suddenly, Manny understands: he is effectively buying the land around the tulip tree rock. But it costs a lot more than sixty guilders now. ""Bel, do you know how much Manhattan real estate runs? Per square foot?"" ""Are you actually insane."" One of the taller tendrils whips toward Manny's thigh, and he swats it with a twenty-dollar bill. It squeals and withdraws. ""I really need to know, please!"" ""How the bloody fuck should I know? I'm a flat renter, not a buyer! Maybe a thousand dollars a foot? Two thousand?"" That's the problem, then, Manny realizes, with a bitter groan. Manhattan real estate is horrifically expensive, and they don't have enough cash to buy their own lives. In desperation, he tosses his Amex, and that has the biggest effect yet, clearing a rectangular chunk of space the size of a sedan. Apparently he's got good credit. Bel doesn't have any cards, however, and there are tendrils beyond the space he's cleared—and now Manny's only got the debit card left. How much money is in his bank account? He can't remember. ""Okay,"" says the woman, with satisfaction. Manny is stunned to realize he forgot her for a moment. She smiles at them from amid the thickest knot of gently waving tentacles, her head and shoulders now festooned with at least a dozen. ""The police say they're on their way. You people might have been able to get away with doing drugs or blowing each other in broad daylight before, but I didn't move here to put up with stuff like that. We're gonna get you out, one by one."" Manny's consternation about Manhattan real estate prices is eclipsed by sudden dry-mouthed fear. If the police do show up—which isn't a guarantee; even as a newcomer, he can tell Inwood is still too brown a neighborhood for a definitive or quick response, especially during a citywide emergency—they will walk right into the rapidly growing field of white tendrils that now surrounds Manny and Bel. And if one tendril has turned a nosy, racist white woman into a conduit for disembodied existential evil, he doesn't want to see what infected NYPD will become. He's getting ready to throw the debit card, and hoping desperately that that account just happens to contain a million dollars or so... when they hear another cell phone. New York, New York, big city of dreams... It's mostly a gabble of tinny sound from this distance. Probably an iPhone. But from the gabble, Manny can make out handclaps over a beat. Electronic drums and... a record scratch? Like in old-school rap? Too much... too many people, too much... Manny whips around to see a middle-toned Black woman coming toward them along a path that converges with the Shorakkopoch clearing. She's tall and strong, with an upright carriage and thighs that are nothing but curve, the latter accentuated further by the pencil skirt she's wearing the hell out of. Some of her bearing comes from all this style, plus smart heels and an elegantly texturized, honey-blond-dyed cap of curls—but most of it's just her. She's a presence. She looks like either a CEO on her way to an incredibly stylish meeting, or a queen who just happens to be missing her court. Then Manny sees that she's also holding up a cell phone. Instead of filming, however, she's using this one to blare music. The song is a little before Manny's time, but he's heard it once or twice, and—ah. With every tinny beat of the synthesized drums, the field of tendrils that has filled the tulip tree rock clearing begins to twitch en masse. As Manny inhales in relief, the woman steps onto the cobbles, and the tendrils flinch away from the brisk click of her heels. The ones she steps on actually scream, in tiny hissing squeaks as they writhe—and then vanish. When she directs the phone downward, the ones that haven't already withdrawn shudder as if each beat is a painful blow. Then they crumble away, leaving no residue or sign that they were ever there. The tendrils are crumbling away everywhere. Too much... too many people, too much... Yes. The city might welcome newcomers like Manny, but mind-controlling parasitic otherworldly entities are the rudest of tourists. ""Five of us,"" Manny murmurs. He knows who, or at least what, this woman is."
106,Vintage photos show British vacationers gone wild,"Butlin's vacation resorts were an institution in post-war Britain. The self-contained camps -- where guests were housed in wooden chalets, fed and entertained on-site -- provided a new kind of inexpensive luxury for working families.","Fri, 22 May 2020 09:48:51 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/rrKm6J-JWZo/index.html,"Butlin's vacation resorts were an institution in post-war Britain. The self-contained camps -- where guests were housed in wooden chalets, fed and entertained on-site -- provided a new kind of inexpensive luxury for working families. At a time when few could afford overseas travel, the resorts offered ""a week's holiday for a week's pay,"" as they were first advertised. Beyond the likelihood of rain, Butlin's summer vacations were a uniquely British proposition. Exuberant in-house entertainers, known as Redcoats, hosted singalongs, pantomimes and rounds of bingo. They held ""glamorous grandmother"" competitions, and ""knobbly knees"" contests to see which guest had the lumpiest legs. Ringo Starr's band (no, not that one) even played residencies there in the early 1960s, before he was invited to join the Beatles. By the time photographer Barry Lewis arrived in the 1980s, however, the camps were ""getting a little bit seedy,"" as he put it. There were fewer families and more singles, with plenty of sex and alcohol mixed in with the entertainment, Lewis said. But the 71-year-old still recalls the resorts' glamorous early reputation. ""When I was a kid, Butlin's was seen as very grand, but my parents could never afford to go,"" he said in a phone interview. ""It was made to sound amazing -- you'd have top stars performing, everything was free and there were fairgrounds."" Launched by Billy Butlin in 1936, the camps' initial popularity was bolstered by the UK government's Holidays with Pay Act, which gave workers the right to paid leave for the first time. A site was opened in Skegness, on Britain's east coast, though more than half a dozen more would be built in British seaside towns over the next three decades. The camps boomed after World War II, welcoming more than a million annual visitors in their mid-1960s heyday. Upon taking a teenage summer job at a Butlin's kitchen in 1966, Lewis found them to be ""enclosed, hermetic worlds"" equipped with theaters, recreation halls, ballrooms, pools, funfairs, boating lakes, hair salons and even churches. ""You were in this enclosed system,"" he recounted. ""You went to this other world. Russia could have invaded America and we wouldn't even have known about it -- there were no TVs in the chalets. ""But there was actually something wonderful about it. You felt you'd joined this weird club. It was very clever in making you feel (as if you were) part of a family."" Warts and all Lewis' teenage experiences hint at the wilder behavior he would later encounter. This ""enclosed fantasy world"" (as the photographer describes it in his new book) was also equipped with bars, discos and betting shops. ""I served breakfasts and learned about becoming a man. I was desperate to fall in love, and all the stuff that goes with leaving home for the first time,"" he said, adding that he often ""served breakfast on a hangover"" after late-night attempts to meet women. ""To be completely frank, I was trying to get laid most of the time."" After going on to university and establishing himself as a professional photographer, Lewis returned to Butlin's in 1982 on assignment for the UK's Observer newspaper. Then aged 34, he was initially astonished at how little had changed. Many of his images are alive with the communality and good cheer he'd remembered -- kids enjoying activities and parents singing and dancing in the entertainment halls. But things, he said, had become more salacious. ""There was a whole sex thing that was never really talked about. A lot of people went there to get laid, so there was quite a lot of sexism,"" Lewis said. ""Alcohol was the drug of choice and people got hammered. Absolutely. ""If you were trying to be part of the gang, you drank with (the Redcoats). They were young lads, but they were adored and they loved that."" The photographer's fondness for the camps is nonetheless apparent (he describes the images as ""warts and all, but in a loving way""). He took an immersive approach to the assignment -- which meant partying and drinking with the other campers. ""That's how we worked,"" he said, referring to the journalist he accompanied, Ian Walker. ""We'd integrate ourselves."" Yet, Lewis also acknowledges there was a certain ""darkness"" to it all. An image from the book shows a Redcoat pinching a female guest's breast. Another shows male judges keeping an uncomfortably close eye on a participant in a ""miss lovely leg"" contest. Elsewhere, an employee is pictured asleep on the lobby floor after a heavy night, while Walker wrote in the Observer at the time that ""two skinheads started smashing up glasses,"" in a resort bar in the early hours. An unlikely renaissance In one of Lewis' most striking photos, he captured a man frozen mid-air just before splashing into an outdoor pool. Huge letters behind spell out one of the camps' slogans: ""Our true intent is all for your delight."" That Billy Butlin might use a quote from ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" speaks of his lofty ambitions for the resorts. But in the 1980s, the glamour was fading. Package trips to Europe had become affordable, dampening the prestige of domestic vacations. Butlin's went into economic decline, and a number of its camps closed in the years that followed. Yet, if the Butlin's of the 1980s differed from that of previous decades, then today's is perhaps less recognizable still. The company has since changed owners and rebranded itself, its resorts fitted with new water parks and subjected to multi-million-dollar expansions. As such, the camps are undergoing something of a renaissance, Lewis ventured. ""I think, now, it's booming again,"" he said. ""With Brexit coming up, and the currency weakened -- and also with Covid-19 -- people aren't going to travel abroad as much. ""There is something nice about not having to think about (your vacation). You just book and that's it, whereas a lot of trips are just full of planning. People like that everything's laid on."" In a statement to CNN, Butlin's said: ""Butlin's has always been a family brand and we've been delighting families for decades. We can't wait until we can reopen our resorts and welcome our guests back to Butlin's for a much needed holiday."" ""Butlin's Holiday Camp 1982,"" published by Hoxton Mini Press, is available now."
107,How laundry is spilling plastics into the ocean,"Off the coast of Cullercoats, in northeast England, researchers Max Kelly and Priscilla Carrillo-Barragan send a long tubular net into the depths of the North Sea.","Mon, 08 Jun 2020 08:08:18 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/dYrvj0iJ570/index.html,"Off the coast of Cullercoats, in northeast England, researchers Max Kelly and Priscilla Carrillo-Barragan send a long tubular net into the depths of the North Sea. Known as a vertical tow, the net is used to collect samples of microscopic zooplankton, whose health can serve as a bellwether for an ocean's overall wellbeing. Newcastle University's Dove Marine Laboratory has been collecting microorganisms from these waters for the last 50 years, shedding light on the impact of changing nutrient levels and global warming. But now experts are studying the samples to examine a growing but almost invisible threat to our seas: plastic microfibers. Microplastics (those measuring up to 5 millimeters in diameter) make up almost a fifth of the 8 million tons of plastic that end up in the oceans each year. Of these, minuscule strands known as microfibers -- which largely come from synthetic clothing -- are the most common, according to Kelly, who researches marine biotechnology at the university. ""A lot of our work is focused on polyester, and polyester is the most widely used synthetic fiber in the textile industry,"" he says. ""So we're ... looking at (what happens) when we wash clothes, what polyester fibers come off and wash down the drain pipes into the ocean where they can be ingested by a wide range by animals."" Every time we do our laundry, our clothes shed millions of microfibers. Although wastewater treatment plants are able to catch as much as 99% of them, the rest can eventually flow into rivers, waterways and, ultimately, the ocean. ""You go from washing machine into environment pretty easily,"" Kelly adds. Invisible threat With Monday marking World Oceans Day, much attention will be paid to the impact of plastic bags, bottles and discarded fishing nets on marine life. But while these pollutants pose serious threats to larger animals, it's microplastics that disrupt life at the very bottom of the food chain. According to Carrillo-Barragan, a research associate at Dove Marine Laboratory, the fibers have an immediate impact on the microorganisms themselves, on aspects such as feeding behavior, reproduction and larval development. This could, in turn, affect the health of the whole marine ecosystem. ""It's been reported that instead of eating what they need, (microorganisms) are eating plastic so they don't get the nutrients they need,"" she explains. ""And then, what the studies mention, is they don't develop as they should. ""If you think of these (microorganisms) being at the base of the food web, then ... they are food for other bigger species, and then they are not getting the nutrients they need. So it is, overall, a less nutritious cycle."" There are fears that these plastic particles may eventually end up on our dinner tables. And while there are still many unanswered questions about bioaccumulation -- a process whereby potentially toxic particles make their way up the food chain -- Carrillo-Barragan sees worrying signs in the nascent research. ""It's an early science,"" she says. ""We are just starting to do experiments on the possible effects that (microplastics) might have in all levels of life -- including us. ""We don't know exactly what is going to happen, or what will be the consequences. But we can tell that just by the abundance of (microfibers in the ocean) ... that there might be something."" Fast fashion's impact At the root of the problem is a global textile industry that Kelly says produces more than 40 million tons of synthetic fabrics a year. The vast majority of this is polyester clothing, he explains, while acknowledging the material's many benefits. ""It's a great material to make clothing,"" he concedes. ""It's very breathable. It is used a lot for sports and outdoor activity. They dry really well and it's a cheap material as well. It is very durable and lightweight. ""So it is ideal in terms of clothing. However ... that durability makes it very difficult to degrade."" The British researcher has been working with multinational corporation Procter & Gamble, which makes detergents among much else, to investigate how individuals' laundry habits may impact the number of microfibers released per wash. Their studies have found that delicate wash cycles can produce 800,000 more microfibers than regular ones. Neil Lant, a research fellow at the American firm, says that cold, quick wash cycles can help people reduce their plastic footprint. He also recommends only running full loads and using a high-efficiency washing machine. The use of chemical detergents, fabric softener and stain removers, as well as the synthetic dyes released from clothes during washing, can all have a negative impact on the environment. But cutting down the amount of new clothing we buy may, in addition reducing textile waste, have the added benefit of lessening microfiber pollution. ""We found new clothing, was shedding much more fiber than older fabrics,"" Lance says. ""And we did testing of 60 washes to confirm this. That's really important because it's telling consumers another way that they can slow down fiber loss, and to significantly reduce the amount of fibers (released), is to buy less new clothing. ""It'll help people financially and it'll also be great for the environment. So we think everyone's a winner. But it does involve a culture change for sure."" Kelly adds, ""People should care because we've all got to play our part. (If) we play our part, it's going to equate to a big overall positive impact on the ocean.""

108,Inside 'American Horror Story' creator's LA and NYC homes,"Writer and director Ryan Murphy was 8 years old when his parents first let him decorate his room.

""I decided to buck the bland and go bold: olive-green walls, chocolate-brown shag carpeting -- and a gold disco ball,"" he recalled in the latest issue of Architectural Digest, as he opened the doors to his quietly luxurious LA and New York homes. The creator of ""American Horror Story,"" the high school musical series ""Glee"" and successful dramas including ""Nip/Tuck,"" ""Pose"" and ""Hollywood,"" has offered a rare glimpse inside the houses he shares with husband David Miller and their two sons. While Murphy described his TV shows as ""colorful and baroque,"" his approach to home design has become comparatively understated. Writing in the magazine's June issue, he traces a preference for toned-down interiors to around 2012, when his career started taking off and the couple's first son, Logan, was born. ""It suddenly dawned on me that I wanted to live with less: less color, less clutter, fewer things. An edited life,"" Murphy wrote. In other words, he wanted to live in ""a monastery,"" as he told a friend who had called to inform him about a dilapidated property he had found in LA. The house ""was a wreck,"" continued Murphy, who said it even included a ""fake-turf putting green"" in the backyard. But the screenwriter nonetheless saw potential in the high ceilings and vast rooms. To help realize his vision, Murphy and Miller enlisted the help of interior designers Pamela Shamshiri and the Diane Keaton-approved Stephen Shadley, to facilitate a new pared-down approach. ""Out of that process came three rules of what I call 'minimalist luxury'"" Murphy said, naming his golden rules as: ""Repeat, repeat, repeat"" (choosing three main materials and using them over and again), ""make it big"" (creating a regal and de-cluttered feel with grandiose objects) and ""don't use color."" Today, the family's stunning LA home features muted white chalk plaster walls (which, Murphy points out, were popular in Spanish monasteries), an outdoor swimming pool lined with olive trees and an al fresco bathtub, as well as sculptures by François-Xavier Lalanne and the Haas Brothers. Photos in Architectural Digest also show furniture by renowned designers including Joaquim Tenreiro, Rick Owns and Axel Einar. Heading out east While in the middle of renovating his California dream home, Murphy got a call about another house in New York, where he'd always dreamed of living. It, too, had the monastic feel he was looking for. ""It was exactly the same vibe we were going for in Los Angeles, only... done!"" he wrote. ""No fireplaces to redo and obsess over. Everything was warmth and wood and air."" Like the family's other residence, Murphy and Miller's New York property is minimalist but far from bland. This time aided by designer David Cafiero and art consultant Joe Sheftel, the couple incorporated their sons' Swedish heritage into the interiors, while adding grand touches like a weighty stone soaking tub. Murphy said they also ""specifically sought out pieces from artists taken too soon by the AIDS plague,"" decorating the home with works by the likes of Hugh Steers, Robert Mapplethorpe and David Wojnarowicz. But while the family has spent the past year in monochromatic luxury, more color may be on the way as the couple prepare to welcome their third child. ""I feel an attack of color and Legos and bright Magna-Tiles coming on,"" Murphy wrote. ""We are expecting another baby, a boy, in August."""
