0,John Bolton: Trump sought Xi's help with re-election,Details from the new book by the president's ex-national security adviser include damning accusations.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:45:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53086042,"US President Donald Trump tried to get China's Xi Jinping to help him secure re-election, ex-National Security Adviser John Bolton's new book says. In details of the forthcoming book in US media, Mr Bolton says Mr Trump wanted China to buy agricultural produce from US farmers. Correspondents say the episode is reminiscent of actions that led to Mr Trump's impeachment. The Trump administration is trying to prevent publication of the book. According to the Department of Justice complaint, it contains ""classified information"". The book, entitled The Room Where It Happened, is due to be released on 23 June. In January, the White House said it contained ""top secret"" details, which must be removed, although Mr Bolton rejected this. Mr Bolton also addresses the claims that formed a central part of the president's impeachment trial. In January, President Trump was impeached for withholding military aid to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into starting a corruption investigation into Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and his son Hunter. The president denied the reports and Mr Trump was acquitted after a two-week trial in the Republican-controlled Senate, which did not include any witnesses. Mr Bolton says the inquiry might have had a different outcome if it had gone beyond Ukraine and investigated other instances of political interference. Mr Bolton joined the White House in April 2018 and left in September the following year, saying he had decided to quit as national security adviser. President Trump, however, said he had fired Mr Bolton because he disagreed ""strongly"" with him. On one hand, the account John Bolton offers in his new book should seem somewhat familiar. This is hardly the first time a former adviser or anonymous current aide to Donald Trump has offered anecdotes about a president seemingly uninterested in the details of governing and uninformed on basic issues of foreign policy. For nearly three-and-a-half years, there have been plentiful stories about a White House rife with backbiting and internal power struggles. Mr Bolton's book goes beyond this well-trodden ground, however, in painting a broad portrait of a president willing to bend foreign policy to advance his domestic and personal political agenda. This was the heart of the impeachment case congressional Democrats made against Trump in January. Mr Bolton confirms their allegations that the president wanted the withholding of military aid to pressure Ukraine to provide damaging information about Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Bolton adds that Trump's dealings with China were also done with an eye on his re-election, and that he repeatedly intervened to assist friendly autocrats around the world. Republicans suggest this is all the work of a disgruntled employee trying to sell books, while Democrats are already growling that Bolton should have volunteered these bombshells during the impeachment proceedings. That ship has sailed, of course, but Bolton's book can still have a bite, distracting a presidential campaign struggling to find its footing less than five months before election day. The allegations refer to a meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan in June last year. The Chinese president had complained that some US critics of China were calling for a new cold war, Mr Bolton said in an extract from the book published in the New York Times. He said Mr Trump assumed Mr Xi was referring to his Democratic opponents. ""Trump, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election [in 2020], alluding to China's economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he'd win,"" Mr Bolton said. ""He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome."" When Mr Xi agreed to make discussions on farm products a priority in trade talks, Mr Trump called him ""the greatest leader in Chinese history"". Speaking on Wednesday evening, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer disputed Mr Bolton's account, saying the request for help with re-election ""never happened"". Mr Bolton also mentions an earlier conversation at the summit's opening dinner, in which they discuss the building of camps in China's western Xinjiang region. Mr Trump said the construction should go ahead as it was ""the right thing to do"". Human rights groups have strongly criticised China over the camps, where about a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities have been detained for punishment and indoctrination. Mr Trump's closest advisers, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Mr Bolton himself, considered resigning in disgust or frustration, the former aide said. ""He second-guessed people's motives, saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government,"" Mr Bolton added. He includes details of a number of private conversations. Among other things, Mr Trump is alleged to have been unaware that the UK was a nuclear power or that Finland was a country. On one occasion, Mr Bolton writes, the president said he would threaten to withdraw from Nato if allies in the bloc failed to increase defence spending. And he remarked that Mr Pompeo - generally considered loyal to Mr Trump - once complained he was having a ""cardiac arrest"" during a presidential phone call with the South Korean leader."
1,Oxford college wants to remove Rhodes statue,Oriel College's governors vote to take down the statue of the Victorian colonialist Cecil Rhodes.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 22:18:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-53082545,"Oriel College in Oxford has announced that it wants to take down the controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes. The governors of the Oxford University college voted on Wednesday to remove the statue of the colonialist. Campaigners have called for the statue to be taken down - saying it was a symbol of imperialism and racism. The removal is not expected to be immediate - as the college says there will need to be consultations over planning regulations. The Rhodes Must Fall campaigners said the announcement was ""hopeful"", but warned they would remain cautious until the college had actually carried out the removal. In a statement, campaigners said that until the ""Rhodes statue ceases to adorn the facade of Oriel College on Oxford's High Street"" there would still be protests over ""imperial and colonial iconography"" in university buildings. Oriel College's governors said the decision had been reached ""after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection"" - and in ""full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world"". The college is to launch an ""independent commission of inquiry"" into the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, which also includes scholarships at the university. The commission, to be headed by Carole Souter, will also consider wider issues, such as support for black and ethnic minority students and a commitment to ""diversity"" - and will consult with groups including students, local people, councillors and the Rhodes Must Fall campaigners. Susan Brown, leader of Oxford City Council, backed the decision to take down the statue - and said the college's inquiry would be a chance to decide where the statue will ""best be curated in future"". The fate of the statue has divided opinion. Earlier on Wednesday the universities minister had spoken against calls to remove the statue. Michelle Donelan said it would be ""short sighted"" to try to ""rewrite our history"" - and rejected attempts to ""censor or edit"" the past. ""I want to be really clear that racism is abhorrent and shouldn't be tolerated anywhere in our society, and that includes universities,"" she told a Higher Education Policy Institute event. Ms Donelan said she was opposed to the renaming of buildings named after the 19th Century statesman, William Gladstone, or the removal of the Rhodes statue. Protesters on the streets of Oxford have called for the statue to be taken down, saying that it represented imperialist values that were no longer acceptable. But last week the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Louise Richardson, gave little support for removing the statue - and warned against ""hiding"" the past. ""My own view on this is that hiding our history is not the route to enlightenment,"" Prof Richardson told the BBC. ""We need to understand this history and understand the context in which it was made and why it was that people believed then as they did,"" she said. ""This university has been around for 900 years. For 800 of those years the people who ran the university didn't think women were worthy of an education. Should we denounce those people? ""Personally, no - I think they were wrong, but they have to be judged by the context of their time,"" said Prof Richardson."
2,Rayshard Brooks shooting: US policeman faces murder charge,"Rayshard Brooks, a black man, was shot twice in the back as he fled police in a car park in Atlanta.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:53:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53084232,"A police officer who fatally shot a fleeing black man in the back last week in Atlanta, Georgia, will be charged with murder and assault, officials say. Garrett Rolfe, who has already been fired, faces 11 charges related to Rayshard Brooks' death. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. The other officer who was at the scene, Devin Brosnan, plans to testify as a witness in the case, officials said. The case comes amid US protests over police killings of black Americans. Lawmakers in Washington are currently debating new police reform laws. Officer Brosnan -  who has already been placed on administrative leave - will be charged with assault for standing on Mr Brooks' shoulder as he lay dying. Officials said this was the ninth time that an Atlanta police officer had been prosecuted for homicide. They added that it is believed to be the first time a police officer would testify against a member of his own unit. Mr Brooks failed a field sobriety test on 12 June after he was found asleep inside his car that was blocking a drive-through lane at a Wendy's restaurant. After pulling over his vehicle, the father-of-four appeared ""slightly impaired, but his behaviour during this incident was almost jovial"", Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said on Wednesday. For over 40 minutes, video shows him complying with officers as he consented to a weapons search and provided them with his identification details. However, as officers tried to handcuff him, he began struggling. The footage appears to show Mr Brooks punched Mr Rolfe, grabbed Mr Brosnan's stun gun and turned back while fleeing to fire it at Mr Rolfe. Mr Brooks suffered two gunshots to the back that caused organ injuries and blood loss. One police bullet also hit a witness' vehicle, nearly killing the driver, investigators say. Prosecutors said Mr Rolfe said: ""I got him."" For over two minutes after Mr Brooks was shot, neither officer provided medical attention as police are required to do, prosecutors said. Instead, Mr Rolfe kicked Mr Brooks while he was on the ground, and Officer Brosnan stood on Mr Brooks' shoulder immediately after the shooting, Mr Howard added. The district attorney said that eight videos from the scene showed Mr Brooks ""displayed no aggressive behaviour during the 41 minutes and 17 seconds"" that he was questioned, and posed no physical risk to the officers in that time. Mr Brooks was 18ft (5.5m) from the officers when he was shot twice in the back, investigators say. ""I believe that at the time of the shooting, Mr Brooks did not represent a threat,"" Mr Howard said, noting that police rules prohibit firing a Taser at a fleeing suspect. ""So he certainly cannot fire a handgun at someone running away,"" he said. A lawyer for Mr Rolfe blamed Mr Brooks for his choice to ""violently attack"" the arresting officers ""suddenly, without warning or provocation"". ""Mr Brooks violently attacked two officers and disarmed one of them,"" continued the statement issued by the LoRusso Law Firm. ""When Mr Brooks turned and pointed an object at Officer Rolfe, any officer would have reasonably believed that he intended to disarm, disable, or seriously injure him."" A lawyer for Mr Brosnan disputed the district attorney's claim that he will serve as a ""state's witness"", or that he has already admitted to standing on Mr Brooks as he died. ""It's absolutely untrue,"" lawyer Don Samuel told the Atlanta Journal Constitution newspaper. ""The decision to initiate charges by the Fulton County DA's office is irrational, unethical and obviously based on factors which should have nothing to do with the proper administration of justice,"" he said in a statement. The newspaper added that the prosecutor faces re-election in August. The shooting came amid nationwide unrest over the death in police custody of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The four officers involved in Mr Floyd's arrest have been sacked and are facing charges of second-degree murder, or aiding and abetting murder. The Wendy's restaurant where Mr Brooks died was burned by arsonists after about 1,000 protesters turned up there in the hours after his death. His death also led to the resignation of Atlanta's chief of police. A lawyer for Mr Brooks' widow, Tomika Miller, told the Associated Press that there were not aware of some of the details announced on Wednesday, such as Mr Rolfe's alleged kick as Mr Brooks lay dying. ""It's heartbreaking, but it's an attempt to redefine justice,"" said lawyer L Chris Stewart. Why this case is different Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC News The swiftness with which a white police officer has been fired and then charged with murder in the killing of Rayshard Brooks is just the latest sign of how rapidly and dramatically police agencies have shifted strategy when it comes to dealing with deadly force cases. Historically, not only have police chiefs been reticent to take action against officers involved in in-custody deaths until a ""full investigation"" had taken place, they've been quick to defend the officer's use of force if he or she ""reasonably"" believed that a person had a deadly weapon or posed immediate danger to the officer. In this case, video shows that Brooks had taken the officer's Taser and appears to use it. But not only is the weapon designated as less than lethal, the video shows he was running away and that the shots that killed him entered his back. Now the officer faces 11 charges, the question of whether or not a Taser should be considered a deadly weapon will surely come into play, as well as whether the officer had ""reasonable"" fear of Brooks. What is already clear is that police departments are not feeling nearly as confident relying on the old strategies and rhetoric that historically have allowed them to slow-play their response to a police-involved killing."
3,Coronavirus: Health minister says app should roll out by winter,"Lord Bethell says the coronavirus-tracing app is ""not a priority"" and has no firm launch date.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:42:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53083340,"A government minister has said the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app is ""not a priority"" and he was not sure it would be out by winter. The app, which has been trialled on the Isle of Wight, was initially expected to launch nationally weeks ago. The BBC can also reveal that the project's two lead managers - NHSX's Matthew Gould and Geraint Lewis - are stepping back. And Simon Thompson - a former Apple executive - is joining to manage it. Mr Thompson is currently chief product officer at the online grocer Ocado. He has been appointed to Baroness Dido Harding's Test and Trace team, where he will have other duties in addition to the app. Mr Gould and Mr Lewis had always expected to move back to their other duties this month, however they had intended for the app to have had its national rollout by now. Lord Bethell, the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, said he was unable to give a date for its launch. But he insisted that the trial ""has gone very well indeed"". He was responding to questions at the Science and Technology Committee on Wednesday afternoon. ""We are seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn't the priority for us at the moment,"" Lord Bethell said in answer to a question about the app. He admitted that was ""an expectation of management answer, saying I can't give you a date"". Lord Bethell said it was still the government's intention to launch it at some point. Lord Bethell has just poured a bucket of icy water over the project that was supposed to be at the heart of the government's test-and-trace strategy. At the beginning of May, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people had a duty to download the app, which was expected to be rolled out nationally by the end of the month. Plenty of people warned at an early stage that telling people via an app notification to go into quarantine might not work. Now it seems the Isle of Wight trial has confirmed that most prefer the more human touch of a phone call. The team behind the app have an updated version ready to go which they feel addresses many of the concerns. But it looks as though ministers and the Test-and-Trace supremo Baroness Harding have decided to put the whole idea in the deep freeze. Don't bet on it coming back in the winter. He also added that the trial on the Isle of Wight had shown that some people preferred humans to do the contact tracing. ""There is a danger of it being too technological and relying too much on text and emails, and alienating or freaking out people - because you're peddling quite alarming news through quite casual communication,"" he said. Since the launch of the trial phase six weeks ago, there have been few official updates about any expected timeline, and reports that ministers are considering switching systems. In other app developments: Lord Bethell said that because the disease's prevalence was currently relatively low, ""we're not feeling under great time pressure, and therefore we're focusing on getting the right app"". He added: ""I won't hide from you that there are technical challenges with getting the app right, and we are really keen to make sure that we get all aspects of it correct."" He also acknowledged that the public were highly concerned about the app, which he said was one reason an app had not been ""rushed"" out. ""If we didn't quite get it right the first time round, we might poison the pool and close down a really important option for the future."""
4,Coronavirus: Matt Hancock's social distancing slip-up caught on camera,"The health secretary slaps a colleague on the back in the House of Commons, despite the two-metre rule.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:31:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53079006,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been spotted slapping a colleague on the back in the House of Commons, despite social distancing measures in place to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mr Hancock's moment of apparent forgetfulness happened as he arrived to Prime Minister's Questions. He and other ministers have repeatedly urged the importance of people keeping two metres away from one another. Mr Hancock said he was ""so sorry for a human mistake on my part"". ""Like all of us, I instinctively wanted to reach out to a friend I'd just seen - in this case, for the first time in many weeks. I realised my mistake and corrected myself,"" the health secretary said. He said it shows how hard social distancing can be, but added it is ""so important that we all keep trying to do our bit"". In a clip which quickly garnered thousands of views after it was posted on Twitter, the health secretary can be seen putting his arm across a colleague's shoulder as he enters the Commons. A third MP then comes and stands beside both of them, before the man in the middle steps back. Mr Hancock then steps across to fill the gap to speak to the third MP, before moving back again. Mr Hancock announced he had tested positive for coronavirus in March - shortly after Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed his own positive test. While Mr Johnson had to spend several days in intensive care, Mr Hancock had mild symptoms. Scientists have said it is likely that people who have already had the virus will have some immunity to it, but that everyone must still stick to social distancing rules. The World Health Organization said in May that there was ""currently no evidence"" that people who have recovered from the virus are protected from a second infection. Speaking in the Commons after the slip-up, Mr Hancock defended why the government has not yet reduced social distancing from two metres to one metre - something many businesses have said will be crucial to their recovery as they reopen. ""It's the sort of thing of course we want to lift and we need to do that in a way that is careful and safe,"" Mr Hancock said. ""The scientists are reviewing it, along with the economists, and we will take forward the further measures on this when it's possible and safe to do so."" A review into the two-metre rule will be completed ""in the coming weeks"", No 10 said on Monday. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines suggest a one-metre distance sufficiently reduces the spread of the virus. But the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre away from others carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart."
5,Dark matter hunt yields unexplained signal,The Xenon 1T experiment may have found signs of a previously undetected dark matter particle.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:59:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53085260,"An experiment searching for signs of elusive dark matter has detected an unexplained signal. Scientists working on the Xenon 1T experiment have detected more activity within their detector than they would otherwise expect. This ""excess of events"" caused by outside particles could point to the existence of a previously undetected dark matter particle called an axion. Dark matter comprises 85% of matter in the cosmos, but its nature is unknown. Whatever it is, it does not reflect or emit detectable light, hence the name. There are three potential explanations for the new signal from the Xenon1T experiment. Two require new physics to explain, while one of them is consistent with a hypothesised dark matter particle called a solar axion. So far, scientists have only observed indirect evidence of dark matter. A definitive, direct detection of dark matter particles has yet to be made. There are several theories to account for what that particle might be like. The most favoured one has been the WIMP, or Weakly Interacting Massive Particle. Physicists working on the Xenon series of experiments have spent more than a decade hunting for signs of these WIMPs. But the search has been fruitless. But Xenon1T, the most recent iteration was also sensitive to other candidate particles. The experiment was operated deep underground at the Gran Sasso facility in Italy, from 2016 to 2018. Its detector was filled with 3.2 tonnes of ultra-pure liquefied xenon, two tonnes of which served as a ""target"" for interactions between the xenon atoms and other particles that were passing through. When a particle crosses the target, it can generate tiny flashes of light and free electrons from a xenon atom. Most of these interactions - also known as events - are with particles we already know about, such as muons, cosmic rays and neutrinos. This constitutes what scientists refer to as the background signal. A potential signal from an undiscovered particle needs to be strong enough to rise above this background noise. Scientists carefully estimated the number of background events in Xenon1T. They expected to see roughly 232, but the experiment instead saw 285 - an excess of 53 events. One explanation could be a new, previously unconsidered source of background contamination, caused by the presence of tiny amounts of tritium in the Xenon1T detector. It could also be due to neutrinos, trillions of which pass through your body, unhindered, every second. One explanation could be that the magnetic moment (a property of all particles) of neutrinos is larger than its value in the Standard Model, which categorises the elementary particles in physics. This would be a strong hint that some other new physics is needed to explain it. However, the excess is most consistent with a signal from solar axions, a very light as-yet undetected particle, which is also a dark matter candidate. In statistical terms, the solar axion hypothesis has a significance of 3.5 sigma, meaning that there is about a 2/10,000 chance that the observed excess is due to a random fluctuation rather than a signal. While this significance is fairly high, it is not large enough to conclude that axions exist. The significance of both the tritium and neutrino magnetic moment hypotheses corresponds to 3.2 sigma, meaning that they are also consistent with the data. Scientists working on the Xenon collaboration are currently upgrading to a different iteration called XENONnT. With better data from this future version, they are confident they will soon find out whether the excess is a statistical fluke, a background contaminant, or something far more exciting.

8,PM to welcome Macron for Resistance anniversary,Four French Resistance fighters will also be awarded honorary MBEs for their role in World War Two.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:31:23 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53085443,"Four French Resistance fighters will be awarded honorary MBEs for their role in World War Two as Boris Johnson welcomes Emmanuel Macron to Downing Street. The French president is visiting London on Thursday to commemorate the 80th anniversary of wartime leader Charles de Gaulle's BBC broadcast to occupied France after the 1940 Nazi invasion. The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall will also meet Mr Macron. Mr Johnson paid tribute to the ""courage and sacrifice"" of the fighters. The four men - Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100, Daniel Bouyjou-Cordier, 99, Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98 - are surviving members of the Order of Liberation, an honour given by France to those who played an outstanding role in setting France free. Their MBEs will be presented at a ceremony in France in the coming months. In Downing Street, Mr Johnson and Mr Macron will view artefacts and letters from General de Gaulle's time in London and from his partnership with the UK's wartime prime minister, Sir Winston Churchill. After the fall of France, General de Gaulle made a speech from London on 18 June 1940. Known as the ""Appel"", or appeal, it rallied the country in support of the Resistance. The prime minister and president will also hold talks on the pandemic and other issues, with Mr Johnson having said he would raise travel between the UK and France at the meeting. Mr Macron was exempt from the UK's 14-day quarantine requirements, as a ""representative of a foreign country on business"". By Gavin Stamp, BBC News It was 80 years ago that General Charles de Gaulle broadcast a historic message from London to his fellow countrymen imploring them not to give up the fight against Hitler. France was on its knees at the time, German troops having entered Paris four days earlier, and on the verge of agreeing an armistice confirming its formal military surrender. In the message, broadcast in French, De Gaulle said in French ""whatever happens the flame of the French resistance must not be extinguished and will not be extinguished"". Transmitted on the BBC's French Service, the broadcast was not recorded and relatively few people in France heard it. But a similar broadcast four days later on the same network reached a wider audience and went a long way to establishing de Gaulle as his country's leader in-exile. The 18th June 1940 remains one of the most important dates in UK-French history and still has enormous resonance on both sides of the channel. The anniversary of the Appel will be marked with a flypast of the Red Arrows and their French counterparts, La Patrouille de France. Mr Johnson said General de Gaulle arrived in the UK 80 years ago knowing that Britain and France's shared values of ""freedom, tolerance and democracy"" were under threat and pledging to defend them. The Resistance fighters being honoured ""symbolise the enduring depth and strength of friendship"" between the countries, he said. Mr Johnson called them ""heroes"" and paid tribute to their ""courage and sacrifice in defending us and the whole world from fascism"". ""The struggles we face today are different to those we confronted together 80 years ago. But I have no doubt that - working side by side - the UK and France will continue to rise to every new challenge and seize every opportunity that lies ahead,"" he said. At Clarence House, home to the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall, Mr Macron will be welcomed by a ceremonial guard of honour from the Coldstream Guards, along with music by the Band of the Coldstream Guards."
9,George Carey: Former archbishop suspended over abuse inquiry,George Carey's permission to officiate is revoked amid an inquiry in abuse committed by a barrister.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:46:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-53086234,"Former Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey,  has had his permission to officiate as a priest revoked. The Church of England said new evidence linking Lord Carey, 84, to a review into allegations of abuse against the late John Smyth, had emerged. There is no allegation of abuse against him. Barrister Mr Smyth QC, who died aged 77 last year, was accused of attacking boys whom he had met at a Christian camp in Dorset in the 1970s and 1980s. The independent inquiry was launched into the Church's handling of allegations against the Mr Smyth. Permission to Officiate (PTO) is required for any Church of England priest to preach or minister. Lord Carey previously had his PTO revoked after a damning independent report found he had ""colluded [with the convicted abuser Peter Ball] rather than seeking to help those harmed"". He resigned from his post as an assistant bishop in the Diocese of Oxford in 2017. He was later granted a PTO by the diocese in 2018, allowing him to preach at the church where he worships, conditional on no further concerns coming to light. A spokesman for the diocese said: ""A planned independent review into the Church of England's handling of allegations against the late John Smyth QC is currently under way. ""In the course of that review, new information has come to light regarding Lord Carey, which has been passed to the National Safeguarding Team for immediate attention as per the agreed terms of reference set for the review."" Lord Carey's PTO has been withdrawn while the matter is being investigated and he is unauthorised to ""undertake any form of ministry in the Diocese until further notice."" The spokesman added: ""However, for the avoidance of doubt, we wish to make clear that the new information received relates only to the review currently underway, and that there has not been an allegation of abuse made against Lord Carey."""
10,Sturgeon condemns 'racist thugs' after Glasgow protests,The first minister criticises disorder in Glasgow's George Square as six men are arrested.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:32:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53086488,"Nicola Sturgeon has condemned ""racist thugs"" as she described disorder in Glasgow city centre as ""disgraceful"". Six men have been arrested by police after two separate protest groups gathered in George Square. National Defence League supporters went to the square saying they wanted to ""make and stand"" and ""protect the Cenotaph"". Shortly afterwards activists from No Evictions Glasgow arrived for their planned demonstration. They chanted ""refugees are welcome here"" before leaving the square. Images on social media showed some protestors clashing with police. Both the first minister and Humza Yousaf, the Scottish justice secretary, used social media to condemn the scenes. The first minister tweeted: ""Disgraceful scenes in Glasgow tonight. Racist thugs shame Scotland. ""If they break the law, they should face the full force of it. And all of us should unite to say that welcoming refugees and asylum seekers is part of who we are."" Mr Yousaf said on Twitter that he had been briefed on the incident by Police Scotland. ""Let's not mince our words, this has nothing to do with statues and everything to do with racist thuggery,"" he said. ""Police have made a number of arrests already and will continue to take all necessary action against those responsible."" Ahead of the protests, Ch Supt Mark Hargreaves urged people not to attend the events but follow government coronavirus lockdown guidelines. Afterwards, he said Police Scotland had an ""appropriate"" presence to ensure public safety. ""So far, six men have been arrested for minor public order offences and reports will be submitted to the procurator fiscal,"" he added. ""The majority of protesters have now left George Square and officers remain in the area for public reassurance. ""A review will be undertaken and should any further criminality be identified appropriate action will be taken."" Four of the protestors who were arrested said they were in the square to protect the statues, while the other two men said they were attending the protest calling for better housing for asylum seekers.

11,Nationwide caps mortgage lending due to virus,The UK's biggest building society is lowering its ceiling on mortgage lending to new customers.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:14:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53084853,"The UK's biggest building society has tripled the minimum deposit it will ask for from first-time buyers. The Nationwide will lower its ceiling for mortgage lending to new customers in response to the coronavirus crisis. It said the change, from Thursday, was due to ""these unprecedented times and an uncertain mortgage market"". First-time buyers are likely to be the most significantly affected because they often have smaller amounts saved to get on the property ladder. Nationwide has reduced the proportion of a home's value that is willing to lend from 95% to 85%. So for example, if a property costs £100,000, a new buyer would now need a £15,000 deposit rather than a £5,000 deposit. Nationwide made the move in case house prices fall and buyers go into negative equity - that is when the debt is greater than the value of the property. But it was also to cut the risk of customers not being able to make repayments if they lose their jobs. ""Our priority at this time must be to help members keep their homes. As such, we need to ensure our members can afford their repayments, while doing what we can to protect them from falling into negative equity,"" said Henry Jordan, Nationwide director of mortgages. After the elation over the re-opening of the housing market, Nationwide's move to limit how much we can borrow will bring everyone down to earth. If there is a downward lurch in house prices, recent buyers with big loans will be in serious danger of slipping into negative equity. Anyone who has been there in previous recessions will tell you it is stressful experience, and not just because of the usual worry about meeting the monthly payments. You can feel trapped, because if you sell you make a loss. Plus, there is virtually no prospect of getting another loan to move up the ladder. Of course, people who are priced out the market will welcome cheaper property, if that is what happens. But Nationwide is saying that it is time to ""protect"" us from risking too much to get a dream home. David Hollingworth, associate director of communications at L&C Mortgages, said that Nationwide was following many other major UK mortgage lenders. ""The market has been changing quickly,"" he said. When the lockdown started, many institutions dramatically dropped the percentage of a property's price they were willing to lend: this is known as the loan-to-value ratio. As the housing market has reopened, those maximum loan-to-value ceilings have been rising again, but not up to Nationwide's previous level of 95%. In a sense, Nationwide is now ""running with the rest of the pack"", Mr Hollingworth said. Some lenders, such as HSBC, still have mortgages with a 90% loan-to-value ratio. However, there is more demand for that type of mortgage than many banks have the capacity to deal with at the moment, he said. Emma Harvey, mortgages director at MoneySuperMarket, said: ""It's getting harder to borrow money to buy a house, as providers look to limit risk in these uncertain times, and Nationwide is the latest example of this. ""In addition, there are also fewer mortgage products out there to choose from. For example, whilst 90% [loan-to-value] mortgages were commonplace at the start of 2020, only a handful of lenders are still offering these, and even then only with restrictions."" Ms Harvey said that it has always been a good idea to have as large a deposit as you can save. ""If you're looking to get on the housing market, you should review your finances, look for areas of savings and be realistic about when you will be in a position to purchase a property. ""But with the Bank of England base rate so low, there are some great deals out there at the moment for people with a healthy deposit,"" she added."
12,Rashford's free school meals victory 'chance to end holiday hunger',"After Marcus Rashford's successful campaign, what do charities and schools want to happen?","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 14:30:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53079784,"After his victory on free school meals Marcus Rashford has called for more to be done for families who need them. With the nation's attention on holiday hunger, what do charities and head teachers want to happen now? Downing Street has said all 1.3 million children eligible for free school meals in England would benefit from a ""Covid summer food fund"". But food banks and charities say the government could go further by permanently funding meals outside of term time. Before the government implemented a scheme to feed those on free meals, head teacher Richard Gilpin delivered food to families on his bike after schools closed to most pupils in March The current scheme provides those eligible with a voucher worth about £15 a week per child. Extending it over summer, as Rashford had called for, will cost £120m. Mr Gilpin, from Pittville Secondary School in Cheltenham, said the decision was the right one but that it needed to last beyond the summer. ""If it's still the case at Christmas, great, but it can't just be a one-off,"" he said. ""This can't just be a reaction to a high-profile footballer for the summer."" More than a fifth of pupils at Pittville are on free school meals and Mr Gilpin said staff had set up their own food bank to help. ""The government has to acknowledge that families will struggle for a long time even after schools are open to everyone and families are back to work,"" he said. ""Young people are already suffering in terms of mental health and that's before we get to the problem families face in getting food on the table."" Neil Gingell, from Melksham in Wiltshire, said the decision was ""great"", but has found problems with the voucher scheme and hopes that will not affect people receiving them in the summer. The 45-year-old, who cares for his partner and has three children, said: ""We were a week behind with the food vouchers, then we had two lots, then some of the vouchers didn't work. ""If you're going to give out meals during the holiday, then you need to actually do it. ""We have family who are helping us out but there are people out there who have no help at all,"" David Nightingale, head teacher of Moorfield Primary School in Irland, Salford, said without the announcement there would have been many families feeling ""apprehensive"" about the holidays. He said he was working with staff living in the local community to make them a point of contact for parents regarding the vouchers over the summer break. ""We're in a situation where there are so many worries, to have this worry taken off the shoulders of parents and carers has been hugely welcomed,"" he said. Mr Nightingale said he would also welcome the scheme being extended into the Christmas holidays, to provide a ""safety net"" for parents at a time where finances would be increasingly stretched. In England about 1.3 million children - 15% of those in state education - were eligible for and claiming free school meals last year. Parts of London, the north and Midlands had more than a quarter of children receiving the dinners during term time. The coronavirus pandemic has hampered the ability of charities and community groups to help children. They have not been able to run holiday clubs, where they would provide meals outside of term time. Andrew Forsey, from the charity Feeding Britain, said: ""We owe a huge debt of gratitude to Marcus Rashford - a man who has done incredibly well for himself, but hasn't forgotten his roots - who is not only raising money for this cause, but has led this successful effort to help the government dig itself out of a massive hole."" He said the government's intention to roll out a ""programme of nutritious meals, accessible childcare and activities"" in the summer holidays held the key to consigning 'holiday hunger' to the history books."" The Big Help Project, which runs a food bank and food club in Knowsley, Merseyside, has seen demand double since the lockdown started. The area has one of the highest rates of children on free school meals, with more than a third in state education receiving them. Assistant chief executive Sue Torpey said: ""Demand has sky-rocketed. So this announcement is excellent but it needs to go beyond the summer. ""We've been running play schemes in the holidays for years to make sure children have meals outside of term time. ""These are community funded and it's never enough. The government could change this if it wanted to. The opportunity is there."" The Children's Society has called on the government to make the free school meal extension permanent. Mark Russell, its chief executive, said: ""Provision should be extended to more low income working families who unfairly miss out. This will provide a vital lifeline to all children."" Magic Breakfast, a charity which provides school breakfasts to children, said the job of solving ""holiday hunger"" was not done. CEO Alex Cunningham said: ""This is not a solution, if normality ever returns there will still be children at risk of hunger...our long term aim is that schools will have permanent funding for breakfast clubs."" Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the government was proud to have introduced ""universal free school meals"" for children up to Year 2 regardless of need. He said there were hundreds of thousands ""fewer families living in poverty now than there were in 2010"". The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"
13,Kristen Stewart to play Princess Diana in new film,Kristen Stewart's lines will be scripted by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:07:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53083302,"Twilight actress Kristen Stewart will play Princess Diana in a new film about the late princess's break-up from Prince Charles, according to reports. Stewart will star in Spencer, set in the early 1990s, which will be scripted by Peaky Blinders creator Steven Knight, Hollywood news sites say. Director Pablo Larrain said Stewart was ""one of the great actors around today"". The film will be set at Sandringham and will show Diana realising her marriage isn't working. ""We decided to get into a story about identity, and around how a woman decides somehow, not to be the queen,"" Larrain told Deadline. ""She's a woman who, in the journey of the movie, decides and realises that she wants to be the woman she was before she met Charles."" Diana Spencer married Prince Charles in 1981. They separated in 1992 and divorced in 1996. She died in a car crash in Paris the following year. Stewart is best known for playing Bella Swan in the hit Twilight franchise from 2008-12, and also appeared in last year's Charlie's Angels remake and 2014's Snow White and the Huntsman. ""Kristin can be many things, and she can be very mysterious and very fragile an ultimately very strong as well, which is what we need,"" added Larrain, who also made Jackie, 2016's biopic of Jackie Kennedy. The Princess of Wales has been portrayed on screen before - Naomi Watts played her in the critically panned 2013 film Diana. And the princess is due to appear in the fourth season of Netflix's royal drama The Crown, portrayed by newcomer Emma Corrin. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

14,The new rules for a safe 'day out',"Theme parks, museums and leisure attractions are working out how they can reopen safely.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:33:35 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53070380,"Theme parks, museums and leisure centres are working out how they could reopen safely, as lockdown restrictions ease in the UK. Even riding on a rollercoaster is going to require a face mask and social distancing when attractions open up again. Blackpool's Pleasure Beach has decided that, on a ride on which people scream, visitors will be more comfortable if they are made to mask up. It is also going to be a less sociable experience - the seats on its Icon ride are only a metre apart so there will be empty rows to allow social distancing. After the opening of shops, England's leisure and cultural attractions are preparing for a government announcement that they too will be allowed to reopen. However, it will be months before many venues will be in a position to allow the public in again. A report from the Creative Industries Federation says 400,000 jobs are at risk and the cultural and creative economy is losing more than £1bn a week in revenue. It's this dire situation that is driving planning to ensure institutions will be able to reopen quickly once the government gives the green light. Museums will be some of the first spaces to reopen their doors but it will be a different experience. The Design Museum in London is removing its ticket desks and is moving to an online ticketing system to avoid the need for physical tickets and queues. There will also be a strict 90-minute time limit to reduce crowding and everyone will be directed along a one-way route. Toilets will be one in, one out. It will be a similar experience at hundreds of other venues. James Adebayo from property consultants Tunji Adebayo & Co has been advising on how to make socially distanced spaces. There are, he says, a series of measures that will become commonplace. Venues will increasingly have designated viewing points with limits on how long you can linger. And there will in many places be strict one-way systems to stop dawdling and bumping in to fellow visitors. Every one of them will do things slightly differently but here is a list of things you could well experience on a day out. Of course, this will only affect venues and attractions which can control the public.  Some, such as live music venues, which rely on crowds standing together face a much longer wait and a huge hole in their revenue. Follow us on Facebook or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

15,'Invisible' unpaid carers going hungry in lockdown,"Unpaid carers looking after their parents and relatives are turning to food banks, say researchers.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:38:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-53070741,"Christie Michael is so worried about protecting her elderly mother that she has not gone outside her front door since the lockdown began in March. She says it is ""lonely and isolating"" - but the mother and daughter in Essex have also found themselves hungry. Research from Sheffield and Birmingham universities suggests more than 100,000 unpaid carers in the UK have had to rely on food banks during the pandemic. Helen Walker of Carers UK says unpaid carers are at ""breaking point"". The study looked at the experiences of people caring for parents and disabled relatives during the lockdown - and found 229,000 unpaid carers were in households where people had ""gone hungry"". Christie, now in her thirties, lives with her mother in Waltham Abbey and has been caring for her since childhood - watching over her mother as she suffered from seizures and other health problems. But during the lockdown they faced a different kind of problem: ""We were actually hungry."" Christie did not want to risk going to the shops while she was shielding her 76-year-old mother. And even if they could have got an online delivery, they didn't have enough money - so much so that they depended on deliveries brought by food banks. ""People don't understand the importance of food banks,"" she says, or how widely they are now being used. When they had emptied their cupboards, using up the baked beans and cereals, she said they were ""not eating"". ""I don't know what we would have done without the food bank."" When government food parcels did arrive, she didn't like to complain that much of it contained dairy products, when her mother was lactose intolerant. As a full-time carer she is entitled to a carer's allowance of about £67 per week - and the Carers UK charity is pushing for an increase. But even with other benefits on top, Christie says her current reality is ""spending every penny on food, rent and bills"". Every other cost that comes along, ""like something breaking down"", means borrowing and that creates another second wave of financial problems. What makes it tougher, says Christie, is the lack of recognition for such carers, protecting the people they love, but spending their waking hours looking after someone and being trapped without any money. During the lockdown, she says the sense of being invisible and forgotten has been even more intense. She has remained behind her door - and doesn't expect to be outside until the end of July, so as not to ""put mum in jeopardy"". In the past, she says there were some respite hours available to people caring for relatives - but that has gone. And she calls for a more consistent approach for support available for carers. The study from academics at Birmingham and Sheffield universities suggests that unpaid carers are twice as likely to have used food banks during the pandemic, compared to the general population. Professor Sue Yeandle of Sheffield University says this should ""shock the nation"". ""It cannot be right that carers are hidden from view, with declining mental wellbeing or face hunger or food poverty,"" she says. The chief executive of Carers UK, Helen Walker, says: ""Surely when the majority of carers are providing even more care for relatives during this pandemic, and spending more to do so, they deserve some help?"" A spokeswoman from the Department for Health and Social Care said: ""The government is hugely grateful for the crucial role that carers play, especially during this unprecedented period and we recently announced an extra £63m to support people struggling to afford food and other essentials due to coronavirus. ""The rate of carer's allowance was recently increased and we are working closely with carers organisations to further support carers during this outbreak, including funding to extend Carers UK's helpline opening times so unpaid carers are able to access trusted information and advice."""

17,Coronavirus: What’s it like to start a new job when working remotely?,"With many people working from home due to the coronavirus outbreak, what’s it like to start a new job on a remote team?","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:09:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52900325,"Meeting your new team and being shown round the office is one of the biggest parts of starting a new job. But how does it feel when everyone is working from home? Halfway through my video call with Nicole Rouwenhorst for this article, something embarrassing happens. “Um, I’m afraid that’s the doorbell,” I say apologetically. “Can you stay on the video call for two minutes? Someone has arrived to collect my daughter’s scooter.” Nicole laughs, because it’s exactly the point she was trying to make before we were so rudely interrupted. The 23-year-old joined a marketing firm in Manchester called Social just as lockdown started. She had to get to know her 40 new colleagues purely online. She had anxiety about building personal relationships this way. But it’s actually been fine, she says, precisely because of little incidents like my scooter visit. “In some ways video calls are even better than face-to-face encounters in the office,” says Nicole. It can be easier getting to know people in their natural, home environment, she reckons. She’s enjoyed random domestic interruptions by pugs, tabby cats and toddlers. “You’ll find out, ‘Oh, they’ve just got an Asos package, I like Asos too.’ It just sparks conversations.” Nicole also worried about the psychological effects of isolation, because she lives in a one-bedroom flat on her own. Fun social activities with colleagues have kept up her spirits, she says. Using Facebook's online platform called Workplace, her team play games with names like #showusyourstation and #guessthelocation. In the latter, colleagues show part of a picture on display in their house, like a photo from a holiday, and then everyone has to guess where it is. It’s another good icebreaker, says Nicole. It was the online treasure hunt that really made Annelies Harte, 49, feel that she belonged. She is a leisure club manager at a retirement village that has just opened in south London. Residents moved into their properties in May. She’s one of a newly formed team of 22 people. They had to meet, bond and get everything ready remotely, because of lockdown. She and her colleagues got into teams for the treasure hunt, remembers Annelies. There was a PowerPoint presentation containing riddles, which gave clues about obscure household objects, which you then had to find: things like garlic crushers, shoe horns and egg cups. This online game was a great bonding exercise because it was interactive and revealed people's personalities, especially their competitive instincts, says Annelies. The clues also became great talking points. Younger colleagues, for instance, were confused when asked to find a CD in their house. “’What are you talking about?’ they said,” remembers Annelies, laughing. The treasure hunt exercise was part of an online induction programme that included a welcome from the chief executive, an overview of company policy and a guide to health and safety. ""Initially everyone just looks at the screen and looks up and down - you feel that distance - but then you realise you are all in the same boat,"" says Annelies. She warns that at first louder people will dominate, because video calling software prioritises their voices. This is one reason she was grateful they also moved into online breakout rooms, for smaller group sessions. But overall, she feels her virtual induction went fine.  “I’ve really bonded with people in a more intense way than I would normally,” she says. Although Nicole and Annelies have both had positive experiences of joining a business remotely, others can struggle. Rosie Evans is a behavioural scientist with the CoachHub consultancy. She has advised companies about ""onboarding"" - bringing a new starter into the team - during the lockdown period. “It can feel very disorientating and daunting for many people, especially if you don’t have the kind of personality that means you are happy to arrange meetings with your new colleagues,” she says. Normally it’s left to new joiners to initiate social ties in the team, she adds. But in these challenging times, it’s important for employers to provide extra structure and support. When Henry Moffett, 34, made his first appearance before new colleagues on a Microsoft Teams call about a marketing pitch, he was struck by the “palpable silence”. He felt it was an ominous start. He’d been with his previous company for seven years, so this was a big transition for him. It was only later that his colleagues explained to him what had happened. They had thought he was a new client, so they were nervous. Henry works for HeyHuman, a marketing consultancy that uses neuroscience technology to test potential advertising campaigns. He started his new job on 6 April. His company had sent him a laptop and all the kit he needed to work remotely, so he could get up and running straight away. After his false start on the embarrassing video call, he did a series of one-on-one calls with colleagues, before a general introduction to the whole team. “It was surreal, waving gormlessly at 50 people from the sofa in my flat,"" he remembers. More Technology of Business For a company used to using technology to analyse human behaviour, it’s been a chance to turn the scrutiny back on themselves. And Henry can see the drawbacks of a working life defined by video calls. “When you can’t fall back on the nuances [you pick up] in physical meetings, it can be difficult to judge how things are going,"" he says. ""Silences during traditional meetings aren’t unusual, but on virtual meetings it feels like they need filling.” Seeing your face constantly relayed back at you on your computer while you're talking is also stressful, he thinks. “It’s surprisingly draining because you are so hyper-aware of how you are presenting yourself.” But like the others, he feels he’s managed to integrate into his new team successfully. He’s simply learned to adapt his behaviour. He takes “mental breaks” while working, by turning off the video camera for more informal calls. And of course he makes sure he’s always introduced properly at the start of meetings. You can follow business reporter Dougal on Twitter: @dougalshawbbc"
18,How Elon Musk aims to revolutionise battery technology,Could the least exciting bit of Elon Musk's empire end up being the most transformative?,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:31:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53067009,"Elon Musk has perhaps the most exciting portfolio of businesses on the planet. There's SpaceX with its mission to Mars, and Tesla with its super-fast hi-tech electric cars. He claims his Hyperloop concept could revolutionise public transport. And even his Boring Company is kind of interesting - it aims to find new ways to dig tunnels. So which one will end up changing the world most? It is my contention that it will be his battery business. Doesn't sound that scintillating does it? But the compact, lightweight lithium batteries that mean you can now stream movies on wafer-thin phones will soon be powering much more of your life. You're probably already interested in the potential of electric cars. But maybe you also have the usual concerns about actually buying one:  the price, the range, and worries about where you are going to charge the thing and how long you'll be stuck there. Yet the market certainly seems to reckon they are the future. Just look at the Tesla share price. Last week it briefly nudged ahead of Toyota to become the world's most valuable car firm, even though the Japanese giant sold 30 times as many vehicles last year. One reason is that Elon Musk has been teasing investors and rivals with the promise of ""battery day"" some time soon, at which he will announce a series of advancements in battery tech. And cars are not the only vast new battery market. You might have seen a story I wrote about how the world is slowly weaning itself off coal. Well, gigantic batteries connected to our electricity grids are going to be central to the great renewable energy revolution too. ""We are entering into a nearly exponential growth phase"", says Prof Paul Shearing. He's an expert on emerging battery technologies at University College London. He expects electric vehicles alone to drive European battery demand up by a factor of 10 this decade. But this explosion in demand will only be possible if we can make batteries cheaper, more durable and more efficient. That is a big ask for any technology but fear not, Mr Musk's proposed ""battery day"" comes thanks to a whole cascade of breakthroughs. The first of these was announced just last week when the Chinese battery-maker that supplies most of the major car makers, including Tesla, revealed it had produced the first ""million mile battery"". Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) says its new battery is capable of powering a vehicle for more than a million miles (1.2 million, to be precise - or 1.9 million km) over a 16-year lifespan. Most car batteries offer warranties for 60,000-150,000 miles over a three to eight-year period. This is a huge improvement in battery life, but will cost just 10% more than existing products, says CATL chair, Zeng Yuqun. Having a battery you never need to change is obviously good news for the electric car industry. But longer-lasting batteries are also essential for what's known as ""stationary"" storage too. These are the batteries we can attach to wind turbines or solar panels so renewable energy is available when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing. Fairly soon you might even want a stationary battery in your home to store cheap off-peak electricity, or to collect the power your own solar panels generate. The next barrier that is likely to be broken is price. The landmark challenge in the electric vehicle industry is to get a battery costing under $100 (£78) per kilowatt hour. ""At that point you start to get electric vehicles that are cheaper than the equivalent internal combustion vehicles,"" says Seth Weintraub, a US battery technology journalist. Once that happens the internal combustion engine will be effectively dead., he says, comparing it to how digital killed off film cameras a decade ago. ""In car dealerships we're going to go from one electric vehicle in the back lot somewhere, to one gas vehicle in the back lot somewhere."" So when will this crucial price-point be passed? He believes it already has. Mr Weintraub says his sources tell him these batteries are going into Teslas right now, and thinks this will be one of Mr Musk's ""battery day"" revelations. Cheaper batteries will address some of the other key concerns potential customers have. That is because it will make it economical to put bigger batteries into cars. That has two major advantages. First, it means they can go much further on a single charge, so you'll soon be able to buy cars with ranges of 400-500 miles (640-800km) or more. Second, big batteries charge faster for the bulk of their capacity, so you might be able to get up to 300 miles of range with just 10 minutes of charging. That's comparable to the time it takes to fill a car with petrol or diesel. So expect Elon Musk to announce upgrades for the Model S and X which will combine 400-500 mile range with supercar performance, says Mr Weintraub. So, where are we going to make all these wonderful new batteries? Again, we are expecting some major announcements from Mr Musk. Earlier this month his private jet reportedly landed at Luton airport. The man, who actor Robert Downey Jr used as inspiration for Marvel's Tony Stark in the 2008 film Iron Man, is believed to have been flown by helicopter to a 650-acre site just outside Bristol. The location is reckoned to be the prime UK candidate for one of Tesla's ""Gigafactories"", the huge battery plants it's pioneering. And he is planning an even bigger factory in the US, probably in Austin, Texas. According to Seth Weintraub this one will be a ""Terafactory"". That's quite an upgrade. Gigafactories were so called because they would produce batteries that could store billions of watt-hours of power. By that reasoning a terafactory should be able to make batteries with a total capacity in the trillions of watt-hours. And the logic of Mr Musk's ever-expanding factories remains the same. The bigger the scale, the easier it will be to deliver cost-slashing innovations, he believes. So where are all the battery chemicals going to come from? Tesla's Chinese partner CATL has found a way to make batteries free of cobalt, at least for shorter-range vehicles. Cobalt is expensive and a lot is sourced from DR Congo, where it has been associated with child labour. There are no plans to get rid of the key ingredient in lightweight batteries, lithium. There are large supplies in salt deposits around the world, including the biggest single reserve - as yet unexploited - in the hauntingly beautiful Salar de Uyuni salt plain in the remote Bolivian Andes. The problem is the current method of separating out the lithium in these deposits is slow and inefficient. The biggest salt lake currently being mined is the Salar de Atacama in Chile.  And at their significantly lower altitude, the Chileans can use natural evaporation to crystallise the salts, driven by the intense sunshine of the Atacama Desert. Despite these advantages, the process still takes months, and only recovers about 30% of the available lithium. Which is where a wannabe Elon Musk-style tycoon with a similarly exotic name comes in. Teague Egan is working with scientists on what he says is a ""nanoparticle"" filter that can separate lithium from other salts in solution, and will recover more like 90% of the lithium. Instead of months, he reckons it could eventually take just a few days. Mr Egan says his firm EnergyX is already talking to key players about applying the technology on a commercial scale. If effective it could dramatically cut the cost of lithium - removing one of the biggest bottlenecks to the ramping up of battery production.. Which brings us back to my original premise - that batteries will be the most transformative part of Elon Musk's empire. Mr Musk's ambition is to create the iPhone of cars - a must-buy product that revolutionises our driving experience, while also delivering him a big fat profit. That's what will make us ditch our old diesel and petrol cars. But there is also something much bigger at stake: climate change. If cheaper, better batteries enable a rapid switch to electric vehicles, and give us renewable energy whatever the weather, then clearly they are going to be central to efforts to decarbonise our economy. Astronauts blasting off into space are a lot more exciting than a grey box with a couple of wires attached. But if that grey box helps us jettison fossil fuels, then the grey box wins in terms of its power to change our world. Of course, you may disagree. And if you do, then please tell me why. @BBCJustinR"
19,George Floyd death: Three police reform plans compared,"Republicans, Democrats and the White House have proposed plans to policing. So what's the fine print?","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:17:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53083560,"Republican senators have unveiled their plans to improve policing following the death of George Floyd. How does it compare with those put forward by the White House and Democrats? And which will succeed? In advance of national guidance from Washington, police departments across the country have begun taking reforms on themselves. Police departments in major US cities like Denver, Chicago and Phoenix have all banned chokeholds in the wake of Mr Floyd's death. And the New York police commissioner announced this week that the anti-crime unit - a team of roughly 600 plain clothes officers - would be disbanded. But these patchwork efforts would be bolstered by federal legislation, which could make police reforms mandatory nationwide. After weeks of mass protest against police use of force and institutional racism across the US, the machinery of the federal government is grinding into action. Democrats in the House of Representatives have approved sweeping reforms. Donald Trump signed an executive order that will encourage police departments to set new guidelines for training and procedures. Now Senate Republicans have their own proposal, which provides legislative backing for many of the president's moves. That both parties have been able to move reasonably quickly during an election year, when legislative accomplishments are traditionally few, underscores a national consensus about the urgency of the moment. Even so, the chances for co-operation on the issue are still far from certain. Democrats may decide a modest compromise on what they see as Republican half-measures would give their opponents a victory - and decrease the likelihood of more substantive reforms after November's elections. Republicans may conclude broader Democratic reforms would hinder police departments and put officers at risk, while preventing the party from using ""law and order"" as a campaign issue against Democrats in the autumn. Even with pressure for action mounting, both sides may end up deciding it's better to take the issue to the voters in November."
20,Love Island Australia: Imports help reality TV cope with the new reality,Love Island Australia is one of several imports and repeats now filling the schedules.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:15:09 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53078839,"Viewers who are missing their summer Love Island fix have been sampling the Australian version - which is one of a string of reality TV imports and repeats peppering the UK's TV schedules. The regular Love Island was cancelled because of coronavirus, so the 2018 Aussie series is now on ITV2 instead. And with filming on most reality shows now on hold in the UK, ITV has also started showing the US edition of The Masked Singer, while the BBC has bought the rights to Drag Race Canada. E4, which is currently also repeating classic episodes of the British Big Brother, will also show Married At First Sight Australia. As far as talent shows are concerned, lockdown left Britain's Got Talent and The Voice UK viewers hanging mid-series, while the BBC's big spring singing contest starring Little Mix was pushed back. Producers are now trying to figure out how to salvage the usual autumn and winter ratings winners like The Great British Bake Off, Strictly Come Dancing, The Apprentice and I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Not all new reality shows have been scuppered by the lockdown, however. Channel 4 has announced a new series and a celebrity version of The Circle, in which contestants are helpfully locked away and communicate via a social media platform. ""It's basically isolation... an entertainment format that has now bled and become real life,"" TV critic Scott Bryan joked on BBC Radio 5 Live. Love Island Australia launched on Monday with almost 500,000 live viewers - 15% of the total who tuned in for the launch of last summer's series. Many were struck by the lack of diversity and levels of superficiality and bravado that put even the British version to shame, with quotes like: ""It's a deal-breaker if a guy doesn't have a boat""; and ""I'm so good looking, I'm so pretty"". The series was on Australian TV two years ago, highlighting one drawback of airing existing series from other countries - spoilers. That's a particular danger with the second series of The Masked Singer US - a show that relies so much on mystery - which is on ITV on Saturday afternoons, eight months after it went out in the States. But TV critic Emma Bullimore says importing shows is ""a clever idea"" in the circumstances. ""In terms of entertainment shows, this has obviously been a really difficult time, as it has across the board,"" she tells BBC News. ""It is more difficult to show a repeat of Britain's Got Talent than it is to show a repeat of Broadchurch, so it seems the smart thing to do - to think, these formats have worked right across the world, why not show one of the other country's versions of the shows that we love? ""Of course we don't live in an insular world any more and there are spoilers everywhere on the internet. But if you want to watch it and enjoy it, you can choose not to look it up."" With Big Brother, whose Best Shows Ever are currently being repeated on E4, it's more about indulging in nostalgia than trying not to remember who actually won. ""It was such a different piece of telly, and people have so much nostalgia and memories wrapped up in it,"" Bullimore says. ""It was fascinating to watch the first one with that Nasty Nick moment - it's so tame now compared to things that happen on reality shows, but it was so dramatic back then."" It's not just reality shows that have been dredging up old memories - the soaps have also turned to classic moments to make up for new episodes being scaled back. EastEnders finally ran out of new episodes on Tuesday, when the programme ended with the words: ""To be continued..."" Bullimore points out that TV executives are ""not just rehashing things - there have been some really good, clever last-minute commissions"". Shows from Grayson Perry's Art Club to Jamie Oliver's Keep Cooking & Carry On and Peter Crouch's Save Our Summer have been hastily put together, with varying degrees of success. ""It's been a space for creativity and innovation,"" she says. ""But you just can't have Love Island now, you just can't have a big talent show. It's just not going to work."" So what will become of the major entertainment shows that are due on air in the coming months? ITV said Britain's Got Talent and The Voice will pick up where they left off ""later this year"". But those live shows are unlikely to have a studio audience. I'm A Celebrity is expected to go ahead in November as usual, but it's not yet clear where and how. Bake Off normally reaches screens in late August, but filming has been delayed and a Channel 4 spokeswoman said it would start ""as soon as it is safe to do so"". Meanwhile, the BBC has ""committed"" to the return of Strictly this year, with the professional dancers set to start rehearsing remotely at the end of July. Strictly and Bake Off are both shows where some or all of the cast and crew may be required to isolate together in order to protect them from the virus. The Apprentice normally starts in October, but filming on that was delayed too, and Lord Sugar said in April that it could return in the spring, or be postponed for a whole year. Another series that's usually a fixture at the end of the year is The X Factor. But bosses accidentally pre-empted the lockdown restrictions, with Simon Cowell reportedly having decided in early February to ""rest"" it for a year. If the pandemic continues, viewers can rest easy that there's lots of TV out there to fill the schedules. Love Island alone is shown in Romania, Poland, Belgium, Sweden - and 10 other countries.

21,The blogger who hit back against a hammer-wielding Russian ‘assassin’,Tumso Abdurakhmanov says Russia's security service must have helped Chechens plan an attempt to assassinate him.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:21:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53066537,"Sergei Skripal was poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok, Alexander Litvinenko was killed with radioactive polonium… by contrast the man who attacked Chechen blogger Tumso Abdurakhmanov was armed with nothing more than a hammer. But he is still convinced that Russian security services were involved, reports Nick Sturdee. It's 26 February 2020. A half-naked man is catching his breath, filming himself in the half light. He's just grabbed the phone and is streaming live on Instagram. He switches from selfie mode and we see a second man, fully dressed, lying face down next to a bed. From his head, a half-metre trail of thick blood, pasted along a linoleum floor across which he has apparently been dragged. ""Who sent you?"" demands the man who is filming. ""Who sent you?!"" he repeats, raising his voice. His name is Tumso Abdurakhmanov, and he's a Chechen blogger living in hiding in the town of Gavle, in eastern Sweden. He's holding a hammer, and anxiously looks over his shoulder - clearly concerned there might be someone else in the flat. ""Who sent you, I asked!"" The man groans. He says weakly that he was sent by a man from Grozny - the Chechen capital. And that he's from Moscow. ""How did you get my address?"" asks Tumso. ""They told me."" ""And what's your name?"" ""Ruslan."" Tumso Abdurakhmanov is an asylum seeker, and he has just managed to beat off a man who assaulted him with a hammer as he slept. He has been expecting something like this to happen. In the preceding six months two other Chechen asylum seekers have been attacked - one gunned down in a Berlin park, the other stabbed to death in a hotel in northern France. He's been tipped off there's money on his head too. Three months later, speaking to the BBC from a new, secret location in Sweden, 34-year-old Tumso describes being woken by a series of blows to the head, the struggle to get out from under his duvet, and an exhausting wrestling match that ensued, on and off the bed. Tumso isn't a big man, but at a certain point he succeeded, stunned, in getting on top of his assailant, to see his own blood drip on to the other man's face and into his mouth. The bigger man then overpowered him, but eventually, as they struggled, the hammer fell from his slippery woollen gloves. Tumso then seized it and dealt a series of blows to his attacker's head. ""To start with he fought back fiercely, he tried to protect himself. But after a few blows with the hammer he started to talk to me. Up till then we hadn't spoken at all. I didn't know if he spoke Russian, or who he was. He gave his name. He said, 'Please don't hit me. I'll tell you everything.'"" Police arrived to find the gruesome spectacle of two Russian citizens, their heads bloodied from a vicious fight with a hammer. The larger, fully dressed man had already slipped into unconsciousness. The less wounded of the two - Tumso - was arrested. But after three days of police questioning he was reclassified as a crime victim, and the second man, 29-year-old Ruslan Mamaev, was detained on suspicion of attempted murder, which he denies. In an extremely rare development, the investigation was handed to the country's Security Services. For Tumso's lawyer, Jens Sjolund, the reason is clear - suspicions that another nation state is behind the attack. Russia. Tumso Abdurakhmanov is one of up to 130,000 Chechen refugees in European countries, many of whom have fled from the violent and tyrannical rule of the semi-autonomous republic's Kremlin-backed leader, Ramzan Kadyrov. He left three years ago after a run-in with the then mayor of Grozny, Kadyrov's cousin, led to threats that he would be disappeared - abducted, tortured and possibly killed - like so many other critics of the regime. Since then he has become the single most influential and prominent opponent of Kadyrov in a busy émigré blogosphere. With more than 350,000 subscribers to his YouTube channels - despite the fact that the population of Chechnya is only 1.2 million - he relentlessly hits out at Ramzan Kadyrov's apparently limitless power in Chechnya, the regime's human rights abuses and its corruption. New clouds began to gather for the blogger following a long phone conversation with Ramzan Kadyrov's right-hand man, the chair of the Chechen parliament, Magomed Daudov. In Chechnya this universally feared man, believed to be personally responsible for the well-documented campaign of persecution of the republic's gay community, is known simply by his nickname ""Lord"". Lord initiated the conversation with Tumso but found himself lambasted by the blogger, who then posted the whole thing on YouTube, in a series of posts lasting more than two hours. Later, when Tumso publicly called Kadyrov's father Akhmat a traitor for siding with the Russians in their 1999 invasion of the republic, Lord evidently decided it was time to teach him a lesson. In March last year Lord posted online an extraordinary announcement for a serving Russian state official. ""Tumso,"" he said, looking at his phone as he filmed himself, ""I am officially telling you from me, and from my brothers. You know who my brothers are. You talked about Akhmat [Kadyrov], and this is now a blood feud. For as long as I have blood in my veins, you are my enemy, and the enemy of my brothers. And we're going to find you."" The tradition of the blood feud, the revenge killing of a murderer or their relative, is still alive and well in Chechnya. That Tumso had killed nobody did not seem a problem for Lord. He went on to say that Tumso would not actually be killed, he'd just be given an ""amazingly fun time"". But for Chechens, the word for blood feud that Lord used - chir - leaves no room for doubt. Things looked even more ominous for Tumso when pro-government social media broadcast the spectacle of his remaining family in Chechnya - an elderly uncle and two other relatives - pronouncing that they were disowning the blogger. More than that, they explicitly gave permission for him to be murdered. ""Let them do whatever they like,"" said Tumso's uncle and cousins. ""He is no long longer part of our family. From this moment on, if anyone kills him, we allow that person to take his blood."" A blood feud was being publicly condoned - evidently under duress - by the planned victim's family. When the attack came, it was on Lord's birthday - a fact eerily reminiscent of the 2007 murder of the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, one of Kadyrov and Vladimir Putin's most prominent critics, who was shot dead on Putin's birthday, 7 October. In a defiant Instagram post after his release from police questioning, Tumso filmed himself smiling and winking mockingly at the camera, with the written message: ""Happy birthday, Daudov! Sorry I'm a bit late."" С днём рождения, Даудов! Прости, что припозднился 🔨😉 A post shared by  Mokhmad Abdurakhmanov (@abdurakhmanoff_bros) on Feb 29, 2020 at 3:53pm PST End of Instagram post  by abdurakhmanoff_bros Then he added a hammer emoji. Tumso - and many Chechens - were in no doubt who was behind the attack. The Chechen authorities deny involvement. Chechens in Europe's diasporas say they live under the constant threat of retribution and violence - visited either on themselves or on their relatives back at home. Critics have been beaten and pressured, and Kadyrov's opponents murdered widely over the years, in Qatar, Austria, Turkey and Dubai, as well as in Moscow and in Chechnya itself. Some were influential militants - sometimes accused of terrorist attacks in Russia - but others were political rivals, or merely critics. Russian security forces appear to have been involved in more than one of the killings. Last August Zelimkhan Khangoshvili, a senior commander in the second Chechen war (1999-2005), was approached by a man on a bike and in motorbike leathers in the Kleiner Tiergarten Park in Berlin. Khangoshvili had been on his way to his local mosque for Friday prayers, and had for some reason taken a diversion into the park. His family believe he had been lured there. The cyclist shot Khangoshvili several times, killing him with a shot to the head. He then jumped on a waiting hire scooter, and escaped to a secluded location by the nearby River Spree, where he changed into a pink T-shirt and shorts, and threw a bag into the water. Two teenage boys witnessed the scene and called the police. The man was arrested minutes later, just before he could disappear into the crowd of tourists in central Berlin. He presented a valid Russian passport under a false name. A bag was recovered from the Spree containing the leather clothes, a wig, and a Glock pistol. The assassination had been intricately and expertly planned and, if it hadn't been for the two boys, the killer would probably have escaped undetected. He had arrived in Berlin hours before the murder, after travelling to Poland where it is thought he picked up the pistol. He knew exactly where and when to find Khangoshvili, he had a means of getaway planted precisely where he needed it, and was evidently acting on a pre-determined exit plan. He must have been operating with accomplices and detailed intelligence - raising suspicions of a sophisticated hit by Russian intelligence. These suspicions grew after the journalist Christo Grozev, at the investigative website Bellingcat, established the true identity and biography of the killer - a former Russian special forces soldier called Vadim Krasikov. This man had already committed at least three contract killings in Russia - of businessmen and a regional politician - and had been shielded from prosecution by the intervention of the Russian security services, the FSB. Having identified Krasikov's phone number - through documents online relating to the purchase of a car by his wife - Grozev then used leaked mobile phone data to trace his movements over the weeks running up to his trip to Berlin. Other than his home, the locations where Krasikov had spent most time were the FSB anti-terrorism office in Moscow - for a few hours at a time - and a high-security and heavily restricted FSB special forces training camp just outside Moscow, where he had spent three days before travelling. The Russian security services, it appears, had trained and dispatched someone from the criminal world to eliminate a perceived enemy on the streets of Berlin. Grozev wasn't surprised. ""The FSB have their own contingent of former officers,"" he says. ""Or just criminals they can trust or they can hold forever indebted because of, for example, compromising material on them. The FSB is a very corrupt, sprawling organisation."" In January, a second Chechen was murdered by a travelling assassin, this time, in France. Unlike Khangoshvili, the victim was not a former military commander - he wasn't a potential security threat - but a blogger on medication for PTSD, who had insulted Ramzan Kadyrov online. Although Tumso Abdurakhmanov was in Sweden at the time, he was tipped off about the appearance of a suspicious Chechen, Usman Mamadiev, among the diaspora in Berlin. Immediately he feared for the safety of his wife, children, mother and brother, who were living in the German capital. He provided Mamadiev's details to German police, he says. But instead the visitor travelled on to Belgium. There he visited the blogger, Imran Aliev, whom he had befriended online, pretending to be a cancer patient travelling to Europe for treatment. On 29 January the two of them travelled to Lille, in northern France, checking in to the Coq Hardi Hotel. The next morning Aliev's body was found in their room, with a reported 135 stab wounds. By then Mamadiev had left for Berlin and was soon on a flight back to Moscow. Following Aliev's murder, Tumso carried out an investigation and posted the results online. He said he had established Mamadiev's connection to a close Kadyrov ally, a member of the Russian parliament for the ruling United Russia party, Adam Delimkhanov. He also reported that Mamadiev had suspiciously bought a car soon after his return home. The Chechen authorities have denied involvement in Imran Aliev's killing. It has not been possible to reach Mamadiev for comment. Less than a month later, Tumso himself was the target. His head and body are marked by scars and wounds from the hammer blows, and he is clearly extremely lucky to be alive. ""It was a miracle,"" he says. ""I realised that as I sat at the police station and thought through what had somehow passed me by. The first emotions you get are impossible to convey. You feel at that moment as though you've been born again, when you think of how you were on the very edge when someone was hitting you with a hammer."" It was fortunate, perhaps, that his family remained in Germany. Unlike Khangoshvili's killer, Tumso's attacker, Ruslan Mamaev, had not travelled on fake ID. It's even easy to find his Facebook page, where the last comment is from his father, Marat, wishing him a happy birthday last August. Photos reveal a tall man with Asiatic features and dark, modishly cut hair, sitting in what looks like a fashionable café, with Central Asian carpets behind him. Mamaev is originally from Kazakhstan, but moved to Omsk in Siberia as a boy. There he started college but dropped out, before travelling to Moscow and apparently working in construction. Judging from a 2018 court ruling, Mamaev seems to have had money problems. He was ordered to pay back half a million roubles - about £5,500 - that he had borrowed from a bank. I've reached out to some of Mamaev's friends and his family. His girlfriend told me on social media that he wouldn't harm another person, that the whole family is in shock and that she doesn't understand how or why he went to Sweden. Apart from that, no-one seems to want to talk. Nothing in Mamaev's biography seems to suggest a killer - nor any prior connection with Chechnya. But flight data records in Russia, leaked to Bellingcat, do demonstrate that he travelled to Grozny on two occasions shortly before he travelled to Sweden. He returned to Moscow from his second trip on 15 February. Five days later, he booked his flight to Copenhagen for 24 February. Two days after that he was in Tumso's flat in Sweden, with a hammer. It has also emerged that immediately after his December trip to Grozny, Mamaev flew to Copenhagen - on what looks like a short recce. According to Bellingcat, it was the first time he had ever travelled outside the former Soviet Union, and he speaks no foreign languages. Like Krasikov in Berlin, he would certainly have been receiving help from accomplices. A second individual, a Chechen woman, has been detained by Swedish police as a suspect. She travelled to Sweden from France shortly before the attack. And last weekend the Swedish authorities announced they were arresting - in absentia - a third Russian citizen. He's been named as Imran Khaskhanov, a Chechen from Mamaev's hometown of Omsk, and he's also believed to have travelled to Sweden at the time of the attack. Mamaev's motive for apparently trying to kill a man he had never met is unclear, but Tumso has a theory. Much as Vadim Krasikov may have been drawn into the FSB's orbit as a result of his prosecution for murder, Tumso believes that Mamaev's debts may have laid him open to recruitment and exploitation by those who wanted to organise an assassination attempt that could easily be denied. Tumso is confident that the organisation of the attack was beyond the abilities of Kadyrov's circle. Mamaev had managed to establish Tumso's address in hiding, to get through a door requiring a pincode, and to find and enter his apartment unnoticed as he slept. The blogger believes this points to FSB involvement. But Tumso is not a defector from Russian military intelligence, like Sergei Skripal, or a former officer of the FSB working as a consultant for British intelligence, like Alexander Litvinenko. Why would the FSB organise an assassination attempt on a Chechen blogger living in Sweden? Tumso, again, has an explanation - money. ""I have information - which I can't prove or confirm - that the FSB may have sold that information to Kadyrov. And if that's true, there's nothing remotely strange about that,"" he says. ""This is Russia - and it's totally normal for different state structures merely to sell things to each other. In Chechnya we've seen that for a long time."" The relationship between Russia and Chechnya, one of the Russian Federation's 22 republics, is itself partly a financial one. Moscow props up Chechnya by pouring in millions of dollars. In return Kadyrov's brutal rule ensures there is no dissent. ""It's a marriage of convenience,"" says Katya Sokirianskaia of the Moscow based Conflict Analysis and Prevention Centre. ""Very clearly Putin thinks that Ramzan is solving his problems in Chechnya. On the other hand, on the Ramzan side, it is very clear that Vladimir Putin guarantees his biological survival - the survival of Ramzan himself and his family, his children and his close friends, his circle."" Because Kadyrov and his circle, as they well know, can not only declare blood feuds - they can be the subject of them. ""Ramzan Kadyrov has blood enemies, and many of his associates as well. They have blood. People who blame them for death and humiliation. And they're waiting for the moment to take their revenge, to execute this blood feud. And Chechens can wait for a very long time."" It's not known who ordered Ruslan Mamaev to travel to Sweden and attack Tumso with a hammer as he slept. It's not known whether the FSB was involved, and it cannot be proved it was the execution of a blood feud But the second most powerful public official in Chechnya expressly warned of such an action, and pro-government social media effectively condoned it by carrying the statement made by Tumso's relatives, in which they gave their consent for him to be murdered. And for this, it would appear, neither Kadyrov nor the Chechen government have received any criticism from the Russian government - or President Vladimir Putin. A series of assassinations has taken place in Turkey of men from the countries of the former USSR. There's evidence that some were carried out by killers from Russia - including, in one case, names, photographs and a memory stick carelessly left behind for Turkish police to study. Have Russian hitmen been killing with impunity in Turkey? (2016)"
22,Portugal finally recognises consul who saved thousands from Holocaust,Eighty years ago a Portuguese consul gave visas to thousands fleeing the invading Nazis in France.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:23:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-53006790,"Eighty years ago, a middle-aged, mid-ranking diplomat sank into deep depression and watched his hair turn grey in days, as he saw the streets of Bordeaux filling with Jewish refugees fleeing the Nazis. As Portugal's consul in Bordeaux, Aristides de Sousa Mendes faced a moral dilemma. Should he obey government orders or listen to his own conscience and supply Jews with the visas that would allow them to escape from advancing German forces? Sousa Mendes' remarkable response means he is remembered as a hero by survivors and descendants of the thousands he helped to flee. But his initiative also spelt the end of a diplomatic career under Portuguese dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, and the rest of his life was spent in penury. Portugal finally granted official recognition to its disobedient diplomat on 9 June, and parliament decided a monument in the National Pantheon should bear his name. It was mid-June 1940 and Hitler's forces were days from completing victory over France. Paris fell on 14 June and an armistice was signed just over a week later. Portugal's diplomatic corps was under strict instruction from the right-wing Salazar dictatorship that visas should be issued to refugee Jews and stateless people only with express permission from Lisbon. For those thronging Bordeaux's streets hoping to cross into Spain and escape Nazi persecution there was no time to wait. ""We heard the French had surrendered and the Germans were on the move,"" says Henri Dyner. He was three, but retains vivid memories of his Jewish family's flight from their home in Antwerp, as Nazi Germany attacked Belgium and invaded France and the Netherlands. ""What I remember is the sound of the bombing, which must have woken me, and my mother telling me it was thunder. ""My parents turned on the radio and heard King Leopold telling Belgians we had been betrayed and attacked by the Germans. My father had been suspecting there could be a war since 1938. He had a plan, and a car,"" Mr Dyner, now a retired engineer living in New York, told the BBC. Eliezar Dyner, his wife Sprince and five other relatives, including a seven-month-old baby, drove away from the bombing and into France. ""My father avoided big roads, gave Paris a wide berth and stuck to the coast. He wanted to be only 10 miles ahead of the front all the time, because he thought it could be a quick war and why go too far when you might have to go back?"" After seeing German warplanes strafing French trenches and hearing the news of successive German victories, Henri's father realised by the time they reached Bordeaux there would be no return to Antwerp any time soon. In Bordeaux, the consul had struck up a friendship with a rabbi. Chaim Kruger had also fled the Nazi advance from his home in Belgium. Consul Sousa Mendes offered the rabbi and his immediate family safe passage across the Spanish border, but then suffered a ""moral crisis"", according to historian Mordecai Paldiel. Kruger refused the offer, as he could not abandon the thousands of other Jewish refugees in Bordeaux. In a letter dated 13 June 1940 Sousa Mendes wrote: ""Here the situation is horrible, and I am in bed because of a strong nervous breakdown."" ""No-one really knows what went through his mind in those two or three days,"" says Dr Paldiel, who ran the Righteous Among the Nations department at Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial centre for 25 years. ""Some say the duty of a diplomat is to obey orders from above, even if those instructions are not moral. ""Later on, in Lisbon, Sousa Mendes told a rabbi this: 'If so many Jews can suffer because of one Catholic, it's all right for one Catholic to suffer for many Jews.' He was talking about Hitler, of course."" Whatever did go through the diplomat's mind, Sousa Mendes emerged on Monday 17 June with a new determination. According to his son, Pedro Nuno de Sousa Mendes, ""he strode out of his bedroom, flung open the door to the chancellery, and announced in a loud voice: 'From now on I'm giving everyone visas. There will be no more nationalities, races or religions'."" For Henri Dyner and his family, this was a lifesaver. By chance Henri's mother knew the consul from his time in Antwerp, where she was a secretary at the British consulate. The Dyner family had already tried and failed to obtain visas from US, British and Canadian authorities to leave France. Before his breakdown, Sousa Mendes had put them on a list in a request sent to the Salazar government. ""My mother recalls that he disappeared for a couple of days, and when he came out, his hair had gone grey,"" says Henri Dyner, who remembers queues of refugees outside the consulate in Bordeaux and camping in squares. ""My mother actually began to work for Sousa Mendes those days, helping with this kind of production line of visas all down a long table. Sousa Mendes saved our lives."" No-one knows for sure how many transit visas were issued, allowing refugees to pass from France into Spain and travel onward to Portugal. But estimates range between 10,000 and 30,000, and most sought to cross the Atlantic to a variety of American destinations. The US-based Sousa Mendes Foundation has identified some 3,800 recipients of these visas. As if possessed with a sense of mission, the consul even signed visas on the road as crowds in Bordeaux began to form a human column southward towards the border town of Hendaye. He stopped at the consulate in Bayonne to issue more papers. The foreign ministry in Lisbon began sending cablegrams to Bordeaux, ordering him to desist, amid reports from colleagues that he had ""lost his senses"". Spanish authorities declared his visas invalid, but thousands had already made it across the Bidasoa river into Spain's Basque region. Eventually, Sousa Mendes reported to his bosses in Lisbon on 8 July. Among those who escaped occupied France thanks to his visas were surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, filmmaker King Vidor, members of the Rothschild banking family and the majority of Belgium's future government-in-exile. Salazar's Portugal would later be praised for its role in allowing refugees to escape from Nazi occupation and repression, but Sousa Mendes was expelled from the diplomatic corps and left without a pension. You may also be interested in: His family home in Cabanas de Viriato fell into ruin, though the exterior has since been restored. ""Sousa Mendes was mistreated by Salazar. He died in misery as a pauper, and his children emigrated to try to find a future somewhere else,"" says Henri Dyner. Henri's family ended up in Brazil, before he moved to the US for professional reasons. But he remembers a man who had courage in his convictions. ""The way things are in the world today, we need more people prepared to stand up for what is right and take a stand."""
23,India-China dispute: The border row explained in 400 words,Here's what you need to know about a border dispute that has turned deadly high in the Himalayas.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 21:29:08 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-53062484,"A military stand-off between India and China on their disputed border in the Himalayas has escalated into deadly clashes. In 400 words, here is all the important background to help you understand what is going on. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Monday night's incident. It happened in Galwan Valley in the disputed Ladakh region. China accused Indian troops of crossing the border twice, ""provoking and attacking Chinese personnel"". Both sides insisted that no shots were fired.  Indian officials gave accounts of fighting with bare hands, iron rods and stones. There were reports of Chinese casualties, but no official confirmation. Military officials from both countries later met to ""defuse the situation"", the Indian army said. The military superpowers have been arguing for decades over territory in the high-altitude, largely uninhabited region. Their armies come face to face at many points along the 3,440km (2,100-mile) shared border. The confrontation came after tensions bubbled up in recent months over a new road India built in Ladakh, along the Line of Actual Control which divides the sides. That angered China, which deployed troops and built infrastructure of its own in disputed territory, bringing the two sides' forces in closer proximity and heightening the risk of clashes. Both sides see the area as strategically important, economically and militarily. If neither gives way, the stand-off could have destabilising consequences for the region. The loss of life raises the stakes. Those deaths are believed to be the first in 45 years in a border confrontation between India and China. They have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. Potentially very, if efforts to reduce tensions fail. In recent days, army generals from India and China have been involved in talks aimed at resolving the border row. However, similar reconciliation attempts have stalled in the past. If they are not successful, there is a risk of escalation between two rivals who happen to be the world's most populous countries - and have nuclear weapons. ""This is extremely, extremely serious, this is going to vitiate whatever dialogue was going on,"" former Indian army commander DS Hooda said, commenting on Monday's clash."
24,Coronavirus: What is dexamethasone and how does it work?,A cheap steroid is hailed a big breakthrough in the treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patients.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:31:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53077879,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells. Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, and suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it has already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. In the UK the drug will cost £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make it and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for other conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"".

25,Coronavirus: Who should be shielding?,People at risk of becoming severely ill if they get coronavirus advised to take extra precautions.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:13:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51997151,"About 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home. This ""shielding"" is to protect lives. While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves. The virus poses a high risk if someone who is shielding is exposed to it. The guidance on shielding is being kept under review. Infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is significantly less than it has been. From Monday 1 June, people in England and Wales who are shielding have been able to spend some time outdoors again, while continuing to follow social distancing rules. In Northern Ireland, this change came in on 8 June. It means those with families can go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing - keeping 2m apart. Scotland says it will not consider recommending the same until 31 July at the earliest. Those most at risk, who include: While it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, more than half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. More than 90,000 are children. Anyone in this highest-risk category who has not yet received a letter from the NHS or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online. This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing. Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations. You could call your doctor to discuss this. It means staying at home and following the guidelines. You should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors. Visits from people who provide you with essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus, and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing them with soap and water. They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you. They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing. They should also keep some physical distance (2m) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window. If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels. If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing-up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too. Keep surfaces that are frequently touched - door handles, taps and handrails - clean. People in England can register to get essential food and medicine supplies if friends or family cannot help. Similar support is available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, people have been asked to shield until the end of June and this date will be reviewed; In Wales it's 16 August; in Scotland it's 31 July; and in Northern Ireland people have been advised to shield for at least 12 weeks from when they were first told to. The ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. A vaccine could help enable this. These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading: Keep physically active by exercising indoors or in your garden if that's possible. Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online. Prepare a hospital bag just in case. This should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments, as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas."
26,Coronavirus: Do I have to go back to work after lockdown?,"With lockdown restrictions eased, people are starting to go back to work. But what are your rights?","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:22:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52567567,"With many shops in England starting to reopen, the number of people back at work is growing. Cafes, restaurants and pubs could follow as soon as 4 July. Many people fear contracting coronavirus once they return to work. So, what are your rights? Employees who can work from home are advised by the government to continue to do so. For those who do return, full government guidance on working safely has been issued for everywhere from building sites to offices and shops. It includes separate advice for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Firms should be ready to ""move quickly"" if the rules change, says the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. That means employees might have little notice if their company wants them to get back to work. This may soon become an issue for workers in the hospitality sector, says employment law expert Simon Rice-Birchall from Eversheds Sutherland. After all, these are public-facing jobs and potentially carry a higher risk of catching the virus. Mr Rice-Birchall says that if people do not show up for work when asked, they should not expect to get paid. However, employers should be ""extremely careful"" about deciding to discipline or sack them. Under employment law, workers have the right to walk off the job to protect themselves from ""serious and imminent"" danger, he says. Firms may think they are enforcing social distancing rules, but ""no employer can police a workplace properly,"" he adds. There are 1.5 million people in England classified as being at high-risk, including those who have received organ transplants or are on immunosuppression drugs. Employers must be ""especially careful"" to protect such people, says Tom Neil, senior adviser at arbitration service Acas. This may include varying their responsibilities, or keeping them on furlough until it is safer for them to return. ""Particularly strict"" social distancing rules should be in place to protect those who do return, says Mr Neil. Employers must follow a strict code of measures, which can include: If employees are unhappy and their employer has not addressed their concerns, they should contact their local authority or the Health and Safety Executive, who can force firms to take action. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) says companies should publish risk assessments, so employees know what safety measures are being taken. However, it says that not all firms have done so. ""Employers who fail to keep their workers safe must be fined - and if necessary, shut down, "" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. Many people are afraid that using public transport will expose them to the risk of being infected by coronavirus. Employers are being encouraged to stagger working times, so workers can avoid rush hour. They are being asked to consider parking and bike storage for people who want to drive or cycle. Acas says employers should discuss with returning staff how they will travel to and from work and offer help. At least seven out of 10 UK firms have reported furloughing workers. From July, businesses will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. But when the scheme finishes at the end of October, companies may not be able to pay all their workers and could cut jobs. Companies don't have to keep on employees when furlough ends and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages. But employers could face allegations of discrimination if they only keep on staff who worked through the crisis, says Acas. People with underlying health conditions might be more likely to go on furlough, while the woman in a household is more likely to be the one that stays at home with the children. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if schools are not open and workers cannot get childcare, employers should not expect staff to return. While it is not necessarily legal protection if you refuse to go to work, Mr Johnson said parents and guardians who are unable to return ""must be defended and protected on that basis""."
27,Where can I go on holiday?,"Is it now possible to go on holiday, either in the UK or abroad?","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:10:34 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52646738,"The chance of having a summer holiday seems remote - with many UK tourism businesses still shut and foreign travel difficult because of quarantine rules. What is the latest situation? No - not until the start of July at the earliest. Lockdown restrictions are being eased slowly across the UK, but the tourist industry does not yet have the green light to reopen fully. You'll probably be able to get an ice cream at the seaside - and some restaurants and bars are doing takeaway food and drink - but hotels remain closed to all guests, except for a small number of specific groups. Government advice in England says businesses providing holiday accommodation - including hotels, campsites, caravan parks and short-term lets - should stay closed for leisure-related trips. No person should stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose, it adds. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he's keen get the tourism sector going as ""rapidly as possible"" with the government sticking to what it describes as an ""ambitious target"" to get England's tourism sector back by 4 July - ""as long as it is safe to do so"". ""Self-contained accommodation has a lower risk than other areas,"" Mr Dowden told the House of Commons. ""I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue."" Hotels in Northern Ireland already have a confirmed date for reopening - Monday 20 July. Zoos and animal parks are shut, as are many national parks. Facilities such as car parks and toilets may not be open either. People are also being urged not to rush to beauty spots such as the Lake District. Visit Cornwall says that people should not travel to the area unless they can return home within 90 minutes. In addition, people who live in England cannot travel for recreation into Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. At the moment, it's difficult. British nationals are still being urged not to take any non-essential foreign travel. This means you are unlikely to get travel insurance, because insurers take their cue from the official advice. But the airlines are hopeful for the summer season. EasyJet plans to resume some flights this month, while Ryanair and British Airways plan to ramp up their services in July. On 15 June the European Union lifted travel restrictions, leaving it to individual countries to decide if they're ready for tourists. Some, including France, Germany, Italy and Portugal are now welcoming travellers from the UK. Others, including Ireland and the Netherlands will force visitors to quarantine for 14 days upon entry. Greece is open, but tourists will have to be tested for coronavirus upon arrival. Anybody testing positive will have to quarantine for 14 days. British holidaymakers are currently unable to enter Australia, India and the US. They will also have to spend two weeks quarantined in a hotel upon arrival if they wish to visit New Zealand. Most travellers will also have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return to the UK. UK aviation bosses are hoping a large number of so called ""air bridges"" will be in place by 29 June, when the UK travel quarantine measures are set to be reviewed. These would exempt travellers from quarantine, if they move between countries with low virus levels. Again, it's impossible to say at this stage. Travel advice will need to have been updated, but it depends on the disease's progress. If your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled, then you are are entitled to a full cash refund. However, lots of people have been struggling to get their money back, and have been offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead. If you are offered a voucher, or a free rebooking instead of cash, you can accept or refuse it. But if the airline later folds, the voucher may no longer be valid. If your airline or holiday company hasn't cancelled your holiday yet, but you no longer wish to travel, you may not be entitled to a refund. However, some providers are allowing people to rebook trips for a later date at no cost. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"

US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. The US has by far the largest number of cases - now more than two million and about 25% of the global total - according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by Brazil and the UK. In China, the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average. Due to revisions in the number of cases, an average cannot be calculated for this date. Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data Figures last updated: 16 June 2020, 16:37 BST The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and says people should be prepared for new outbreaks, especially in areas where lockdowns are eased.  Globally, at least 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - were living under social distancing measures at the height of the pandemic in Europe, according to the AFP news agency's estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger. While some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise. A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the WHO to say the Americas were the new centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These charts show four countries - Brazil, Mexico, India and Pakistan - where deaths have been on an upward trajectory - as shown by the red lines. Peru, Mexico, Chile, Ecuador and Brazil are among the Latin America countries which have seen widespread outbreaks. Chile has extended its state of catastrophe orders by a further 90 days, to allow the government to continue to enforce quarantine restrictions, while Peru has announced its economy shrunk by 40% in April when compared with April last year. The health crisis continues in Brazil, which has by far the largest population in Latin America. The country now has the second highest official death toll in the world and is recording an average of about 1,000 deaths per day. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the risks of the virus and prioritised the economy in his decision-making, even criticising state governors for introducing regional quarantine measures. Elsewhere, India and Pakistan have both seen the number of infections and deaths rise in recent weeks and the healthcare systems in both countries appear to be under strain. Authorities in the southern Indian city of Chennai are to reimpose a lockdown on Friday after a surge in cases. In Iran there are fears of a second wave of infections. New cases averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous week. China is also dealing with dozens of new cases believed to be connected a Beijing wholesale market, and has imposed lockdown measures on several neighbourhoods. South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent so this could be distorting understanding of how far the virus has spread. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. The UK has reported more than 42,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Europe. Italy has the second highest death toll with about 34,000, while both France and Spain are just below 30,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated. Having been on lockdown to control the spread of the virus, European countries are now beginning to ease restrictions. How and when restrictions are lifted varies from country to country, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a ""slow, steady"" approach. The risk of a second wave of infections requiring European countries to re-impose full lockdowns is moderate to high, according to the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases. With more than two million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded more than 116,000 deaths. The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 30,000 deaths in total, but the number of daily deaths has remained below 100 since late May - down from 1,000 a day in early April. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but most states have now loosened their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. Nationally, the number of new cases has remained steady at around 20,000 a day for several weeks, but the situation is not the same in every state. In recent days, the governors of Oregon and Utah halted plans to ease lockdown restrictions, citing local spikes in infections. Authorities in Arizona, Florida and Texas have also reported their largest daily increases in coronavirus infections. More than 44 million people - more than a quarter of the country's workforce - have applied for jobless benefits since the pandemic hit. The economic downturn in the US has now been officially declared a recession."
29,Has a second wave of infections hit Iran?,"Iran was one of the worst affected countries early on, so is the virus flaring up again?","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 11:56:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52959756,"Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, sparking fears it might be facing a second wave of the pandemic. Iran started to relax its restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so is it paying the price? New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. The figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. The previous highest figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China. At that time, the Iranian authorities were criticised for their hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites in the Shia holy city of Qom and for not moving quicker to restrict movement. Then, in April, as the number of reported cases dropped to below 1,000 a day, Iran began to ease its restrictions: City transport systems across Iran, as well as banks and offices, have been packed with people. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. There is clearly more social interaction with the easing of restrictions - but officials have suggested the surge in new cases could be down to more testing. President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases. Iran's chief epidemiologist at the country's health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: ""The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms."" It currently does one test for every 79 people, which is up from about one test for every 380 two months ago. However, when you look at the proportion of these tests that are positive, there is a clear upward trend since the middle and end of May after it dropped sharply in April. On 29 May, just under 11% of tests were positive - but by 6 June that figure had risen to over 14%. Health officials have also pointed out the number of daily deaths recorded has been below 100 since mid-April. The daily figure was between 30 and 90 for most of May, but on 14 June it went above 100. This was the first time it had done so in two months. It would take several weeks after the initial rise in infections for an increasing trend in recorded deaths to become apparent. And a report by the Iranian parliament's research centre, published in April, suggested the real death toll could be twice as high as the official number, which comprises deaths in hospitals only. Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. ""People have become completely careless regarding this disease,"" he told the Iranian news agency. ""If our people fail to respect the health protocols... we must prepare ourselves for the worst situation."" And a health ministry poll last week suggested only: What options do the authorities have? President Rouhani has warned restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the outbreak worsens. But the leadership in Tehran does not want to talk about a ""second wave"", even though some officials in other parts of Iran have been warning of one, according to BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour. And she adds that it cannot afford to continue restrictions, because of the state of the economy, which faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement.

30,Coronavirus: What's happening to free school meals this summer?,The government in England will now provide free school meals vouchers over the summer holidays.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:38:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53053337,"The government in England has agreed to extend a voucher scheme for children on free school meals during the summer holidays, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford and others. It had previously insisted the scheme would finish at the end of the summer term.  Scotland and Wales will also continue with the voucher programme. So, who is eligible for free school meals and how do they work? Free school meals have been at least partially funded by the government for more than a century, because of concerns about malnourishment and children being too hungry to concentrate during lessons. Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible, from government-maintained nurseries through to sixth forms. Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. New claims made from April 2018 in England must come from households earning a maximum income of £7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. It's the same in Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland the household income threshold is £14,000 In England and Scotland, all infant state school pupils (those in Reception and in Years 1 and 2) can get free school meals during term time. If a child qualifies for school meals they remain eligible until they finish the phase of school they're in as of 31 March 2022, whether primary or secondary. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of state-educated pupils. In Manchester, where Marcus Rashford grew up, the figure is 28.1% The take-up was greatest in parts of London, the north of England and the Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were receiving free school meals. The majority of children have not been at school during the coronavirus pandemic. This has prompted concerns that those eligible for free school meals could ""fall through the cracks"" and go hungry. In recent years, free school meals have been linked to lowering obesity levels, and boosting academic achievement for poorer pupils. During term time, the government in England expects schools to support pupils eligible for free school meals through an alternative scheme, such as: Many families have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth £15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. But the system has suffered problems including schools struggling to log on, parents being unable to download vouchers and some saying the vouchers failed when they tried to use them. The programme, which has cost more than £129m since lockdown began, also ran throughout the Easter and May half-term holidays. Calling for the government in England to change its decision, Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford said his family had once relied on free school meals. ""The system isn't built for families like mine to succeed,"" he said. Campaigners had also threatened legal action against the government if it didn't extend the food voucher scheme. Reversing the decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". A ""Covid summer food fund"" will now offer six-week food vouchers to children eligible for free school meals in England during the holidays."
31,Coronavirus: Who should wear a face mask or face covering?,Face coverings are becoming compulsory for people using public transport in England.,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 16:12:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,"Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - will be compulsory in England from Monday. This is in line with new World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering from Monday - to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The new rules coincide with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class of some secondary school pupils and the reopening of non-essential shops. The number of people using public transport is expected to increase. The government stresses people should: Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules including: If it is ""reasonably necessary"" for you to eat or drink you can remove the face covering to do so. The rules will apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry will ask people to cover their face as they enter a station. People could be refused travel if they don't follow the rules. They could also be fined, but this will be the last resort. Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory. Similar advice has been given by Northern Ireland's first minister and deputy first minister. In Scotland, it is recommended you consider using face coverings in limited circumstances - such as public transport - as a precautionary measure. The government has been careful to use the term ""face covering"" rather than ""face mask"". Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home"" - with surgical masks kept for medical use. Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings. The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings from Monday - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary. NHS England has now lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts. Health staff already wear masks in clinical areas within 2m (6ft) of a patient - but they will now have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments. It says they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"". The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments. The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them. Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease. There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice."
32,Coronavirus UK map: How many confirmed cases are there in your area?,Key graphics explaining how coronavirus has spread in the UK and the government's response.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:18:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,"There have been nearly 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS) show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. Death certificates mentioning the virus suggest there had been more than 50,000 deaths by 5 June, according to ONS figures. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for this time of year, the toll rises to more than 64,000 by the same date. Some of these deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Coronavirus accounted for about 14% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 5 June, according to death registration data - a drop from 18% the previous week. In the week to 17 April, when deaths from the virus reached their peak, this figure was just under 40%.

The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil. However, the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons. On Tuesday, the government announced a further 184 deaths. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with over 37,000 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. In Scotland, the official government figure for deaths is 2,462, but data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests it had reached nearly 4,070 by 14 June. Both sets of figures show the number of new deaths related to coronavirus in Scotland has been declining for seven weeks. In Wales, the death toll stands at 1,466 while Northern Ireland has recorded 543. Last week's figures from the ONS show that while the number of reported deaths in the UK for the week to 5 June rose slightly, it remains close to the normal range for the time of year. The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. The government says the R number is between 0.8 and 1.0 in most English regions - but between 0.8 and 1.1 in the South West. The estimate for Scotland is between 0.6 and 0.8. In Northern Ireland, it is between 0.5 and 0.9, while it is between 0.7 and 1.0 in Wales. The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. The number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in April but the seven-day rolling average has begun to level off. New cases have been hovering between 1,000 and 1,500 for several days, with a further 1,115 cases announced on Wednesday. The latest ONS estimates suggest there could be some 4,500 cases per day in England alone, not including those in hospitals and care homes. Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance has said the epidemic ""is shrinking, but not fast,"" suggesting this means moving ""very carefully"" out of lockdown. Cases were originally concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but Wales and parts of Scotland and the North East of England have also seen a high proportions of cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the possibility that there could be ""local lockdowns"" in the future to control the spread of the virus. The UK exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. However, the UK Statistics Authority has criticised how the data has been presented, saying the aim appeared to be to show ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he would look at ways the information could be ""improved"". The government announced there were 140,359 tests processed or posted in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Wednesday. This figure does not represent the number of people tested, as some are tested more than once. At least two million people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK - but the government has been unable to provide an updated figure for that since 22 May. Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with NHS England figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has found that people from ethnic minorities have a much higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did not take into account occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. Asked why the government had not released the scientific advice it had received about the risk to black and minority ethnic people, on Monday the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said that the government had ""not got to the bottom of all the evidence"".  He said ministers would wait to formulate a clear view before advising the public. He told the daily press briefing on Monday that ministers would wait to formulate a clear view before advising the public. The most deprived parts of England and Wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas, according to the ONS. Urban areas were worse-affected than rural areas and London had significantly more deaths from coronavirus per 100,000 people than any other region, when standardised for age.

33,What shops are open?,"Non-essential shops have reopened in England, but will I be able to buy a book or have a haircut?","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:24:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52808931,"Non-essential shops have reopened in England, as lockdown restrictions are eased. So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are now throwing open their doors to customers again. They opened in Northern Ireland last week. Many have been announcing their plans: DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Shops which reopen must meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines. These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) are likely to be a regular fixture. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meet social distancing measures. In Northern Ireland, all shops are now allowed to open. In Scotland, smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen in phase two of its lockdown-easing plan. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says it's likely there will be more details on Thursday. Wales's Economy Minister Ken Skates says he would like to see non-essential shops reopen the week of 22 June if coronavirus cases continue to fall. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers £1.8bn a week in lost sales. However, there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birmingham before their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Locker in the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains. Clothing retailers went into lockdown just after stocking up with spring and summer ranges, which they now need to shift."
34,Coronavirus: Could social distancing of less than two metres work?,The government is under pressure to relax the 2m social distancing rule - but is it safe to do so?,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 09:27:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52522460,"A review into the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule has been commissioned by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He faces increasing pressure from his own MPs and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together, to help businesses after they reopen. However, the government's scientific advisers say that being 1m (just over 3ft) apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m. Some countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks. Others, including the UK, have gone further: In a study published in medical journal The Lancet, scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads. They concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Proximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes. But some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If true, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Prof Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out in Chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But the US Centers for Disease Control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is ""currently uncertain"". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. A crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection. The direction of air flow is also crucial - whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you. And a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference. In a restaurant in China, where nine people caught the virus, the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside. Scientists advising the British government say every workplace or building should assess the risks. And they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible, people should only be closer for short periods of time. Plastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time. Arranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help. And in a growing number of many countries, including all parts of the UK, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged, and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But we still don't know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease. Until that is established, the advice is that the risks are real - and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed."
35,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation rules?,Lockdown rules are changing in England aimed at helping single people cut off from family and friends.,"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 12:17:30 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,"England's lockdown restrictions are easing, with changes aimed at reducing loneliness among people who live alone. Each of the four UK nations has different rules. So what can you do now? From Saturday 13 June, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents with children under 18 - can form an ""exclusive"" support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size - but nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They will not have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can stay overnight. It means, for example, that a single grandparent could pair up with one of their children's households. An adult living alone could mix with their parents, or two single friends living apart could get together. If anyone in the bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in both households must self-isolate. If you don't live on your own, or with children under 18 only, then the rules haven't changed for you. In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland, two separate households - up to a recommended maximum of eight people - can meet outdoors, ideally travelling no more than five miles. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles. Beauty spots remain closed. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. In all countries, children are included in the headcount and social distancing guidelines - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - apply. People in England can exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside. So having a kickabout with a football in the park is allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, with social distancing, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Socially-distanced picnics and barbecues could also be possible. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people in England: ""It remains the case that people should not spend time inside the homes of their friends and families, other than to access the garden or use the toilet."" Hand washing and hygiene should remain a priority. If you use the toilet while visiting another home, you should clean any surfaces you have touched. The guidelines in Scotland say that for a barbecue, each household should bring their own food, cutlery and crockery. In Wales, you can eat while out on a walk, run or cycle. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said allowing more people to meet was not an excuse for garden parties. People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible. Another group, of about 2.5 million people, is categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called ""shielding"". Now those people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again - either with members of their household, or by meeting someone else at a social distance. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. Virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should self-isolate - stay at home and not leave it for any reason. Ask others to drop off food and medicines. If England's NHS Test and Trace team contact you because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection.

36,Coronavirus: What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work?,"Nine million people have accessed the scheme, which will move to its next phase in July.","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:19:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342,"Almost nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government. The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies. Firms have to start paying towards the scheme from August, and it will close entirely in October. So, if you've been put on furlough, what are your rights? The Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme puts workers on leave but allows them to stay on their company's payroll. Originally, furloughed employees couldn't do any work for their employer, but from 1 July they can go back to work part-time. For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Those workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. Yes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, or when it ends. If they are entitled to redundancy pay it would be calculated based on the amount they earned before furlough. Firms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service. At present, furloughed staff can't do any work for their employer. From July, they can be brought back to work on a part-time basis, In the meantime, they can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to £2,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. The take-up has been significant, with about 8.9 million workers furloughed since March. Employers had made about £19.6bn of furlough claims by 7 June, and the scheme will cost the government an estimated £80bn in total. The scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. Workers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. Companies can top up this pay and must let employees know they have been furloughed. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at £2,500 per employee per month before tax, or £576.92 a week. If employees' pay varies each month, you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than £50,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is offered as a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of £7,500. Applications for a second grant will open in August. Anyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage."
37,Coronavirus: Which schools are reopening for pupils?,"Which children are going back to school, and what about the rest?","Sun, 14 Jun 2020 13:45:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,"Some secondary school pupils in England are due to return on Monday. Plans shared with the BBC suggest the arrangements vary widely, with many schools offering between five and 30 hours of face-to-face teaching each week. Secondary schools in England can reopen for Years 10 and 12 from Monday. But only a quarter of eligible pupils will be allowed in school at any one time. Students who do return will be encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Plans to get all primary pupils in England back for four weeks before the summer holidays have been dropped. But some nursery and pre-school children - plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - started to go back on 1 June. Not all schools have reopened, some due to local council advice and some because they don't have the staff or space to safely accommodate eligible pupils. Some parents have chosen not to send their children back. On 4 June, 659,000 children in England - or 6.9% - are estimated to have been in classes. Many schools have been open throughout lockdown for vulnerable children and those of critical workers across all year groups. The government has also published guidance for children with special educational needs or a disability. Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June to all age groups - but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Plans in England include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could be different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is ""very, very small, but not zero"", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools are not ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. Many teachers have offered a limited curriculum online, relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. To support home learning, the BBC launched a major programme of educational content on its BBC Bitesize service, including regular daily lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says exams will take place in 2021 in England. ""We are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach to this,"" he told MPs. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection.

38,Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules?,What do you need to know if you're planning to fly during the Covid-19 pandemic?,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:00:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52544307,"A two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK is now being enforced. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move is to protect public health, because imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined £100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate. Passengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. Once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. People returning from overseas will not be automatically eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms. Anyone arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - will not have to enter quarantine, as long as they have been in the CTA for at least 14 days. The government has also said it is looking into international travel corridors or ""air bridges"" to countries with low infection rates and strong healthcare systems. It hopes this could avoid the need for quarantine for travellers between the two. Negotiations are already taking place between the UK and Portugal. However, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel abroad, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end. The measures will be reviewed in late June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''. There are a number of groups who are exempt, including: Travellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Some have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. Quarantine has not been welcomed by the UK's travel industry. Airlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine ""would effectively kill off air travel"". British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have launched a legal challenge against the policy. The British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them ""overzealous"". EasyJet has restarted a limited number of flights to European destinations, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks. Ryanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports. British Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the quarantine rules.

39,Can I stay with my boyfriend now? And other questions,"Questions about support bubbles, and other coronavirus topics","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 23:39:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51176409,"In some parts of the UK, some people are being allowed to have close contact once again with people from outside their household. BBC News answers questions about who can form a ""support bubble"", and other questions about coronavirus. If you and your boyfriend both live alone and in England, the good news is that from 13 June, you can form a support bubble, which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each other’s company, inside or outside a house. You don’t have to keep a 2m distance from one another, and you can stay overnight at each other’s house. If you are living alone, and your partner is in a shared household (or vice versa), matters get complicated. You can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household, and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household. What this means is that if one of your boyfriend’s housemates has a partner who is - like you - living elsewhere and alone, that couple will be prevented from meeting up. Support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone (or alone with children). If both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households, you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other. You cannot form a support bubble with your boyfriend if he lives in Scotland or Wales, although Northern Ireland has announced that it is also introducing support bubbles from 13 June.. As a single grandparent, you will have the right to form a “support bubble” with your grandson and his family. Under the government’s new guidance, from 13 June your grandson would be able to stay at your home, including overnight, and would not need to keep a 2m distance. However, the complicating factor here is your lodger. Are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other, and are you using separate rooms and facilities? If the answer is yes, then there should be no problem. On the other hand, if you have been using the same kitchen, living room and bathroom, and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger, then you are both effectively part of the same household, and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble. There is no current date for reopening tattoo parlours in the UK, and the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union (TPIU) says it has not received any guidance from the government on when this might happen. In the official guidance on which businesses must stay closed for the present, tattoo parlours are listed in the category of personal care, alongside hairdressers, barbers and beauty and nail salons. Under the plans for easing lockdown, 4 July is the earliest date on which personal care outlets could be allowed to reopen in England. There is no set date in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Extra hygiene measures are certain to be put in place as a condition of reopening - the TPIU says these are likely to include “masks for everyone, visors/goggles for artists and paying more attention to more thorough cleaning between customers and regularly throughout the day”. Caravan parks were told to close at the end of March, along with hotels, B&Bs and other types of holiday accommodation. Although some aspects of the lockdowns, people are still not supposed to stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose. The only exception to this rule is for people for whom a static caravan is their home. The government has said it wants to get England’s tourism sector running again from 4 July onwards “as long as it is safe to do so” but has not released any details of how this will happen. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that self-contained accommodation had a lower risk than other areas, and said, ""I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue."" The situation is clearer in Northern Ireland, where static caravans will be open for business  from 20 July onwards. In Scotland, the tourism industry has been given a conditional date of 15 July for reopening. Caravan parks are currently set to stay closed in Wales until 26 September although the Welsh government is reviewing the situation every three weeks. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford’s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it “probably is likely” that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the “incubation period” - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home. For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many ""silent spreaders"" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many ""silent carriers"" there may be. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you’re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn’t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose – and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. If you’re living with someone who’s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. ""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."" It’s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It’s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There’s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK’s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will ""remain unprecedented"" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to ""long waiters"", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to “pre-Covid-19 levels”. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don’t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don’t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government’s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that ""infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general”. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are ""no restrictions"" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: ""Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes."" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may ""vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe"", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. It depends on a number of factors. ""Typical"" business trips to Germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out ""essential functions"" such as healthcare. A certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case. With the introduction of quarantine restrictions at UK borders from 8 June, returning to the UK will not as straightforward. Anyone entering the UK from that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. There are a number of exemptions to this rule, including UK residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you’re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it’s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. If you’re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of £2,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than £50,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of £7,500. In August, applications will open for a ""second and final"" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of £2,190 a month for another three months (£6,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job ""absolutely cannot be done from home"". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren’t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can’t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth £95.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. The government says that this plan is still on course. At the beginning of lockdown, the government promised to provide laptops and tablets for disadvantaged children and young people, so that they would not fall behind in online learning organised by their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on the Education Select Committee that 200,000 laptops would be delivered, some at the end of May, but most of them in June. On 9 June Mr Williamson told the House of Commons that 100,000 laptops had been distributed, prioritising children who have social workers, and that the government was on schedule to distribute all the computers over the coming month. However, he faced criticism from the opposition that the roll-out was taking too long. Labour MP Meg Hillier said that it was “already late for vulnerable pupils, and with no clear plan about catch-up”. Separate schemes to provide vulnerable children and adults with laptops have been announced in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Although the government has changed its advice on the use of face coverings in public places, it still recommends that face masks or face coverings should not be worn in schools. It adds that face coverings should not be worn in any circumstances by those who are not able to handle them properly (for example, small children or those with special educational needs or disabilities), as they may “inadvertently increase the risk of transmission”. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, told the Times Educational Supplement that face coverings could also have a bad effect on the mental health of some children: “If compulsory masking is going to tip some kids into a bad space after weeks of stressful lockdown, we need to balance that risk with the potential benefits.” Meanwhile, other countries have taken different approaches when reopening schools. In France, for example, face masks are compulsory for teachers and pupils aged 11 and over, but they are not worn in Denmark. There are no current plans to open schools for most pupils during the summer holidays, but the situation varies across the UK. In England, some Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children have gone back, but the government has dropped plans for all primary school pupils to return before the summer. Similarly, some Year 10 and Year 12 students in England will go back from 15 June, but the government has confirmed that secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June for all age groups, but only a third of pupils will be in class at any one time. The summer term has been extended by a week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland won’t be returning until after the summer holidays in August. Across the UK, some vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have been in school throughout the crisis, including during the Easter holidays, but it is not yet clear whether that provision will continue over the summer break. Playgrounds are still closed in England. The next review of lockdown easing is due towards the end of the month, so changes may be considered then. In Scotland, playgrounds are set to reopen from 18 June, when the country moves into phase two of its lockdown-easing plans. There is no date yet for reopening in Wales, while there is no detail on this in Northern Ireland’s recovery plan - but decisions will be delegated to councils, as they are responsible for playgrounds. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you “absolute clarity” on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are “unable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms”. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it’s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a “completions procedure form” from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you’re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a “break clause” which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don’t have a “break clause”, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a “reduced payment plan”. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, “provided they are safe and enforce social distancing”. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: ""We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,"" he said. ""So we are talking about really large numbers of people."" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who’s leading the Church’s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you’re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you’ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you’ve shared a bus or train carriage. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you don’t have to go into quarantine if you’re returning to the UK from what’s known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the ""Dublin dodge"") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt. The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland. The government guidance details what you’ll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work you’ll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you. However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands. Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. What questions do you have about coronavirus?

40,Coronavirus: Five ways shopping will be different from now on,"Shops in England are preparing to welcome customers back but what will the ""new normal"" look like?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 21:01:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53005123,"On Monday, non-essential shops in England will be allowed to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed. This includes retailers offering clothes, toys, books, furniture and electronics. For many people stuck indoors for weeks, it will be a welcome change of scene. But with hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, shopping will not be like it was before 23 March. Here are five ways it will be different from next week. We've all seen the 2m markings and arrows on the floor in supermarkets showing customers how far apart they need to stay and which way to walk, and this will now be the case in other non-essential stores too. People will also be asked to keep a set distance between each other on escalators. At John Lewis, for example, shoppers will be required to stand eight steps behind each other. And only one person at a time will be allowed to use a lift at the department store, unless they are from the same household. At Primark, two people can use a lift but only if they stand on designated spots. There will be hand sanitising stations throughout shops and people will be encouraged to use hand gel when they enter a shop. Shop assistants will look different as well. At Next, employees will wear a protective visor and have the option of wearing an additional mouth and nose mask. Many retailers are also fitting plastic screens at tills. And there will be a lot more cleaning going on - of shopping baskets, door handles, counters and escalator rails. Selfridges is one of the few retailers that will allow people to try clothes on but each fitting room will be sanitised by steaming and antibacterial cleaning after each customer use. Government guidelines recommend people should shop alone where possible so hopes of hitting the stores with friends will have to wait. Some retailers, such as Primark, will allow a group of people into their shops from Monday but they must be from the same household. They will also have to follow social distancing rules once they are inside the branch. Dan Simms, co-head of the UK retail agency team at Colliers International, reckons ""the younger demographic will take advantage of the lifting of restrictions to socialise and visit retail destinations"". But that is not expected to happen immediately from Monday as at the moment six people from different households are only allowed to meet outside. And some shopping malls, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre and others owned by Intu, have removed indoor seating areas to ""support social distancing"" and ""to discourage people from gathering"". Meanwhile, stopping for a coffee with a friend or sitting down for a bite to eat will be limited because some stores will not reopen their in-house cafes or restaurants. The British Retail Consortium's guidance is that customers should be discouraged from handling products that they're not going to buy. But the policy very much varies from retailer to retailer. At Selfridges, shoppers can try on shoes and the footwear will be sanitised afterwards. Kurt Geiger will also allow people to try on shoes - provided they use anti-bacterial hand gel first as well as a pop sock - but then the footwear will be placed in quarantine for 12 hours. But at H&M, people will not be allowed to try on footwear at all. It is the same for clothing. At Next, for example, customers can handle clothes but at Selfridges, shoppers will be asked not to touch items unless they intend to buy them. If they do, the garment will be quarantined for 72 hours. This is based on government guidance that the risk of infection from coronavirus on a surface is likely to be ""reduced significantly"" after a three-day period. The majority of retailers will close their changing rooms and goods returned will be quarantined for 72 hours. Some shops will also offer contactless returns. At Primark, customers will present the item they want to return to a staff member at a till, complete with their receipt which will be scanned. People will receive their refund and take their item to a returns section where it will be held for 72 hours before going back on the shop floor. At Waterstone's, that three-day rule will also apply to books that customers browse through in store, which will allow them to ""self-heal"", according to chief executive James Daunt. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people will not be allowed to handle makeup or sniff a perfume bottle. But picking things up in a shop might be a hard habit to break for some, says consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale. ""There will be this almost automatic behaviour of your muscles where you want to touch something,"" she says. ""But then you're in the middle of the flow of your hand to the counter [and] you will remind yourself, 'No, I can't.'"" And this can create other problems. Conventional wisdom suggests everyone will be delighted to get out of the house and treat themselves to a day's shopping from Monday. Not quite, says Ms Nightingale. Restrictions in shops, such as not touching items or being told which direction to walk in is likely to frustrate people already experiencing anxiety since lockdown was enforced on 23 March. ""We are basically living in a constant state of fear and anxiety - don't leave the house, don't touch anyone, don't do exactly what you were doing before - this is not a normal way of human behaviour,"" says Ms Nightingale. That means people will be going back to shops after more than three months ""with a pre-existing huge ball of negativity in our head, whether we want it or not"". Even the smallest things can cause grumpiness. At HMV, which has already reopened stores in Canada and the US, shoppers are asked to sanitise their hands before handling any merchandise. ""There are confrontations in stores about it,"" Doug Putman, the owner of HMV, told the BBC. ""For some customers, they are very comfortable, for [others], they are a little less comfortable. And I think it just comes down to your personality type."" On the whole, though, he expects people will do their bit. ""What you've got is an overall public sentiment that even if you don't believe that you should have to sanitise and this and that, you're going to do it because it is the right thing."" Much like supermarkets, retailers will ask shoppers to queue to prevent overcrowding in stores and allow people to maintain 2m social distancing. To relieve the tedium, some department store Selfridges will employ DJs to help make it a more ""joyful experience"". It may also take longer to pay for your shopping as some retailers will close every other cashier to prevent people being in close proximity to each other. People may also have to wait for their favourite shop to even open in the first place. While retailers like Primark will open 153 stores in England on Monday, John Lewis is initially only reopening two sites, at Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames. It intends to reopen 11 more stores the following week. Stores are being chosen on the proviso they are easily accessible by car, ""therefore reducing the reliance on public transport for partners and customers""."
41,Coronavirus bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours?,"The first ""support bubbles"" of people who can meet indoors has been announced in England and Northern Ireland.","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 11:51:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52637354,"As lockdown restrictions are eased further, people in England and Northern Ireland can now set up support bubbles. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. From Saturday, in England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size. Nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. The independent advisory group Sage has been asked to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubbles. The idea was introduced in New Zealand and is being considered by the Scottish government. Support bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They won't have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can even stay overnight. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. There is no limit on how far you can travel in England for your support bubble but local is best, the government says. You can't bubble with anyone in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. However, if you are single and live alone in Northern Ireland you can bubble with another household. Social and family groups are complicated and might not fit bubble rules. Grandparents: Single parents: If you are single: You can read the government's guidelines in full here. If you don't live on your own, or you are not a single parent whose children are under 18, then the rules haven't changed. However, you can, of course, invite someone eligible to join a social bubble with your household. Otherwise, you must meet people you don't live with outside. The number of people you are allowed to meet depends on where in the UK you live. Basically, when people mix - especially in crowded places - coronavirus can spread. The virus is transmitted by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. That's why people have been asked to maintain social distancing when meeting anyone not from their household. Bubbles allow some people more contact with others, while keeping other social distancing measures in place. Who will be in your social bubble?

42,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,Loss of taste and smell have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 19:53:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,"The NHS has listed three main symptoms of coronavirus, that people should be aware of and ready to act upon. If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus. Follow James on Twitter.

43,Coronavirus: What is a recession?,The world faces the worst recession for 80 years. But what does that mean?,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:14:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52986863,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls. A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. If a recession carries on for a long time, or is particularly bad, it is known as a depression. For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls. This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession. In the UK, the economy shrank by 2% from January to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. It then shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - in its first full month in lockdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK. In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts. The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer. It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid. The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be. If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back. So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come. A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery. But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend. But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further. Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come."
44,Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England?,People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced.,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 10:50:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754,"People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. The NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. An app is also being developed, although its launch has been delayed. The hope is that contact tracing will avoid the need for national lockdowns, with more local restrictions used instead. Anyone in England with coronavirus symptoms can now get a test. If it's positive you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: The contact must have taken place between two days before and up to seven days after symptoms appeared. No-one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. Manual tracing was meant to be launched in mid-May, in tandem with an app that would automatically alert users if they have been in contact with another user with coronavirus. The manual element launched in England on 28 May.  The app is still being trialled on the Isle of Wight and hasn't been released more widely, although business minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested it would be in place by the end of June. At the government's briefing on Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government wanted to be ""confident people are following the advice given by human beings"" before the app was introduced. Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, and has recruited 2,000 contact tracers. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop the danger of the virus spreading. You should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine and live alone, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. If you live with other people they won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said England's tracing system would be ""world-beating"". On launch, the government claimed the tracers could track down the contacts of 10,000 people every day. There were 8,117 people testing positive referred to the scheme in its first week, but just 5,407 of those provided details of recent contacts. Those people provided 31,794 contacts, 26,985 of whom were reached and agreed to self-isolate. The government says some people who tested positive couldn't be reached either because their contact details were unavailable or incorrect or they didn't respond to attempts to get in touch. When recent contacts were given, in some cases those details were incorrect,  or contacts either did not respond or refused to self-isolate. Over three-quarters of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate within 24 hours. Baroness Dido Harding, who is leading England's track and trace system, said: ""We clearly have more to do make sure we reach everyone and more to do to speed up the end to end service."" The NHS Test and Trace service will not ask you: England's Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the tracers will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. It's currently voluntary, but the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply ""we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures, for example making visits to check they're home or issuing fines if they are found outside the house"". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer. Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) is £95.85 per week and paid by your employer for every day you are in isolation, as long as you meet the eligibility conditions."
45,"Coronavirus: When will pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants reopen?","Pubs and restaurants in England are expected to reopen in July, but can I meet a friend for a meal?","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 10:07:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52977388,"Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in England may soon be able to reopen their doors for the first time since lockdown began in March. But despite the easing of restrictions, a trip to a local bar or dining establishment could be a very different experience from how it was before coronavirus. In its recovery strategy document published on 11 May, the government said that the hospitality sector - which includes pubs, bars and restaurants - could start to reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"", if Covid-19 safety guidelines could be met. The government has yet to announce details of what these guidelines would be, but they're expected to include rules on social distancing, heightened hygiene procedures and protection of bar and restaurant staff. It will provide ""further safer working guidance"" for restaurants, pubs and bars ""as soon as we can"", Business Secretary Alok Sharma said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. On 20 March, all pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes were asked to shut in order to stop the spread of coronavirus The only exceptions to this were cafes and canteens at a few selected places such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Since then, many restaurants have started offering food delivery and takeaways in order to generate income while their doors are closed. Some pubs have also been allowed to offer takeaway beers. Each nation of the UK is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: The chief worry for many people in the hospitality industry is the issue of social distancing. Some have insisted that the current 2m distancing rule makes it impossible for bars, cafes and restaurants to make a profit. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the industry body UK Hospitality, says that with a 2m rule, outlets would be only able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would increase that to 60-75%. Some Conservative MPs have added their support for reducing social distancing, and the prime minister said on 10 June that the 2m rule was ""under constant review"". The Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca says it is considering a range of measures to keep staff and workers safe amid the pandemic. Customers are likely to be given the option of ordering food on apps, while staff will be encouraged to wash their hands every 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the Wetherspoons pub chain has said its staff will be provided with face masks and protective eyewear and it will run a reduced food menu. Bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise will be replaced by individual sachets. Customers will also be encouraged to sit outside in pub gardens, while some indoor seating areas will be separated by Perspex screens. The hospitality sector was the third-largest employer in the country in 2018, according to UK Hospitality. But many restaurants and cafes were already struggling even before the Covid-19 outbreak, in the face of rising rents and falling consumer spending. Since lockdown began, job cuts and closures have been announced by chains such as Frankie & Benny's and Carluccio's.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs £130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant Thousands of workers in the industry have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, which allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500. Many other countries have already reopened restaurants, bars and cafes around the world. In some cases they have had the use of lower social distancing recommendations - in France, for example, the recommended distance between customer and staff is 1m."
46,All you need to know about new measures,How will social and work life be different after the easing of some restrictions around the UK?,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:10:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518,"Lockdown measures are being eased further after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England from Saturday, households containing one person, or one adult and children, can form a ''support bubble'' with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. People can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. In Scotland, eight people from two different households can now meet up outdoors if they maintain social distancing. It is recommended that eight is the maximum group size and that people do not meet more than one other household per day. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors. Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although up to 10 people can now attend outdoor weddings and civil partnerships. In all four nations, permitted numbers of people includes children, and social distancing - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others - should be followed unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble.  The rules are different for people who are shielding. The overall advice remains ""stay at home"" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. This means, for example, that having a kickabout with a football in the park is now allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart and practise good hand hygiene. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis are all allowed in England. Tennis, can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland - but not yet in Wales. However, golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should still not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. Wales and Scotland do not want households to travel more than five miles if possible, but 11 Conservative MPs have questioned the Wales decision. The Northern Ireland Executive has confirmed that hotels and tourist accommodation can reopen on 20 July. Most people entering the UK - including British citizens - now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. They should also consider wearing gloves and a face covering - which some UK airports and airlines have made compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so ""for the foreseeable future"". People who must travel to their workplace are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive if possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport, on which they are likely to face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport will be mandatory in England from 15 June. Read the government advice in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now spend some time outdoors again. Those with families can go out once a day with members of their own household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can now go outdoors. In Scotland, ""adjustments"" are anticipated in the coming weeks to the shielding guidelines. House moves and viewings have resumed again in England. Potential buyers and renters are able to visit show homes and view houses on the market to let or buy. Anyone who has already bought a new home can visit it to prepare for moving in. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. However, the government's plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term is now being dropped. Instead, schools will be given ""flexibility"" over whether or not to admit more pupils. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. From 15 June in England, the government says secondary schools and further education colleges will be able to have face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their ""continued remote, home learning"". However, at the Downing Street briefing on Monday 8 June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - can reopen in England from 15 June, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can now reopen if they are ""Covid-secure"". Garden centres are now back open across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Zoos, safari parks, drive-in cinemas and other outdoor attractions are expected to be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June - as long as they follow social distancing rules. Places of worship will also be allowed to reopen for private prayer shortly although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will open from 4 July at the earliest in England, as long as they can meet social distancing measures. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later"", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

47,Coronavirus: Five unanswered questions on the travel quarantine rules,Travellers to the UK now have to self-isolate for 14 days. But how will the rules work in practice?,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 12:05:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52963306,"Most people entering the UK from overseas are now expected to self-isolate for 14 days. But there are still questions about how quarantine will be enforced and why it has been implemented now. Under the new rules, most travellers entering the UK by land, air or sea must complete an online form in the 48 hours before they arrive, stating where they will be staying in the UK while self-isolating and how they can be contacted. They could be fined £100 for not filling in the form, while there is a fine of up to £1,000 in England for those who are found to be not complying with the self-isolation rules. However, when filling in this ""contact locator"" form, travellers are given the option to not put down an address at all, or to put down more than one. The Home Office says that if someone arrives without a place to stay, then they will have to book accommodation at their own expense at a list of hotels provided, using its bookings system. One reason people can put down more than one address is in case they need to stay in a hotel before moving on to their ultimate destination, or are legally obliged to change addresses, it adds, for example due to a court order. Guidance for border officials, seen by the BBC, indicates that unless the port of entry is particularly quiet, it is likely only ""spot checks"" will be used to see if passengers have filled out the forms. The guidance states that border staff will generally have no way of checking whether addresses are real. They are advised to accept the information given unless other factors suggest there are ""credibility concerns"" - for example ""stating that their name is Mickey Mouse or that their address is Buckingham Palace"". Public Health England (PHE) says it will contact 20% of those required to self-isolate via a phone call and text message. If they have reason to suspect that somebody isn't complying, then their details can ultimately be passed to police who will enforce the measures as a last resort. However, the Home Office says police do not have a right to enter someone's home on the basis of this offence. What's more, there are several reasons why someone is permitted to not be at an address, for example if they need to buy essential supplies and have no-one to do this for them. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the decision to bring in a travel quarantine system now is ""guided by science"", as UK transmission (or the spread of the virus) is low enough for imported cases to potentially cause a ""devastating second wave"". Prof John Aston, the Home Office's chief scientific adviser, says the ""scientific advice so far is clear"" that the impact of the policy would have been ""negligible"" while transmission rates were higher. ""As the number of infections within the UK drops, we must now manage the risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere,"" he says. However, some have questioned the decision to bring in quarantine measures now, when the UK has a higher transmission rate than many other countries. Conservative MP Sir Liam Fox said in the House of Commons last week: ''If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak, and if it is a contingency measure against a so-called second wave, why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have?"" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, suggests bringing in the policy ""would have had some effect"" during the ""containment phase"" of the virus response back in February. But he argues that bringing it in now ""won't have any measurable impact on public health whatsoever"". In late February and early March, the government did advise passengers from affected areas, such as Wuhan in China and parts of Italy, to self-isolate when arriving in the UK, but this policy was dropped on 13 March. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said at the government's coronavirus press conference that ""measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and applied to countries with higher rates"". There was some confusion over whether these travel quarantine rules would apply to the whole of the UK, because border security is a centralised measure, while health is devolved - meaning England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own rules. Ultimately the measure was brought in as part of the Public Health Act, so when the UK government decided to introduce quarantine rules on 3 June they were for England only. All home nations have now made it a requirement for travellers from abroad to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the UK. But they could choose to end the policy at different times, or to vary the rules. For example, workers providing essential healthcare will have to quarantine upon arrival in Scotland but not in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The level of fines issued for breaking the rules also vary. In Scotland, if someone fails to self-isolate for 14 days at a fixed address they will be fined £480, while in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it's £1,000. In England, an individual will be fined £100 for not filling out the contact locator form correctly. In the rest of the UK the fine is £60, falling to £30 if paid promptly. There has been a lot of discussion about so-called ""air bridges"", which could allow visitors from countries with low coronavirus transmission rates to enter the UK without having to self-isolate. For an air bridge to open, two countries would have to agree to relax quarantine restrictions. So far, Portugal is the only country offering to open an air bridge to the UK. Sources close to the government have told the BBC that the Department for Transport is keen to open air bridges by the end of the month. ""Quash the quarantine"", a lobbying group of more than 500 travel and hospitality companies, says it has been given ""private assurances"" from senior government sources that travel corridors - which encompass land, air and sea borders - will be in place by that time.

48,When can I ride an e-scooter legally?,"With people told to avoid public transport, the government's hoping to trial e-scooter rental schemes.","Wed, 10 Jun 2020 08:40:49 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48106617,"With people told to avoid public transport, the government's hoping to trial e-scooter rental schemes - possibly by the end of June. But what are e-scooters and where can they be used? They're two-wheeled scooters with small, electric motors. Their popularity has grown and scooter-sharing schemes now operate in more than 100 cities around the world - including San Francisco, Paris and Copenhagen. People can hire e-scooters, often using smartphone apps, in a way similar to city centre bicycle hire schemes. Electric scooters are freely available to buy in the UK online and in stores, and they cost anywhere from just over £100 to more than £1000. Currently, you can buy one but you can't ride it on a UK public road, cycle lane or pavement. Anyone who does is committing an offence. The only place an e-scooter can be used is on private land, with the permission of the landowner. At the moment, they are classified as Personal Light Electric Vehicles (PLEVs), so they're treated as motor vehicles and are subject to all the same legal requirements - MOT, tax, licensing and specific construction. So, because they don't always have visible rear red lights, number plates or signalling ability, they can't be used legally on the roads. The law covering e-bikes - which are battery-assisted pedal cycles - doesn't currently cover e-scooters, but the government wants to regulate them in a similar way in future. Normal scooters, those without motors, are not allowed on pavements or cycle paths - but they can be used on roads. The Department for Transport wants e-scooters rental schemes - similar to those seen in European cities - tried out across England, Wales and Scotland. Riders wouldn't need to take out their own insurance to hire an e-scooter, but they would need a driving licence or at least provisional one. The hired vehicles could be used - legally - within set geographical boundaries. But it would still be illegal to use a privately-owned e-scooter on a public road, even if you were in a trial area. The government says it will monitor safety and keep the year-long scheme - part of a £2 billion plan to invest in greener travel - under review. We don't know at the moment. As well as bringing forward the start date to the end of June, the government has - in light of the coronavirus crisis - widened the scope of the scheme across the whole of Great Britain. Initially, four ""future transport zones"" were chosen for the trials - the West Midlands; Portsmouth and Southampton; the West of England Combined Authority (Bristol, Bath and surrounding areas); and Derby and Nottingham. The Department for Transport says: ""A high number of areas across Great Britain have expressed an interest in running e-scooter trials."" If you were to use a hired e-scooter outside of any of the trial areas - yes, you could be fined. Likewise, if you use a privately-owned e-scooter on any public road, cycle lane or pavement. You could get a £300 fixed-penalty notice and, if you have one, six points on your driving licence. Electric scooters can exceed 30mph (48.3km/h), although many are limited to 15.5mph (24.9km/h). Television presenter Emily Hartridge is believed to be the first person to die in an accident involving an electric scooter in the UK. There are no official tallies on global deaths and injuries, but there have been a number of studies: Some e-scooters have only a single brake, which makes stopping safely more difficult. There are strong advocates for the introduction of electric scooters in the UK. The London Cycle Campaign (LCC) said: ""The arrival of e-scooters offers a cleaner, low carbon alternative to cars and buses for those who can't or don't want to cycle."" ""LCC is calling for e-scooters to be legalised and allowed to use cycle tracks rather than be used on pavements."" The BBC is not responsible for the content of external Internet sites"
49,Coronavirus: What tests are being done in the UK?,"What are the tests for coronavirus, who are they for and how do they work?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 16:20:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51943612,"Testing will be vital to controlling coronavirus outbreaks as lockdown eases. The government says tests are now available to anyone with symptoms, and it aims to process tests within 24 hours by the end of June. In England and Wales you can apply for a swab test for yourself, or for anyone in your household, if you or they have symptoms In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff. Couriers collect samples and take them to laboratories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June, except where there were difficulties with the post. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of the Test and Trace service, has previously said 84% of drive-in centre tests come back within a day. No figure has been provided for home kits. Speed is important because delays give the virus more time to spread. Scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, the stage of infection someone's at when tested, or problems in the lab. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, has called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Testing is essential if contact-tracing systems now in place across the UK are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. And in theory it can help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. But representatives of hospital trusts and care home providers say staff need to be tested regularly, not as a one-off, to ensure this. Testing can also let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On 7 June, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes, some of which may never be returned. It also includes tests carried out as part of a surveillance study by the Office for National Statistics, which don't serve the purpose of diagnosing individuals. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test didn't work. A government spokesperson said it was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to ""increase transparency"". There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

50,Can thermal cameras help spot coronavirus?,"The devices allow a person's temperature to be checked from a distance, but are not always reliable.","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:48:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52940951,"As lockdowns ease, thermal imaging cameras are popping up in all sorts of public places to assess the state of people's health. Using infrared technology, thermal cameras detect radiating heat from a body - usually from the forehead - and then estimate core body temperature. These cameras are an extremely powerful tool, often deployed by fire fighters to track smouldering embers and police to search for out-of-sight suspects. But they are not designed to be medical devices. So how useful are they in the current pandemic? They can give a reasonable measure of skin temperature, to within half a degree - but that's not the same as body temperature. ""These devices, in general, are less accurate than medical device thermometers like those you stick in the ear,"" says Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science from University College London. About 37C (98.6F). A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or over. But normal temperature can vary from person to person and change during the day. It can also fluctuate during a woman's monthly cycle. Taking an accurate reading of core body temperature isn't easy. Although it can be measured on the forehead, in the mouth, the ear and the armpit, the most accurate way is to take a rectal reading.  37°C(98.6°F) normal body temperature 38°C(100.4°F) or above, high temperature/fever No, they only measure temperature. A high temperature or fever is just one common symptom of the virus. Others include nausea, headaches, fatigue and loss of taste or smell. But not everyone with the virus gets a high temperature and not everyone with a high temperature is infected with coronavirus. So thermal cameras alone will miss infected people with other symptoms or no symptoms at all - known as false negatives. They will also identify people unwell with a fever for another reason - known as false positives. On its own, temperature screening ""may not be very effective"" says the World Health Organization. Cameras have to be set up correctly and take account of ambient temperature. A risk is that cameras can lull operators into a false sense of security. ""They are… only one tool among many,"" says James Ferryman, professor of computational vision, from the University of Reading. ""Heat radiating from the skin will likely be impacted by wearing face masks,"" says Prof Ferryman. That's why most temperature measurements are based on the forehead, which is usually exposed. Not necessarily. Skin temperature actually goes down during exercise as sweat appears on the surface of the skin. The body is pretty good at regulating its temperature even after exercise, so it would have to be really quite high to show up. With portable thermometers pointed at foreheads. They don't need to touch the skin, but do need to be within a few centimetres of it. While accurate to a fraction of a degree on skin temperature, they correctly detect fever about 90% of the time compared with a rectal thermometer, Prof Hill says. Thermal scanners are now in place at some UK airports - including Bournemouth. Temperature screening is being trialled for some passengers at Heathrow, while Manchester Airport says equipment is also being tested - but results will not be communicated to passengers or ""used to influence whether a customer can travel"". Portsmouth international ferry port has also installed a thermal scanner to screen departing passengers. Schools are deploying hand-held laser thermometers to check children each morning. And some employers are looking at introducing staff-testing in workplaces. Under UK employment law, individuals must agree before an employer can temperature-screen members of staff. Some work contracts will already allow for this type of test to be carried out, by so-called ""implied consent"". If employees do not consent - and there is no pre-agreed policy covering the situation - then taking someone's temperature is unlawful, says the professional body for HR and people development. Employers must also handle the medical information they gather fairly and transparently - according to the Information Commissioner. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
51,Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask,Our guide to different types of face coverings and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 16:22:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52609777,"People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.

52,Coronavirus: Are protests legal amid lockdown?,Black Lives Matter protests continue in the UK - but are they illegal under restrictions on gatherings?,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 11:27:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52909814,"Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with this rave in the West Midlands last month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at £100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets."
53,Coronavirus: What are the rules on weddings?,There is a lot of uncertainty around when and how weddings are allowed to take place. What are your rights?,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:20:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509,"About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated £10bn to the economy. Ceremonies this year have been devastated by coronavirus, but Northern Ireland will allow small outdoors weddings from Monday. There is no official word yet about the rest of the UK. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to take place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland has allowed weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have been granted emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment"", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act"", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to £30,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."
54,Coronavirus: Why are international comparisons difficult?,Should you be comparing Covid-19 statistics between countries?,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52311014,"Everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling the coronavirus pandemic, compared with others. But there are all sorts of challenges in comparing countries, such as how widely they test for Covid-19 and whether they count deaths from the virus in the same way. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University has said trying to rank different countries to decide which is the worst in Europe is a ""completely fatuous exercise"". But he's also referred to ""the bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy"" and said ""clearly it's important to note that group is way above, in terms of their mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, who have low fatality rates."" So, when it comes to comparing countries, what factors do you need to take into account? First of all, there are differences in how countries record Covid-19 deaths. France and Germany, for example, have been including deaths in care homes in the headline numbers they produce every day. But the daily figures for England referred only to deaths in hospitals until 29 April, when they started factoring in deaths in care homes as well. A further complication is that there is no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. Does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics, or are the suspicions of a doctor enough? Germany counts deaths in care homes only if people have tested positive for the virus. Belgium, on the other hand, includes any death in which a doctor suspects coronavirus was involved. The UK's daily figures only count deaths when somebody has tested positive for the virus, but its weekly figures include suspected cases. Also, does the virus need to be the main cause of death, or does any mention on a death certificate count? Again, different countries do things differently. So, are you really comparing like with like? There is a lot of focus on death rates, but there are different ways of measuring them too. One is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of all the people who test positive for coronavirus, how many go on to die? But different countries are testing in different ways. Early in the outbreak, the UK mainly tested people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital. That can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country with a wider testing programme. The more testing a country carries out, the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms, or perhaps no symptoms at all. In other words, the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate. Another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a country's population - the numbers of deaths per million people, for example. But that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached. If a country's first case was early in the global outbreak, then it has had longer for its death toll to grow. One way to take account of that is to look at how a country has done since reaching a particular point in the pandemic - the day it recorded its 50th death for example. But even that poses some problems. A country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and to reduce the eventual death toll. It is also worth emphasising, when studying these comparisons, that most people who get infected with coronavirus will recover. There are other factors to take into account beyond the numbers themselves. It is more difficult to have confidence in data that comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems. Is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like China or Iran accurate? We don't really know. Calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population, China's figures are extraordinarily low, even after it revised upwards the death toll in Wuhan by 50%. So, can we really trust the data? There are real differences in the populations in different countries. Demographics are particularly important - that's things like average age, or where people live. Comparisons have been made between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but they are problematic. Ireland has a much lower population density, and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas. It makes more sense to compare Dublin City and County with an urban area in the UK of about the same size (like Merseyside) than to try to compare the two countries as a whole. Similarly, a better though still imperfect comparison for London, Europe's major global city, may be with New York, the biggest global hub in the United States. You also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure. A comparison of death rates between countries in Europe and Africa wouldn't necessarily work, because countries in Africa tend to have much younger populations. We know that older people are much more likely to die of Covid-19. On the other hand, most European countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most African countries. And that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus, as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing. Health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic, but they are not all the same. ""Do people actively seek treatment, how easy is it to get to hospitals, do you have to pay to be treated well? All of these things vary from place to place,"" says Prof Andy Tatem, of the University of Southampton. Another big factor is the level of comorbidity - this means the number of other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure - which people may already have when they get infected. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far. Both Germany and South Korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries. The number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates. But not all testing data is the same - some countries record the number of people tested, while others record the total number of tests carried out (many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result). The timing of testing, and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community, also need to be taken into account. Germany and South Korea tested aggressively very early on, and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading. But Italy, which has also done a lot of tests, has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths.  Italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold. The UK has done the same thing. So, is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons? ""What you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another, and what you can learn from that,"" says Prof Jason Oke from the University of Oxford. ""And testing seems to be the most obvious example so far."" But until this outbreak is over it won't be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better. ""That's when we can really learn the lessons for next time,"" says Prof Oke. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"
55,Can superspreading be stopped?,"Identifying superspreading events could be crucial in the fight against the virus, scientists say.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:16:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52903787,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people. This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid."" Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies. How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including: But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events. ""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says. ""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission."" Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases."" But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms. All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time. But Dr Knight says there is another common thread. ""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky. ""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example."" Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection. ""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors. ""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible. ""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk."" Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says. Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus. But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed, Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge."" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

57,Coronavirus: How dangerous is lifting lockdown?,"Why is lifting restrictions being described as a ""dangerous moment""?","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 23:57:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52878816,"Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a ""dangerous moment"" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. ""It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,"" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at ""Level 4"" rather than ""Level 3"" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is ""not a lot of room"" for manoeuvre and the data ""urges caution"". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those ""following the science"". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. ""Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,"" argued Prof Calum Semple. There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a ""second wave"". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. ""With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,"" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: ""I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. ""It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.""

58,Coronavirus: Why we don't know how many are being tested,The UK Statistics Authority has criticised the government's handling of Covid-19 testing data.,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 16:47:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52891611,"The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are ""far from complete and comprehensible"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had ""temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting"". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. ""People tested"" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with ""void"" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one ""person tested"" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a ""small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test"", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was ""just not happening"". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as ""smoke and mirrors"". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to ""show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the ""people tested"" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the ""people tested"" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as ""people tested"" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed ""to avoid confusion"". Follow Rachel on Twitter"
59,Social distancing: A practical guide to how to socialise now,Meeting friends? Here's how to handle the awkward new rules - from sharing food to avoiding hugs.,"Sat, 30 May 2020 08:43:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52848793,"The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone ""we're all going to wash our hands once an hour"". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says ""wash your hands"". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."
60,Atatiana Jefferson: 'Why I will no longer call the police',"When James Smith called police to check his neighbour was OK, she ended up dead. Never again, he says.","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:29:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53052917,"James Smith has never wanted much to do with the police but he called them to check on his neighbour in the Texas city of Fort Worth, because it was late at night and her front door was wide open. Soon afterwards he heard a gunshot, and later saw the dead body of a 28-year-old woman, his neighbour's daughter, carried out on a stretcher. James Smith is angry, hurt and tired. Every death of a black person at the hands of a police officer takes him back to the moment in October when Atatiana Jefferson was killed. ""I have to live with this guilt, with this cloud hanging over me for the rest of my years,"" he says. Because he was the reason that the police were there that night. At around 02:30 on 12 October he was woken by his niece and nephew, who told him the front door of their neighbour's house was wide open and the lights were on. The owner of the house, Yolanda Carr, had a heart condition and had recently been in and out of intensive care, so Smith was worried something had happened to her. He went across the road and noticed the lawnmower and other gardening equipment were still plugged in, which he thought was strange. So he dialled a number in the phone book to request a ""wellness check"" - expecting that a police officer would come out, knock on the door and check the family was OK. He didn't know that Carr was in hospital that night and that her daughter and grandson were up late playing video games. He was standing directly opposite the house when the police arrived. One of the officers, Aaron Dean, had his gun drawn as he approached the front door and then walked around the side of the house to the back garden. Seconds later there was a gunshot. ""When that bullet went off I heard her spirit say, 'Don't let them get away with it,'"" Smith says. ""And that's pretty much why I stayed out there all night long until they brought her out."" Police soon filled the street, but they wouldn't tell him what had happened. It wasn't until they wheeled a body out six hours later that he knew Yolanda Carr's daughter, Atatiana Jefferson, had been killed. The two families were still getting to know each other. Yolanda Carr had bought the house four years earlier and was fiercely proud of it. Her house is separated from James Smith's by a road and their wide, green, manicured lawns. Smith is a veteran of the neighbourhood. He's raised children and grandchildren there, and five members of his family still live on the same street. Keeping the yard straight is like a ritual in the area, he says, one that Atatiana's family had been quick to adopt. He describes Yolanda Carr as a hard-working lady. ""She had some problems in life that she overcame and her home was her trophy."" Atatiana had been staying in the house while her mother was unwell. She was saving for medical school while caring for her mother and her eight-year-old nephew. A few days before the killing there had been a car crash on the street, James Smith remembers. Atatiana rushed out to help, and she stayed with the people in the car until the ambulance came. That was just her nature, he says. ""She intended to become a doctor,"" he says, before going silent for a moment. ""But that's not going to happen now."" Sometimes he would mow their lawn for them, Atatiana would bring him water and they'd chat. The day that she died she had been mowing the lawn herself, showing her nephew how to do it. On the footage from the officer's body cam, released after she was killed, officer Aaron Dean can be seen walking up to a window at the back of the house, where Atatiana briefly appears. ""Put your hands up, show me your hands!"" he shouts. He has barely finished speaking when he fires through the window. He never declared he was a police officer. Aaron Dean resigned before he could be fired. He was quickly arrested and in December he was indicted for murder, but the trial has been delayed by the coronavirus pandemic. Fort Worth police chief Ed Kraus said he ""could not make sense"" of why Atatiana Jefferson had to lose her life. In a press conference he seemed emotional as he spoke about the damage that her death had done to relations between the police and the community. But James Smith doesn't find any of this reassuring. Atatiana's death has destroyed what little faith he had in law enforcement. ""We don't have a relationship with the police because we don't trust the police,"" he says. ""So if we can stay out of their way, we're fine."" He's more reluctant than ever to call them. Recently, when his sister heard gunshots in the neighbourhood she asked him to call 911, but he refused. ""It's an experience that unfortunately, you would have to be a person of colour to understand,"" he says. ""I don't buy the police kneeling and hugging people, because we've been kneeling and hugging and praying for 60 years."" He doesn't feel that the case against Aaron Dean is being pursued properly. It troubles him that no-one from law enforcement has come to speak to him since the night of the shooting. It's his belief that if he hadn't spoken to the media the following morning, Atatiana's death might not have been investigated. He's also upset with the pace of the trial. ""With the pandemic going on they said it could be 2021 before this thing starts. On the other hand, had it been a person or colour we'd be tried, convicted and have started our sentence already,"" he says. ""We're still holding our breath. Pardon the phrase, but we can't breathe."" There are about 1,000 ""officer-involved shootings"" in which someone is killed every year in the US. These statistics are not centrally collected but various organisations and researchers have been compiling the data, mostly from media reports. According to one of these organisations, Mapping Police Violence, in 2019 black people represented 24% of those killed by police despite making up only 13% of the population. Dr Philip Stinson of Bowling Green State University has also compiled an extensive database on police crime and, analysing cases where police have been arrested, has found that police crimes against black people tend to involve violence more often than police crimes against other races. Convictions for these crimes are rare. Between 2013 and 2019, Mapping Police Violence recorded more than 7,500 cases in which officers shot and killed someone, but according to Stinson's database only 71 were charged with murder or manslaughter and only 23 were convicted of a crime related to the killing. Since 2005, Stinson calculates, only five non-federal police officers have been convicted of murder. When James Smith went on TV to talk about his neighbour's death he learned that this was the seventh officer-involved shooting of 2019 in Fort Worth, a city of less than one million people. But shootings are only part of the problem. In the midst of the George Floyd protests in early June, a Fort Worth police officer called Tiffany Bunton spoke out about the death of her uncle in police custody two years ago. Christopher Lowe died in the back of a police vehicle after being detained by two officers. The body camera footage of his arrest shows officers dragging him to their car. It's disturbing to watch. Though he's compliant throughout the arrest, the officers taunt Lowe as he struggles to stand up and to walk. He tells them he's sick. ""I can't breathe,"" he says, ""I'm dying."" ""Don't pull that [expletive],"" the officer says. And later, ""If you spit on me bud I'm going to put your face in the [expletive] dirt."" Thirteen minutes later Lowe was found dead of a drug overdose in the back of the car. Tiffany Bunton believes his death could have been prevented if the officers had called an ambulance, instead of ignoring his symptoms and insulting him when he told them he was unwell. Five officers were fired in January 2019, as a result. A year later two of them got their jobs back. When I asked James Smith if he was familiar with this case he simply replied, ""That's what we go through. So we avoid the police as best we can."" Two weeks after Atatiana's funeral, her father, Marquis Jefferson, died from a heart attack. His brother believes it was grief that killed him. Her mother Yolanda Carr was in hospital the night her daughter was killed and was too sick to attend her funeral. In January she was well enough to return home, and James Smith said he'd treat her to lunch. He was waiting for the barbecue place to open when an ambulance screeched down the street and parked outside the house. He rushed over and found paramedics trying to resuscitate her. She was wearing a T-shirt covered in portraits of her daughter, and lying on a cushion that Smith had given her, decorated with a print of Atatiana's face. In early June the mayor of Fort Worth, Betsy Price put out a statement on the death of George Floyd - who was killed in Minneapolis when officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. In the statement the mayor mentioned Floyd by name but referred to Atatiana only as Fort Worth's ""own tragedy"". ""She didn't even mention Atatiana's name,"" Smith says. It felt like a knife being twisted in his gut. As he watches protests all over the country in response to George Floyd's death, he wonders why people didn't respond to the killing of Atatiana in the same way. ""The quieter we are the more likely that Atatiana is forgotten and I don't want her forgotten,"" he says. On 19 June Atatiana's remaining family - her sisters and brothers - are launching a foundation in her honour, funded by donations they received in the wake of her death. The Atatiana Project will focus on education and on improving relations between the police and the community. It will be based in the house where Atatiana was shot. On Facebook, James Smith proudly posts pictures of a wall in his home, filled with framed photos of his children, nieces and nephews in their graduation gowns and mortarboard hats. They're smiling, holding rolled up bachelors and masters' degrees. He and Yolanda Carr should be American success stories. A postal worker and a nurse who worked hard, saved money, educated their children and bought beautiful homes on a quiet street to enjoy into their old age. But James Smith is not sure if he can be happy in this neighbourhood again. ""I look through my dining room window and I see Atatiana's house. When I wash my dishes I look out of my window I see Atatiana's house. When I sit on my back deck I see Atatiana's house."" And every time the image of that night comes back to him. ""I'm going to see these people coming across the street and going to the back of the house and bang! I'm going to see this when my great-grandchildren are born… when I'm sitting on a rocking chair."" Robert Jones was arrested in 1992, accused of killing a young British tourist in New Orleans. Four years later, he went on trial - by this time another man had already been convicted of the crime, but he was prosecuted anyway. The judge who sentenced the young father to life in prison now says his skin colour sealed his fate. Locked up for 23 years - when the real killer had already been jailed (2015)"
61,Officer in Floyd's death under review by police conduct board,"The actions of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin are being reviewed by state police conduct investigators, according to court documents filed Tuesday.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:41:33 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/NV23F4OH8tA/index.html,"Minneapolis The actions of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin are being reviewed by state police conduct investigators, according to court documents filed Tuesday. In a letter to the Hennepin County District Court, an official from the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training requested records associated with the state's prosecution, indicating the standards board is ""obligated to review the facts and circumstances of this matter."" Chauvin was charged by prosecutors with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for his alleged role in the May 25 death of Minneapolis resident George Floyd. In eyewitness video footage of the police encounter involving Floyd, Chauvin was seen pressing his knee to the African American man's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd lost consciousness. Three other officers involved in the incident also face charges. The local medical examiner ruled Floyd's death a homicide, as did experts hired by his family, although they do not agree on what caused it. Disclosure of the state's police conduct and licensing board's involvement makes it the fourth official review of the circumstances surrounding Floyd's death. Besides the state's criminal investigation, the FBI is conducting a federal civil rights investigation into the matter. The Minnesota Department of Human Rights also is reviewing an entire decade of police records from the Minneapolis Police Department to determine whether there is evidence to suggest the department has engaged in a pattern of unfairly targeting of minorities. The state Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training ""is responsible for licensing over 10,500 active peace officers and 109 active part-time peace officers"" in Minnesota, according to the agency. If Chauvin is found to have engaged in misconduct, the agency can suspend his law enforcement license. While not speaking about any specific case, Erik Misselt, the board's interim executive director, told CNN the penalty for violating policing standards includes a range of punitive options, including the suspension or revocation of a police officer's law enforcement license. News of the board's involvement in investigating Chauvin is not the first time the agency has found itself in the public spotlight following Floyd's death. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said last week he wants to expand the board and establish a new police-community relations council. While announcing new proposed policing reform measures, Walz called for the requirement of new ""real-time data collection and analysis of complaint, discipline and use of force data and use it to inform reforms at the POST board,"" particularly as it relates to the licensing of police officers.

62,Man allegedly linked to Boogaloo movement accused of going to a BLM protest with a machine gun to kill cops,"A suspect in the shooting deaths of two officers in California had symbols linked to the extremist Boogaloo movement, a loosely knit group of heavily armed, anti-government extremists, US Attorney David Anderson said.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 03:06:41 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/c2_YlMkgKrU/index.html,"A suspect in the shooting deaths of two officers in California had symbols linked to the extremist Boogaloo movement, a loosely knit group of heavily armed, anti-government extremists, US Attorney David Anderson said. Steven Carrillo, 32, faces a federal murder charge in the May 29 drive-by shooting of David Patrick Underwood, a federal protective services officer, in Oakland, Anderson said. At the same time, a protest against police brutality was taking place nearby. Carrillo, an active-duty staff sergeant stationed at Travis Air Force Base at the time of the shooting, is also the suspect in the June 6 death of a Santa Cruz sheriff's deputy, Sheriff Jim Hart said last week. ""The Boogaloo term is used by extremists to reference a violent uprising, or impending civil war in the United States,"" Anderson said. ""Pat Underwood was murdered because he wore a uniform,"" Anderson said. An attorney for Carrillo said he wants people to resist ""the urge to rush to judgment and wait until the facts come out."" ""There is more to Mr. Carrillo than the picture painted by law enforcement,"" Jeffrey Stotter told CNN. Carrillo ""was a loyal and good airman and has also suffered severe personal loss in the suicide of his wife two years ago,"" said Stotter, who met with Carrillo on Tuesday. ""He's the father of two children who have not only lost their mother, but now they've lost their father."" During a shootout with Santa Cruz sheriff's deputies on June 6, Carrillo used his own blood to write Boogaloo phrases on a vehicle he allegedly carjacked while trying to flee, Anderson said, describing evidence found in the case. Investigators believe Carrillo used a ""ghost gun,"" a homemade AR-15 type rifle, in both the Oakland and Santa Cruz shootings, according to the complaint. The rifle was recovered in the Santa Cruz investigation. A second man, Robert Alvin Justus, Jr., is alleged to have driven the van used in the Oakland shooting, according to Anderson. Justus faces charges of aiding and abetting murder and attempted murder, Anderson said. It's not clear whether Justus has legal representation. Justus admitted to the FBI on June 11 that he had driven the van during the Oakland shooting, according to the complaint. He told investigators ""he did not want to participate in the murder, but that he felt that he had to participate because he was trapped in the van"" with Carrillo, the complaint says. Surveillance video footage ""shows Justus walking on foot through downtown Oakland prior to the homicide,"" FBI Agent Brett Woolard wrote in the complaint, adding Justus ""could have walked away from the van and not returned, or he could have reported"" Carrillo to law enforcement nearby. Carrillo is also charged with the attempted murder of another protective services officer who was injured in the Oakland shooting, and Justus is charged with aiding and abetting attempted murder, the US attorney said. Carrillo was a team leader for the Phoenix Raven, a highly trained security team that guards USAF aircraft in high-terrorist and high-crime areas overseas, according to Department of Defense records. He had served in Kuwait, Texas and Utah. Speaking of the allegations that Carrillo is a member of the Boogaloo movement, Stotter said, ""What this suggests and highlights is a larger conversation that maybe needs to happen about the impact and influence of groups with extremists ideologies that seem to flourish on social media and on the internet as a whole."" ""These groups are not based in Iraq or Syria, they are based in America -- they reach out to radicalize vulnerable individuals, whether they be servicemen or otherwise vulnerable adults."" Stotter declined to comment on the impact these groups may have had on his client. Carrillo could face the death penalty if convicted. CNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report."
63,Police officers across the US are quitting,"Since George Floyd's death three weeks ago, the role of America's criminal justice system has been catapulted to the forefront of national conversation with thousands calling for sweeping changes within the country's policing system.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:47:08 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/k4q-Pi3aSJg/index.html,"Since George Floyd's death three weeks ago, the role of America's criminal justice system has been catapulted to the forefront of national conversation with thousands calling for sweeping changes within the country's policing system. Protesters have called on their community leaders to hold officers accountable and defund police departments -- in hopes those funds could be redirected toward other programs. And many local leaders have responded, signing orders changing how departments operate, promising further reform and acting quickly on incidents of police brutality that have surfaced in recent weeks. But as anger bubbles in parts of the country, some US police departments are facing their own crises and some officers have now opted to walk away. In Minneapolis In Minneapolis, at least seven police officers resigned from the department since protests sparked by Floyd's death in late May flooded the city's streets. More than half a dozen officers are also in the process of leaving, a city spokesperson told CNN. The number of officers who are no longer with the department doesn't include the four men who were involved in Floyd's death and were fired, according to Casper Hill, the city's spokesperson, ""There's nothing that leads us to believe that at this point the numbers are so great that it's going to be problematic,"" police spokesman John Elder told the Minneapolis Star Tribune of the departing officers, which include both patrol officers and detectives. ""People seek to leave employment for a myriad reasons — the MPD is no exception,"" Elder said. Members of the department condemned the actions of ex-Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin -- who pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes -- in an open letter last week. ""Derek Chauvin failed as a human and stripped George Floyd of his dignity and life. This is not who we are,"" said the letter, signed by 14 officers. ""We're not the union or the administration,"" the letter says. In Atlanta Atlanta became the epicenter of protests this week after a black man was shot in the back and killed Friday night. Following Rayshard Brooks' killing, Atlanta's police chief stepped down and the officer who killed the 27-year-old father was fired. A second officer was placed on administrative duty. Atlanta police said in a statement eight officers have resigned from the department this month. ""Our personnel data indicates that we have had anywhere from two to six officers resign per month in 2020,"" Atlanta police said in a statement. The Atlanta Police Foundation earlier reported that 19 officers had resigned ""since the start of social justice protests."" The foundation has since retracted that incorrect number. Prior to Brooks' killing, some were critical of charges that six officers faced after video captured the group violently handling a pair of black college students who were in their car and were stuck in traffic caused by ongoing protests. Those critics included Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields, who had already fired two officers involved, and said she didn't expect charges. Criminal charges ""were never part of any discussion that I had with the Mayor or her administration,"" Shields wrote in the memo provided to CNN by the department. ""I called the DA and strongly expressed my concern, both to the appropriateness and the timing of any charges,"" Shields wrote. In South Florida In South Florida, 10 officers resigned from their city's SWAT unit over concerns about safety, saying they feel ""restrained by the politicization of our tactics,"" according to documents obtained by CNN. The officers sent a letter to Hallandale Beach Police Chief Sonia Quinones, saying they were ""minimally equipped, under trained and often times restrained by the politicization of our tactics to the extent of placing the safety of dogs over the safety of the team members."" They also said they were displeased after the command staff took a knee with activists and others during a demonstration on Monday, according to the letter. ""Until these conditions and sentiments are rectified and addressed, we cannot safely, effectively and in good faith carry out duties in this capacity without putting ourselves and our families at this needless increased level of risk,"" the officers wrote. The officers resigned only from the SWAT unit, not from the police department, Hallandale Beach City Manager Greg Chavarria said. The chief told CNN Monday night she was ""extremely disappointed"" in the officers' decision. ""They walked away from their assignment, they never talked to me in advance and let me know their concerns,"" she said. ""If we're not connecting and we're not communicating, then we're not resolving concerns."" She said what the officers wrote in their memo was inaccurate, adding she didn't kneel to oppose police but to be in solidarity with their community. ""We provided increased training hours, we provided over $100,000 in the last two years in SWAT-specific equipment and then they inaccurately and falsely stated I took a knee in solidarity with the vice mayor, which was not the case. It was in reverence with our community,"" the chief said. In Buffalo In Buffalo, New York, nearly 60 officers resigned from the force's emergency response team over the suspension of two police officers who were caught in a video pushing an elderly protester to the ground. ""Fifty-seven resigned in disgust because of the treatment of two of their members, who were simply executing orders,"" Buffalo Police Benevolent Association president John Evans had previously told CNN affiliate WGRZ. The two officers captured on video were charged with assault and pleaded not guilty. The 75-year-old protester was seen falling to the ground and bleeding from his head. The 57 officers that turned in their resignation did not quit from the force -- but made up the entire active emergency response team of the department, the Buffalo mayor's office told CNN. A few members of the unit are out currently and are not included in the 57 that resigned, according to the mayor's office. CNN's Josh Campbell, Aaron Cooper and Chandler Thornton contributed to this report."

• Tapper reacts to concentration camp claim: If true, this is obscene
• Bolton accuses Trump of lying ahead of book publication
• Stelter explains why Trump is 'clearly rattled' by Bolton's new book","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:57:18 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nTg3hP2zr-I/index.html,"Washington Former national security adviser John Bolton has leveled a stunning accusation against his former boss, claiming in his new book that President Donald Trump personally asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to help him win the 2020 US presidential election, according to an excerpt published by the Wall Street Journal Wednesday. One notable interaction described by Bolton was a meeting between the two leaders at the G-20 Summit in Osaka last June, where the US President ""stunningly"" turned the conversation to the upcoming 2020 election. The former national security adviser said Trump ""stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome,"" adding that he ""would print Trump's exact words, but the government's prepublication review process has decided otherwise."" Bolton said the conversation turned back to the trade deal, and Trump ""proposed that for the remaining $350 billion of trade imbalances (by Trump's arithmetic), the US would not impose tariffs, but he again returned to importuning Xi to buy as many American farm products as China could."" The allegation that Trump asked the leader of a major US adversary to help him win the next election will reverberate across Washington six months after Trump was impeached on charges he sought help from Ukraine with his reelection bid. Trump openly asked China to investigate his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden last year, and has refused to accept the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 election to try to help him win. The claims come as the Trump campaign has tried to make China a central issue of the 2020 election, framing the President as tougher on Beijing than Biden. The revelation was just one of several that emerged Wednesday from Bolton's book, titled ""In the Room Where it Happened,"" which has been subject to a months-long legal battle between the White House and the former national security adviser. The fight escalated Tuesday after the Trump administration went to court to try to claw back Bolton's earnings for the book and to potentially stop its publication, arguing in a lawsuit that Bolton had breached non-disclosure agreements and was risking national security by exposing classified information. But the White House's legal action has done little to stop details from Bolton's book from becoming public as The New York Times and other media outlets revealed Wednesday that they obtained advanced copies. It's scheduled for official release next week. According to the excerpt published in the Journal, after Xi proved amenable to reopening trade discussions, Bolton claimed Trump extolled the Chinese leader as the greatest in that country's history. Broadly speaking, Bolton characterized Trump's interactions with Xi as ""adlibbed,"" bolstered by personal flattery and driven by political ambition rather than policy. ""Trump's conversations with Xi reflected not only the incoherence in his trade policy but also the confluence in Trump's mind of his own political interests and US national interests,"" Bolton wrote in the excerpt. ""Trump commingled the personal and the national not just on trade questions but across the whole field of national security. I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn't driven by reelection calculations."" Bolton described a litany of China-related matters where Trump subverted the US position based on conversations or gestures for Xi -- tariffs, telecommunications, Hong Kong protests, even China's mass detention of Uyghur Muslims. ""At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in June 2019, with only interpreters present, Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do,"" Bolton writes. ""The National Security Council's top Asia staffer, Matthew Pottinger, told me that Trump said something very similar during his November 2017 trip to China."" The US State Department estimates that more than one million Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups have been detained by the Chinese government in internment camps, where they are reportedly ""subjected to torture, cruel and inhumane treatment such as physical and sexual abuse, forced labor, and death."" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Beijing's treatment of the Uyghurs ""the stain of the century."" On the massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong last year, Bolton claimed that Trump said he didn't ""want to get involved,"" and, ""we have human-rights problems too."" In recent weeks, Trump has announced actions against China for its moves against Hong Kong's autonomy. New York Times: Bolton says impeachment probe should have investigated Trump's actions beyond Ukraine Trump's interactions with Xi are not the only examples of actions by the President that Bolton claims were troubling and should have been investigated as part of the House impeachment inquiry, which only focused on matters related to Ukraine, according to the excerpt and the New York Times, which obtained a copy of the book in advance of its scheduled publication. Specifically, Bolton highlights Trump's willingness to intervene in criminal investigations ""to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked,"" noting cases involving law firms in China and Turkey, the Times said. ""The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn't accept,"" Bolton writes, according to the Times. Bolton's accusation that the House's impeachment inquiry didn't go far enough come after he refused to testify before House impeachment investigators last year, threatening a legal battle if he was subpoenaed. Bolton offered to testify during the Senate impeachment trial, but Republicans voted to reject hearing from any witnesses. Bolton's op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday, titled ""The Scandal of Trump's China Policy,"" paints his former boss as a US President who is overly susceptible to flattery and an administration that ""struggled to avoid being sucked into the black hole of U.S.-China trade issues."" The book excerpt was published after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday, alleging that Bolton's 500-plus page manuscript was ""rife with classified information."" Prosecutors said that Bolton backed out of an ongoing White House vetting process for the book that he'd been obligated to do as a result of the agreements. ""(Bolton) struck a bargain with the United States as a condition of his employment in one of the most sensitive and important national security positions in the United States Government and now wants to renege on that bargain by unilaterally deciding that the prepublication review process is complete and deciding for himself whether classified information should be made public,"" prosecutors write. The legal approach in the case is one of the more extreme attempts in recent years to stop a former Trump adviser from recounting his experience, and the administration's longshot attempt to stop the book's publication raises major First Amendment implications.

65,US stuck with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine,"• Live updates: Los Angeles County reaches another single day high in Covid-19 cases
• 10 states see highest average of daily virus cases","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:48:42 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/seSajbuZg28/index.html,"The federal government is stuck with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine now that the US Food and Drug Administration has revoked permission for the drug to be distributed to treat coronavirus patients.  The government started stockpiling donated hydroxychloroquine in late March, after President Trump touted it as ""very encouraging"" and ""very powerful"" and a ""game-changer.""  But Monday, the FDA revoked its emergency use authorization to use the drug to treat Covid-19, saying there was ""no reason to believe"" the drug was effective against the virus, and that it increased the risk of side effects, including heart problems.  That leaves the Strategic National Stockpile with 63 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, plus another 2 million doses of chloroquine, a related drug donated by Bayer, according to Carol Danko, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services.   Many public health experts point to all of this as an unfortunate chapter in the history of the pandemic thus far.  ""Nationally, we put a great emphasis on one drug, hydroxychloroquine,"" said David Holtgrave, the dean of the School of Public Health at the University at Albany, who co-authored a study of the drug as a treatment for coronavirus. ""I worry that history will judge this as having over-invested in one treatment pathway as opposed to looking more broadly at a larger number of treatment candidates.""  Before the FDA revoked its authorization, the stockpile had already distributed 31 million doses. Novartis and Mylan donated doses of the drug to the stockpile.  ""HHS is working with the companies that donated the product to determine the available options for the product that remains in the Strategic National Stockpile,"" Danko wrote in a statement to CNN.  Hydroxychloroquine has been used for many years to treat diseases such as malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus. After President Trump started touting hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19, patients with those illnesses reported having trouble finding the drug.  The news about the leftover doses was first reported in The New York Times.  Last month, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn wrote that his agency's decision to authorize hydroxychloroquine in March ""was based on evaluation of the EUA criteria and the scientific evidence available at that time.""  However, many infectious disease experts, including those who've studied the drug for coronavirus, say there was never any evidence that the drug worked for the virus.  In March, Trump tweeted that a French study showed hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin ""have a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine."" He continued to be a cheerleader for the drug for several months, and even said he took it himself after being exposed to staffers with the virus. That French study had so many problems that the society that published it has backed away from it. First, the study didn't conclude that the drug worked for Covid patients -- just that it decreased the amount of the virus found in the nose and throat.  Also, it was a very small study -- just 20 patients -- and it ignored patients who took hydroxychloroquine and died or ended up in the intensive care unit.  After complaints about the study, the International Study of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, which published the study in its medical journal, concluded that the study ""does not meet the Society's expected standard."" Since then, two major studies have found that the drug is ineffective against coronavirus. One of the studies, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, also showed that Covid patients who took the drug were more than twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest. "

The incident, which happened early Wednesday, occurred as protesters marched in downtown Portland as part of the weeks-long protests calling for police reform. It mirrors an incident last week in Henrico County, Virginia, where a man was arrested after he allegedly drove his car through a Black Lives Matter march. Anthony Eaglehorse-Lassandro, 27, came upon a crowd of protesters just after 1 a.m. ET near Southwest 3rd Avenue near Alder Street in his car, police say in a statement. Eaglehorse-Lassandro then drove into the crowd, striking several demonstrators, driving off at ""a high rate of speed,"" and going the wrong way on streets, the statement adds. Eaglehorse-Lassandro injured three people but all three had injuries that, police say, ""are believed to be non-life threatening."" Two were taken to the hospital by ambulance and one patient was taken for treatment in a personal car, police added. After Eaglehorse-Lassandro fled the scene in his car, police in aircraft ""were able to watch the vehicle and provide location updates as the suspect vehicle drove recklessly,"" the statement said. Eventually, he was arrested after he hit another car, a barrier, and tried to flee on foot, police say. Eaglehorse-Lassandro was arrested on counts that include ""Felony Hit and Run,"" ""Reckless Driving"", and ""Possession of a Controlled Substance,"" jail records show. It is unclear if he has a lawyer. This was the only arrest related to the evening's protests, police say. "

Trump's campaign is moving forward with plans for Saturday night's event in Tulsa despite complaints from local officials and dire warnings from public health experts about the dangers of packing 20,000 people into cramped indoor quarters amid the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, Biden, his presumptive Democratic opponent, has made a much more methodical return to the trail -- wearing masks while near others and practicing social distancing as he follows the guidance of public health officials and a team of doctors and experts his campaign has assembled, while forgoing in-person events that are open to the public. View Trump and Biden head-to-head polling Their approaches are offering a real-time window into their vastly different views of science, which Trump has repeatedly questioned and Biden has embraced, and the role of the presidency, with Biden seeking to model the behavior recommended by public health officials and Trump focused on sending the message that the United States is emerging from the pandemic -- even as 21 states see an increase in coronavirus cases. Trump ""refuses to wear a mask, failing one of the most basic tests of leadership,"" Biden said in a speech at a recreational center outside Philadelphia on Wednesday, attended by a limited crowd of about 20 invited guests and reporters. ""He takes no responsibility. He exercises no leadership. Now we're just flat surrendering the fight. Instead of leading the charge to beat the virus, he's just basically waved the white flag ... so he can get back to his campaign rallies that will put people at risk,"" Biden said. ""Donald Trump thinks if he puts his head in the sand, the American people will, too,"" he said. ""It doesn't work that way."" For Biden, the contrast appears to be paying off: A CNN poll released last week found him with a 14-percentage-point advantage over Trump nationally among registered voters, and several other recent polls have shown him with similar leads. 'That is the gold standard and his stock and trade' Trump's Tulsa rally has come together in a haphazard manner. It was initially planned for Juneteenth, the holiday that commemorates slaves' emancipation in the United States, but amid an outcry and protests over racial injustice across the nation, Trump's campaign postponed it by one day. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have also announced plans to visit other states in the coming weeks, which would make the Tulsa event the first in a series of rallies with less than five months remaining before the 2020 general election. The campaign moves come as Pence, in a call with governors and in a misleading Wall Street Journal opinion piece, this week portrayed a nation ""winning the fight against the invisible enemy"" and said that concerns of a second wave of coronavirus are ""overblown."" For its part, Trump's campaign has bragged that more than 1 million people have signed up for tickets to the Saturday night rally in Tulsa's BOK Center, and the campaign is exploring overflow venues to add. The rally -- which goes against the guidance of Trump's own administration -- has provoked a public outcry, including from local officials. David Bart, the Tulsa City-County Health Department director, pleaded with Trump to postpone the event. And Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum said in a Facebook post Tuesday that he has concerns about the rally. ""I don't like to be the first to try anything. I would have loved some other city to have proven the safety of such an event already,"" he said. Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, has warned that large-scale events are risky at this stage in the pandemic and urged those who attend to wear masks. Trump's campaign has said it will perform temperature checks and have hand sanitizer and masks on hand -- though wearing them would be optional, and Trump himself has not worn masks at public events. ""We always tell people, here's the guidance, feel comfortable, don't feel comfortable. We also know that people don't want to be locked down forever,"" Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway told reporters Wednesday. She cast criticism of Trump's return to holding rallies as motivated not by public health concerns, but by ""those who will never want to do that again because obviously that is the gold standard and his stock and trade for him."" 'He can't ignore it away in June' Biden's style was on display Wednesday outside Philadelphia, where he held a roundtable with four local business owners. They sat spaced apart on a patio outside a restaurant, and didn't shake hands or pose close together for pictures. At the event, he faulted Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. ""One of the problems is that, in my view is, nobody's taking responsibility here. The President says, 'It's not my responsibility. It's not my fault,'"" Biden said. In his speech later, he said Trump had ""lost interest"" in the pandemic and was declaring victory too early. ""Just like he couldn't wish COVID-19 away in March, just like he couldn't tweet it away in April, he can't ignore it away in June,"" Biden said. Biden -- who spent more than two months at home in Delaware after effectively sealing the Democratic presidential nomination with big wins in South Carolina, on Super Tuesday and in the March 10 Michigan primary -- has this month begun a cautious return to campaigning, starting with a Memorial Day wreath-laying ceremony. He has sought to play a healer-in-chief role amid the triple crises of the pandemic, its dire economic costs and the protests across the nation against police brutality and racial injustice following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck. Biden's first flight in nearly three months came last week, with a trip to meet with Floyd's family in a Houston restaurant. Photos from the meeting showed attendees wearing masks. He is increasingly holding roundtable-style events, including one Wednesday in Philadelphia. Before those events, Biden's campaign has screened attendees to make sure none have come in contact with people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. The campaign asks attendees to wear masks and practice social distancing, and has sometimes taken their temperatures upon arrival. Those events -- like the targeted roundtables Biden's campaign has live-streamed on a near-daily basis for months -- are invitation-only. He has not yet held events that are open to the public. Biden has sat for in-person and virtual interviews, and his events and fundraisers are open to the press, usually with a small group of ""pool"" reporters covering them and then distributing detailed notes to other journalists. But his approach has not allowed for the sort of daily give-and-take with reporters that takes place in and around the White House. His campaign has appointed a public health advisory committee, saying it will follow the advice of those doctors and experts on how to operate. Biden aides would not say whether larger public events are in the works. Meanwhile, virtual events have worked well for Biden. His campaign raised $6 million in one night through a joint virtual fundraiser with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and $3.5 million in a similar event with California Sen. Kamala Harris. A virtual fundraiser is planned for later this month with former President Barack Obama. And his polling lead has increased in recent weeks. Trump's campaign blasted Biden on Tuesday for the slow return to in-person campaigning, claiming his approach is about avoiding questions, rather than following public health guidance. ""This is obviously a tactic to help him avoid errors and embarrassing, lost trains of thought, while also conveniently preventing the press corps from asking him any questions in person,"" Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. ""At what point will Biden subject himself to the scrutiny American voters deserve when considering the next President of the United States?"" Murtaugh said. On Wednesday, Murtaugh pointed out on Twitter that it has been 76 days since Biden held a news conference. Trump has also mocked Biden for wearing a mask in public -- something the President has refused to do. Biden, meanwhile, delivered a scathing speech lambasting Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It was carried live across cable news networks. He pointed out that, with its Tulsa rally, Trump's campaign is poised to violate Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, and is asking attendees to sign waivers releasing the campaign from responsibility if they become ill. ""Donald Trump's failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he used to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives and it's putting hope for an economic recovery at risk,"" Biden said.

68,The 84 victims of 2018 Camp Fire given voice at emotional PG&E hearing,Their names and their stories filled the vast courtroom Wednesday less than two years after they perished in the Northern California Camp Fire.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 21:57:29 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/_OsOcmRo_cQ/index.html,"Their names and their stories filled the vast courtroom Wednesday less than two years after they perished in the Northern California Camp Fire. ""These people up here, they're not just statistics, they had names,"" a tearful Thomas LeBlanc said as he remembered his stepdaughter, Kimberly Wehr, in a victim impact statement. The emotional statements gave voice to victims one day after California utility Pacific Gas and Electric Company pleaded guilty Tuesday to 84 counts of involuntary manslaughter and one count of unlawfully starting the Camp Fire, the deadliest blaze in the state's history. ""Being unable to rescue your child is an incalculable parental nightmare,"" LeBlanc said in the Butte County courtroom. ""I leave this courtroom, your honor, as a victim because I have been scarred for life. If they feel just a little bit of pain today, mission accomplished."" The company will be fined ""no more than $3,486,950,"" according to court documents filed in March. It must also reimburse the Butte County District Attorney's Office $500,000 for the costs of its investigation into the blaze. Among other provisions, PG&E must establish a trust, compensating victims of the 2018 Camp Fire and other wildfires to the tune of $13.5 billion, according to the plea agreement included in a regulatory filing. It has to pay hundreds of millions to the town of Paradise and Butte County and cooperate with prosecutors' investigation, the plea deal says. Survivors spoke Wednesday as part of presentence proceedings. Last words as the fire closed in Joseph Downer, remembered his brother Andrew Downer, whom he had spoken with on the phone 15 minutes before flames consumed his home. There is no price on the lives lost, he said. ""Imagine what would happen if an ordinary citizen killed 80 people ... I don't believe justice is served by a $3 million dollar fine. That is less than what Mr. Johnson makes in a year,"" said Joseph Downer, referring to utility CEO and President Bill Johnson, who will retire at the end of June. ""Mr. Johnson flew here on a private jet and yet PG&E cannot pay $13 for a new C-hook,"" Downer said, referring to the metal device in a utility tower that failed and caused an insulator assembly to fall and start the fire in dry vegetation. ""My brother Andrew Downer paid the ultimate price because PG&E just didn't give a damn. "" Richard Salazar, one of the four adopted children of Phyllis and Frederick Salazar, who perished in the fire, said he misses them very much. ""They were everything to me,"" he said. Laurie Teague spoke of her stepfather, Herbert Alderman, 79, who was married to her late mother for 28 years. ""He didn't get around very well and he didn't drive but he was still as sharp as a tack,"" she recalled. ""And he knew everything that was going on around him."" Alderman had been receiving physical therapy at home. On the morning of his death, he called the receptionist at his health care provider at least five times, ""each time sounding more panicky and desperate,"" Teague said. ""He was pleading for help. Begging for someone to come and get him,"" said the stepdaughter, adding that he was assured help was on the way. ""His last words ... were, 'The fire is two houses away. Help me.' And the phone line went dead,"" Teague remembered. His health care provider had sent help but they couldn't get passed a roadblock. Alderman's remains were found in the rubble of his home. ""My prevailing thought has been, how absolutely terrified Herb must have been,"" Teague said. ""My heart aches for him."" The fire 'killed a town' Butte County District Attorney Michael L. Ramsey said the ""historic moment"" should be a signal that corporations will be held responsible for ""recklessly endangering"" lives. The 84 people ""did not need to die,"" Ramsey said. The deaths were ""of the most unimaginable horror, being burned to death."" No individuals will be sent to prison, Ramsey said. ""This is the first time that PG&E or any major utility has been charged with homicide as the result of a reckless fire. It killed a town,"" Ramsey said, referring to Paradise, which was annihilated by the blaze. Under the plea deal, PG&E waived its right to appeal the case. ""I have heard the pain and the anguish of victims as they've described the loss they continue to endure, and the wounds that can't be healed,"" Johnson said after the plea. ""No words from me could ever reduce the magnitude of such devastation or do anything to repair the damage. But I hope that the actions we are taking here today will help bring some measure of peace."" Johnson was in court Tuesday, where Butte County Superior Court Judge Michael Deems read the names of each victim as their photos were shown on a screen, CNN affiliate KTLA reported. Johnson said the utility would never put profits ahead of safety again. He told the judge that PG&E took responsibility for the devastation ""with eyes wide open to what happened and to what must never happen again,"" KTLA reported. In March, the utility and the state agreed to bankruptcy terms, which included an overhaul of PG&E's board selection process, financial structure and oversight. According to investigators with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, PG&E was responsible for the devastating Camp Fire. Electrical lines owned and operated by PG&E started the fire November 8, 2018, CAL Fire said in a news release. ""The tinder dry vegetation and Red Flag conditions consisting of strong winds, low humidity and warm temperatures promoted this fire and caused extreme rates of spread,"" CAL Fire said. PG&E had previously said it was ""probable"" that its equipment started the Camp Fire but that it wasn't conclusive whether its lines ignited a second fire, as CAL Fire alleged. The power company filed for bankruptcy in January 2019 as it came under pressure from billions of dollars in claims tied to deadly wildfires. CNN's Stella Chan, Jay Croft and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report."

Now, Crime Stoppers of Summit County, Ohio, is offering a $50,000 reward for information on the case. Na'kia Crawford, 18, was killed Sunday. And while calls have poured into police, no arrests have been made yet. ""We have devoted hundreds of man hours to this crime already, and we will continue to do so,"" said Akron Police Deputy Chief Jesse Leeser during a news conference Tuesday. Witnesses told police that a black sports car with tinted windows stopped directly behind Crawford's white Chevrolet Malibu. The suspect, or suspects, pulled up to the driver's side of the Malibu and ""fired multiple rounds to the side of her car."" Crawford was taken to a hospital with multiple gunshot wounds, where she later died. Her grandmother was not hurt in the shooting, Leeser said. ""Somebody knows something,"" said Leeser, pleading for the public's help in finding those responsible. Crawford was a recent graduate of Akron's North High School and was planning on attending Central State University. ""The future she dreamed of was stolen from her,"" said Akron Mayor Dan Horrigan. Crawford's family is donating $20,000 to the Crime Stoppers initial $5,000 reward. Another $25,000 was donated by Dr. Cliff Deveny, president and CEO of Summa Health. The Crime Stoppers reward currently totals $50,000, Akron police said. "
70,Analysis: Is Iowa a swing state again?,"Two decades ago, there was no state swingier than Iowa.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 22:31:58 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/cp2SXDXK-3g/index.html,"Two decades ago, there was no state swingier than Iowa. In 2000, Al Gore edged George W. Bush there by just .3% -- roughly 4,000 votes out of more than 1.2 million cast. Four years later, Bush eked out a win over John Kerry in Iowa by just .6%. Barack Obama's ties to the state, which launched his presidential campaign with a win in the Iowa caucuses in 2008, moved the state in his direction -- as he carried it in both of his races. But even as Obama was winning at the top of the ticket, Republicans were making gains down-ballot. Republican Terry Branstad won the governor's race in 2010 and held the office until he left to join the Trump administration in 2017. His lieutenant governor, Kim Reynolds, took over and won a full term in 2018 -- not a great year nationally for Republicans. And President Donald Trump won the state by nearly double digits in 2016. All of that recent history led many political observers to leave Iowa off the list of most competitive states in the coming 2020 election. That decision may have been a mistake, at least according to a new Iowa poll. That poll, conducted by J. Ann Selzer for the Des Moines Register, showed Trump at 44% to former Vice President Joe Biden's 43% -- a statistical dead heat. The poll also showed a majority of Iowans (52%) disapproving of the job Trump has been doing. On the Senate level, newly minted Democratic nominee Theresa Greenfield took 46% to 43% for Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, who, until this poll, wasn't seen as one of the most endangered Republican members. And you don't need to depend only on that poll to see how Iowa has become, again, a swing state. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have lavished attention on Iowa as the 2020 campaign gears up; Pence was in the state on Tuesday and Trump was there in February before the coronavirus lockdown stopped almost all campaign travel. Why is Iowa back to being closely contested at the presidential level? Trump's trade policy -- and the negative effects it's had on Iowa's famers -- absolutely plays a role. Although Iowa farmers said they were (mostly) sticking with Trump in late 2019, the economic slowdown worldwide as a result of the coronavirus may have caused some to reconsider. The Point: Iowa as a battleground state is bad news for Trump, who is already facing a narrowing of his paths to win a second term. "
71,Nooses found hanging in Oakland trees to be investigated as hate crimes,"A hate crime investigation is underway after several nooses were found hanging from trees in Oakland, California.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 22:28:25 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/7un5l8PjPOs/index.html,"A hate crime investigation is underway after several nooses were found hanging from trees in Oakland, California. The nooses were found around the area of Lake Merritt and have been removed, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf said in a tweet on Wednesday. ""Symbols of racial violence have no place in Oakland and will not be tolerated,"" Schaaf said in a statement posted on Twitter. She added that the incident will be investigated as hate crimes. This incident follows the hanging deaths of two black men in Southern California that are being investigated by both local and federal agencies. Robert L. Fuller, 24, was found hanging from a tree early last Wednesday in Palmdale. His death was described by authorities as ""an alleged death by suicide."" But Fuller's family announced that they are seeking an independent investigation and autopsy to determine the cause of his death. In San Bernardino County, about 50 miles away, Malcolm Harsch, 38, was found hung to death at a homeless encampment on May 31. Investigators did not find any evidence of foul play, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. An autopsy was conducted on June 12 and there are still no signs of foul play, the sheriff's department said. The forensic pathologist is waiting for toxicology results before assigning the cause and manner of death. Oakland resident Porchia Freeman took video of what appears to be a noose swinging from tree on near the lake on Tuesday. She said she was walking around the lake when she saw a string swinging in her peripheral vision. Freeman said she stopped in go have a better look and recorded the video. ""I posted it because it was very disturbing to me and I thought I'd bring awareness to the situation,"" Freeman said on a Facebook Live on Wednesday. Freeman added that a man contacted her saying that the rope was left over from a swing he had hung on the tree. Schaaf also addressed these reports on Wednesday. ""Reports that these were part of exercise equipment do not remove nor excuse their torturous and terrorizing effects,"" Schaaf said in a statement. ""We are all responsible for knowing the history and present day reality of lynchings, hate crimes and racial violence. Objects that invoke such terror will not be tolerated in Oakland's public spaces."" CNN's Stella Chan, Amir Vera and David Williams contributed to this report."
72,"Joe Scarborough, shouting on air, blasts Mark Zuckerberg for 'promoting extremism'",Joe Scarborough has had enough of Mark Zuckerberg.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:16:50 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/eZ7mj3NvoVM/index.html,"New York Joe Scarborough has had enough of Mark Zuckerberg. In a nearly seven-minute monologue on his show Wednesday, at times shouting, the MSNBC ""Morning Joe"" host said that the Facebook CEO is a danger to democracy. Social media, including Facebook (FB), has long been a home for conspiracy theories and hate groups. Recently, particularly incendiary speech promoted by President Donald Trump and others has sparked a nationwide outcry about the role of social media in our society. But the killing of federal officer David Patrick Underwood last month, who was shot by a member of the anti-government extremist ""Boogaloo"" group, sent Scarborough over the edge. ""You look at this site where there's a right-wing extremist group that is literally targeting men and women who are dedicating their lives to protecting American citizens,"" Scarborough said. ""And of course they hatch their conspiracy theory by giving Mark Zuckerberg money, by going on Facebook. Now that's bad enough, right? But Mark Zuckerberg is promoting the extremism because Mark Zuckerberg is actually -- his site, the Zuckerberg site -- has actually set up ad promotions that actually push people towards extremist sites that kill federal officers."" The Tech Transparency Project, a research initiative of a nonprofit watchdog group called Campaign for Accountability, released a report this spring concluding that more than 60% of the 125 identifiable Boogaloo groups on Facebook have sprung up since January, and picked up steam after the onset of the Covid-19 lockdowns. In April, a Boogaloo devotee was arrested in Texas for allegedly attempting to find and kill police officers while filming on Facebook Live, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Scarborough echoed a point that Facebook critics have made for some time: Facebook makes money when people engage with its platform, regardless of -- or, as Scarborough argues, because of -- the fact that many posts on Facebook are false, incendiary, misleading or purposeful misinformation. Zuckerberg said last week he was ""disgusted"" by Trump's remarks on the nationwide protests against racial injustice. He said Trump's Facebook posts were divisive rhetoric, but he refused to take them off the site, because Facebook wants to inform people about their politicians' views. Yet Facebook has struggled to keep hateful speech off its platform -- whether or not it's from politicians. ""Extremist groups and demagogic, authoritarian-type politicians here and across the world are now using these sites to promote hatred, to kill federal officers and to undermine American democracy,"" Scarborough said. ""Those people are becoming billionaires, and for Mark Zuckerberg to say he's sad because he's making billions of dollars over lies being spread off of hate groups germinating on Zuckerberg's website and [Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl] Sandberg's website, it is so disingenuous."" Scarborough called on politicians to act to hold Facebook accountable, tweeting his support for a potential Trump administration proposal that, according to the Wall Street Journal, would strip social media companies of some protections granted to them by Congress in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. That law prevents Internet companies from being held responsible for the actions of people who engage with their platforms. Trump has been threatening to strip away Section 230 protections for what he sees as anti-conservative bias in social networks. Twitter (TWTR) said some of Trump's tweets about mail-in voting and about the protests violated their policies, angering the president. But Scarborough argued repealing Section 230 would hold Facebook and its leaders to account for hate speech and other activities, including allowing Trump to continue to repeatedly imply on social media that Scarborough was responsible for a former staffer's death. ""If Congress doesn't do something to make Mark Zuckerberg liable and to make Mark Zuckerberg's website liable for the hatred and the lies and the libel that has been spread on his website, then American democracy will remain at risk,"" Scarborough argued. ""Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg are only interested in protecting their billions. And so when you find that a federal officer is mowed down by a right-wing extremist group, and it's Mark Zuckerberg whose platform is promoting that group by pushing people to that group, then his words are meaningless."" Facebook did not respond to a request for comment. "
73,Analysis: Why McConnell could be in for a long run in the minority if GOP lose in 2020,"On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell went public with what has long been suspected: He has no plans to leave the Senate even if his party loses its majority in November.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:51:21 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/m9Z08hFDzG0/index.html,"On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell went public with what has long been suspected: He has no plans to leave the Senate even if his party loses its majority in November. ""I do,"" McConnell tersely responded to Politico when asked if he would seek to stay as the highest-ranking Republican in the Senate no matter what happens in the 2020 election. (All of that assumes that McConnell is reelected to a seventh term in November, and his colleagues are willing to support him as leader going forward. Both seem likely at least at the moment.) Obviously, McConnell would prefer to spend his next few years in the Senate as the majority leader. But if Republicans lose the majority this fall -- a prospect that looks decidedly plausible at the moment -- then McConnell seems likely to spend much of his eighth decade as the head of the minority rather than the majority. The reason for that reality is simple: While the 2020 Senate map isn't great for Republicans, the 2022 map is far worse -- making it extremely likely that if the GOP loses the majority this fall they may not have a real chance to regain it for at least two more election cycles. The 2020 map is daunting on its face. Republicans have to defend 23 seats to just 12 for Democrats. But of those 23 GOP-held seats, Hillary Clinton carried only two -- Colorado and Maine in 2016. (Clinton won Maine's statewide electoral votes but Donald Trump got a single electoral vote for carrying the state's second district.) Which means that for Democrats to win back the majority, they need to net three seats (if Joe Biden wins the White House) or four seats (if President Donald Trump wins re-election) in states that are generally friendly to their party. The road to the majority in 2020 for Democrats runs though places like Arizona, North Carolina, Iowa, Montana and maybe even Kansas. It's not terrible territory for Democrats. But it's not friendly territory either. And while they don't have many problem seats of their own, Democrats have to try to get Alabama Sen. Doug Jones re-elected -- an extremely difficult task in a presidential election year in such a Republican state. Now take a look at the 2022 map. Again, the raw numbers favor Democrats; Republicans have 22 seats up to just 12 for Democrats. But unlike 2020, the political tilt of those 22 Republicans seats are much more favorable to Democrats. Republicans will likely need to reelect incumbents in Pennsylvania, Florida, Wisconsin -- three very swing-y seats. In addition, they could well be facing difficult open-seat races in North Carolina (Sen. Richard Burr said that his 2016 reelection race would be his last) and Iowa (Sen. Chuck Grassley would be 89 if he ran for an eighth term in 2022). And two races involving appointed Republican senators -- Arizona's Martha McSally and Kelly Loeffler in Georgia -- in 2020 will also be on the 2022 ballot. (Both are running this November for the unexpired two years on the terms they filled.) If Democrats come up short against Loeffler or McSally -- or both -- this November, you can be sure the party will heavily target them in 2022, as they represent states where demographic changes are moving in Democrats' favor. Conversely, Democrats have almost no weakness among the dozen of their incumbents set to be on the ballot in 2022. The only obvious targets are Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto (Nevada) and Maggie Hassan (New Hampshire) as both are in their first terms in the Senate and represent swing-ish states. But neither is likely to get caught unawares, and both are regarded as solid politicians. Beyond that duo, Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet might be a GOP target. But even if Democrats are hit with retirements or open seats -- California Sen. Kamala Harris might be vice president by the time her term comes up in 2022, while Sen. Patrick Leahy will be 82 years old -- those vacancies are in solidly Democratic states. Add it all up and you get this: If McConnell and Republicans lose the Senate majority this November, they might not have a realistic chance to win it back until 2025. Which is a long time for McConnell to wait to regain his position of power. "
74,Analysis: Kayleigh McEnany just compared an indoor Trump rally to ... baseball,"Faced with rising questions and criticism of President Donald Trump's decision to hold an indoor campaign rally Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany sought to defend her boss by making a comparison to the national pastime.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:07:29 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/fXSniskMe5k/index.html,"Faced with rising questions and criticism of President Donald Trump's decision to hold an indoor campaign rally Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany sought to defend her boss by making a comparison to the national pastime. ""When you come to the rally, as in any event, you assume a personal risk,"" she said. ""That is just what you do. When you go to a baseball game, you assume a risk. That's part of life. It's the personal decision of Americans as to whether to go to the rally or whether not to go to the rally."" Except that going to a baseball game and running the risk of being hit with a baseball in the stands, which presumably is what McEnany is referencing in her quote, isn't at all the same thing as attending a political rally during the coronavirus pandemic. Though it should be obvious, let's break down why: 1) Baseball is played outside: The Tulsa rally is inside. We know that the danger of catching coronavirus is significantly heightened by being indoors for an extended period of time. ""We know that being outdoors is lower risk for coronavirus transmission than being indoors,"" epidemiologist Julia L. Marcus told The New York Times last month. 2) Being hit by a batted ball is very rare: According to comprehensive study by NBC News, 808 people had been hit by batted balls while in the stands in Major League Baseball games between 2012 and 2019. If you take the attendance of all games in 2019 -- 68 million -- and multiply it by eight seasons, you get 544 million fans over those years. Which means that .00001% of the people who attend games get hit by a baseball. By contrast, there are now 2.1 million cases of coronavirus in the United States. Which, with a population of roughly 330 million, means that .6% of the population has it or has had it. And, because math .6% is a LOT greater than .00001%. 3) Being hit by a batted ball doesn't kill many people: In August 2018 at Dodger Stadium, a woman was hit with a batted ball in the stands and died four days later. It was the first death of a fan as a result of being hit with a batted ball in more than 50 years. By comparison, coronavirus -- since its arrival in the United States earlier this year -- has caused more than 117,000 deaths, with projections that it could be responsible for 200,000 fatalities by October. Globally, coronavirus has killed more than 445,000 people. 4) Being hit by a batted ball isn't contagious: If you happen to be one of the unlucky people to be struck by a batted ball at a professional baseball game, it's at best unpleasant. But even if you suffer an injury more serious than a bruise and even have to be hospitalized, you can't pass on your getting struck by a ball to your relatives who come visit you or the doctors who treat you. Because being hit by a baseball is not an infectious disease. Coronavirus, on the other hand, is an infectious disease. And from what we know of it, pretty highly transmissible particularly in indoor spaces. As you can see, there's simply no comparison. Not to mention the fact that pro baseball isn't even being played right now -- although some reports suggest that is about to change! McEnany -- and Trump -- make regular use of these apples-to-astronauts comparisons, believing, I guess, that it helps them make the case to the average person. But spend five seconds thinking about it and you quickly see why being hit with a baseball at a game isn't even close to the same thing as going to a campaign rally in a state (and a city!) where coronavirus cases are on the rise. Like, not in the same, uh, ballpark. "

In late July Dr. Trump will publish a book, ominously titled, ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man."" Most readers won't need any more clues about her subject -- her uncle, President Trump. But those who do could consult the cover, which features a photo of a young Trump before he became the figure who now lumbers upon the world stage and lurks in so many nightmares. Three and a half years into the Trump era, endless words have been spent illustrating the chaotic and cruel personality that can, to cite just one example, schedule a huge ego-gratifying rally in the middle of a deadly pandemic caused by a viciously contagious virus. According to her publisher, Mary Trump will bring her special perspective -- insider, psychologist, writer -- to bear on incidents and information never before revealed.  Having devoted years to the study of the man and the Trump clan, I can say that the bits teased so far suggest that Mary Trump has the goods. To begin with, she's the daughter of the President's eldest sibling, Fred Trump Jr., who may have been the original victim of Donald Trump's bullying. As publisher Simon and Schuster put it: ""She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donald's place in the family spotlight and Ivana's penchant for regifting to her grandmother's frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump's favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer's."" Warm and easygoing, Fred was, by all accounts, ill-suited to play the role of cutthroat real estate baron, which was what his father expected of him. Happy to step in, Donald did all he could to prove that he was the more deserving son. When Fred Jr. finally ceded first position among the heirs to the family business, he became an airline pilot. Donald mocked his profession. ""What's the difference between what you do,"" he would ask, ""and driving a bus?"" After Fred Jr. died at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, Donald turned his death into an object lesson that reflected well on himself. Donald pointedly abstained from tobacco and alcohol because of his brother's struggle, saying, ""I watched him. And I learned from him."" The cruelty didn't stop with Fred Jr.'s death in 1981. Later, when the paterfamilias Fred Trump Sr. died, heirs learned that his will distributed his estate among his children and their offspring ""other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr."" The children of Fred Jr. sued, noting that an earlier will, written prior to Fred Sr. being diagnosed with dementia, had granted them proper shares. Soon after the suit was filed, Donald changed a health insurance policy, taking away coverage for a disabled infant born to Fred's own son, Fred III.  (A second telling anecdote from author Harry Hurt III, who has written about the Trumps, describes Donald briefly considering evicting his brother and sisters from their rent-free homes in a Trump building unless they paid cash for the property.) When asked in 2000 whether withdrawing the child's insurance was cold-hearted, the man who claimed to be a billionaire said, ""I can't help that. It's cold when someone sues my father."" The suit was settled and the baby was again insured, but 16 years later, when he was running for president, Donald Trump seemingly had no regrets. Asked about the incident, he said, ""I was angry because they sued."" For those who know the family lore, the circle is completed by a little anecdote published in Hurt's 1993 book ""Lost Tycoon."" Hurt reports overhearing Fred Trump Sr. talking about his son Donald and his wife Mary flying off together. ""I hope their plane crashes,"" said Fred, adding that then ""all my problems will be solved."" Reports on the upcoming book suggest that the author will share juicy stories she learned from the President's sister, Maryanne Barry. It wouldn't be the first time that Barry, perhaps inadvertently, revealed something true about her brother. Speaking with writer Gwenda Blair in 1990, Barry shared a story about when Donald was a young man and turned a game of catch with Barry's seven year-old son into a cruel contest. ""Donald kept throwing it faster and faster, harder and harder, until I hear this crack and the ball hit David's head. Donald had to beat the seven year-old."" This cold-hearted nature followed him into his political career. As president, Donald Trump has treated the children of asylum-seeking immigrants with great cruelty, separating them from their parents and locking them in cages. During our current pandemic, with over 116,000 dead in the US and more succumbing every hour, he has been so cavalier as to advocate dangerous unproven cures.   In my own experience as a Trump biographer I have answered questions about the origins of the President's weird ways by citing both genetics and his upbringing. This nature-and-nurture answer is a bit of a cop-out, but it is the best I have been able to muster after studying the man and his family. Because she has lived close to the source and possesses real expertise in mental health, Mary Trump's opinion matters greatly to those seeking answers. I can't wait to read her book. "
76,Reward for missing soldier grows to over $50K,"The search for Vanessa Guillen has intensified and the reward to help find the missing Fort Hood soldier has more than doubled to $55,000, with celebrities voicing their support.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:39:27 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/E8m_DGf5n2A/index.html,"The search for Vanessa Guillen has intensified and the reward to help find the missing Fort Hood soldier has more than doubled to $55,000, with celebrities voicing their support. Guillen, 20, was last seen in the parking lot of her barracks at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas on April 22, according to a news release from the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command (CID). The Army initially offered a $15,000 reward for information leading to her whereabouts, but it has since increased the reward to up to $25,000. ""We are completely committed to finding Vanessa and aggressively going after every single piece of credible information and every lead in this investigation,"" Chris Grey, spokesman for Army CID said in a statement released Monday. ""We will not stop until we find Vanessa."" The $25,000 was matched by the prominent Latino civil rights organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), on Tuesday. ""This young lady put on the uniform to serve our country. The least we can do is find out where she is now and what we can do to help her,"" LULAC National President Domingo Garcia said during a virtual news conference Tuesday. The search for Guillen, who is of Hispanic descent, has captured the attention of both local and national celebrities. Houston rapper Baby Bash vowed to add an additional $5,000 to the reward in a Facebook post last week. And actress Salma Hayek pledged to put Guillen's photo on her Instagram stories every day until she is found. Allegations of sexual harassment Before Guillen went missing, she had told her family that she was being sexually harassed by one of her sergeants at Fort Hood, according to the website her family set up to promote the search. She did not identify the sergeant. ""We have to take a deep dive on this case to find Vanessa but to get to the bottom of anything that may be going on at Fort Hood,"" Texas Rep. Sylvia Garcia said in Tuesday's news conference. ""These allegations of sexual assault, that is not the first time we hear of allegations of sexual assault in the armed services."" The Army CID, however, said it has found ""no credible information or report"" that Guillen was sexually assaulted or that her case is connected to the disappearance of Gregory Wedel-Morales, another soldier who went missing last year while driving his car in Killeen, Texas. Last seen wearing a black t-shirt Guillen, a private first class, was last seen wearing a black t-shirt and purple fitness-type pants, according to the Army CID. Her car keys, room key, identification card and wallet were later found in the armory room where she was working earlier that day. Guillen is described as 5 feet 2 inches, 126 pounds with black hair and brown eyes, according to the Army CID statement. She has tattoos of a cross with a flower on her left arm, a flower also on her left arm and a mountain with a circle on her upper left shoulder, according to her family's website. Officials ask that anyone with information regarding her whereabouts call the Army CID special agents or military police. "
77,Is this double-decker seat the future of airplane travel?,A design that reconfigures airplane cabins with double-decker lie-flat seats in premium economy is being touted as a possible solution for fliers looking for more protection from the spread of Covid-19.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:19:57 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8JCVSm9w1NE/index.html," — A design that reconfigures airplane cabins with double-decker lie-flat seats in premium economy is being touted as a possible solution for fliers looking for more protection from the spread of Covid-19. Zephyr Seat is the vision of designer Jeffrey O'Neill, who reckons the isolation from fellow passengers that his creation will offer could be a game changer in the wake of the pandemic. ""We believe that new types of travelers will require privacy or will want to pay extra for that as much as they would pay for the ability to sleep,"" O'Neill, the founder and CEO of start-up Zephyr Aerospace, tells CNN Travel. With Zephyr Seat, airlines could provide double-decker seating in a 2-4-2 configuration which, O'Neill says, would allow the majority of global airlines to maintain the same seating density as offered by their existing premium economy cabins. O'Neill was inspired by a sleepless flight between New York to Singapore a few years ago, on board what was then the world's longest commercial flight. Seated in premium economy,O'Neill realized halfway through the super long-haul journey that he wasn't going to get any shut eye. ""I'm on probably the best rated airline in the world, and I'm getting wonderful service and the food is edible, but I can't sleep,"" he recalls. ""This is really uncomfortable. Why is it so difficult to find an affordable way to lie flat on a flight that's 19 hours?"" Real estate on an airplane is expensive -- and airlines usually don't want to sacrifice space. But O'Neill found himself remembering a long-distance bus journey he'd made on a trip through Argentina. The bus utilized bunk beds, and he'd slept far better than on his ostensibly more luxurious air journey to Singapore. It occurred to him that maybe that was the solution. This was two years ago, and O'Neill says his idea's since graduated from a back of a napkin drawing he dreamed up with his design partner, to a life-size mockup, which he says proves its feasibility. Double decker seating Zephyr's double-decker concept utilizes the space that exists between a standard seat and an overhead bin. ""We basically retrofitted a whole other seat on top of another,"" explains O'Neill. ""So it's essentially two levels, it's not as tall off the ground as people might imagine, it's only four and a half feet off the ground from the entry point to the lower seat to the upper seat."" The result, O'Neill says, is more passenger leg room without the airline being forced to sacrifice space or reduce passenger headcount. The idea's still in its infancy, although O'Neill says he's identified an engineering partner -- and he's been in conversation with four major airlines, including US carrier Delta, although there are no firm commitments right now. He presented the idea to airline executives at the 2019 Airline Interiors Expo at Hamburg, Germany -- and said got some valuable feedback on how to make the seat a feasible option for the mid-range aviation market. The next stage would be passing the product through the required safety tests, which could be a three-year process. New aviation opportunities Of course, a question mark currently hangs over aviation's future, with no one quite knowing what air travel is going to look like over the next few months, let alone years. There will likely be a greater demand for on board social distancing, from both passengers and airlines -- recent flights have proven that current inflight set ups make this tricky. O'Neill reckons that the new aviation landscape fits with his vision for Zephyr Seat. The increased privacy the seat would offer, he says, could reassure travelers demanding on board social distancing. That said, the concept, like other ideas in the pipeline, doesn't totally solve the issue of being in close proximity on aircraft and the potential Covid risk. O'Neill also points towards a future where there could likely be fewer scheduled flights and those that are operating could be busier and more expensive -- something we're already seeing happen. ""The price for a business class or first class seat is going to be out of range for probably about 85% of all travelers, which means a more affordable option might become a reality or a consideration for a lot of those people,"" he says."

Responding officers went to Rosas' house, but he wasn't there. The officers said they eventually found him when they went back to the scene and saw that his hands, legs and bare feet were covered in blood. Rosas was transported to a nearby hospital, the report said, adding that ""alcohol impairment is believed to be a factor in the collision."" ""We are aware of the situation and have been in contact with Aldrick,"" the Giants said in a statement to CNN on Wednesday. ""We have no further comment at this time."" In three seasons with the Giants, the 25-year-old has made 62 of 75 field goals (82.7%) and 86 of 94 extra points (91.5%). He made the Pro Bowl in 2018.

The ""Parks and Recreation"" star has been in Hollywood for so long that he has multiple friend groups, including with people most folks aren't even aware he knows. Thomas definitely falls into that latter category, and Lowe talked about it with Conan O'Brien on a recent episode of the late-night show host's podcast, ""Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend."" Lowe was discussing his new podcast, ""Literally! With Rob Lowe,"" and said that since he's been in the industry for 40 years, he has a diverse group of buds to invite on as guests. ""It could be Brat Pack people, it could be 'West Wing' people, 'Parks and Rec' people,"" Lowe said. ""It could be people (that) people are surprised I'm friends with... It's going to be really, really fun."" When O'Brien asked for the name of someone folks would be surprised about, Lowe named Thomas -- much to O'Brien's amazement. The ""Mental Samurai"" host explained that the pair met years ago after Lowe got inducted into a Horatio Alger organization, which he described as ""a very exclusive, very amazing society that provides scholarships for kids who come from just terrible, terrible backgrounds but they're the best and the brightest in their classes."" ""And the society of people in it are pretty studly, he's one of them,"" Lowe said. ""That's how we met. They put the medal on me in the halls of the Supreme Court."" Thomas put the medal on him, Lowe said, and it kicked off their friendship. Thomas gave Lowe his cell number and told him he could call anytime, which the actor did when his son was going to law school, Lowe said. ""I call this cell phone and he answers it,"" Lowe said. ""And you're like, 'Geez. Shouldn't there be, like, a vetting process?' And 45 minutes, he's giving me advice on what my son should do vis-a-vis law school and clerking."" "
80,'Pandemic pricing' is here. Rents are dropping across the US,"At the end of May, Ilana Freund landed a deal on an apartment in New York City where she will be attending graduate school. She and her roommate signed a lease on a two-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $4,995 a month. It was a significant discount: Similar apartments in the building were going for around $5,300 before the pandemic took hold, according to the listing agent.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:13:32 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/GzNemmCQ8OQ/index.html,"At the end of May, Ilana Freund landed a deal on an apartment in New York City where she will be attending graduate school. She and her roommate signed a lease on a two-bedroom apartment in the West Village for $4,995 a month. It was a significant discount: Similar apartments in the building were going for around $5,300 before the pandemic took hold, according to the listing agent. The two roommates were also given one month's rent free and did not have to pay a broker fee, which typically would have cost them 12% to 15% of the annual rent. ""It has been crazy,"" Freund said, ""but we definitely got a very good deal."" ""Pandemic pricing,"" as some agents call it, has arrived across the country as landlords react to the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. With many people either losing their jobs or working from home due to the shutdowns, many tenants have chosen to leave their apartments behind in major US cities. And that has pushed rental prices lower in many places across the US. In May, according to apartment listing platform Zumper, the top four most expensive cities -- San Francisco, New York, Boston and San Jose -- all saw rents on median one-bedroom apartments decline from a year ago. In San Francisco, the median rent for one-bedrooms is down 9% from last year to $3,360 and two-bedrooms are down 6% to $4,420, according to Zumper. ""I'm seeing rents are down 10% to 20%, with higher-end and luxury units taking the biggest hits,"" said Dave Chesnosky, an agent with Compass in San Francisco. ""But these drops are dependent on the location and uniqueness of a unit."" Rents are dropping at the high end of the market first as people who are ""renters by choice"" bail on their apartments, said Jeff Adler, vice president and general manager at Yardi Matrix, which tracks the leasing industry. ""Younger, single professionals who weren't attached to the city they were living in said, 'If everything is shut down, why should I stay here? I'll go back home.' Or they doubled up with someone else,"" he said. As more apartments become available, owners have been forced to reduce their rent to increase interest, he said. This has a cascading effect throughout the market as people in the price bracket below find these deals -- perhaps a better apartment for the same price or even less -- and vacate their own apartments. ""If you have a job and a stable income, now is not a bad time to look around and see if you can improve your circumstances,"" said Adler. Steeper drops at higher end In Manhattan, the rents on the highest priced apartments are falling fastest. The median rent for a luxury apartment in May was $7,825 a month, a 10% drop from April, according to a report from brokerage firm Douglas Elliman and appraiser Miller Samuel. The median rent for all Manhattan apartments in May was $3,546, down 3% from April. ""No one is surprised the prices have come down slightly,"" said Hal Gavzie, executive director of leasing at Douglas Elliman in New York City. ""Landlords are doing whatever they can to get vacant apartments filled."" New leases typically spike in May, but last month they were down 62% from the year before, according to the Douglas Elliman report. This is partly due to the shutdown, which prevents rental agents from showing apartments in New York City, said Gavzie. But, he said, more apartments are also available because people just up and left their leases. While many left when the pandemic shut down the city, others left later when the protests over the killing of George Floyd began, Gavzie said. Gavzie said that presents a rare opportunity for those staying in the city. ""Right now is probably when you'll get the best deals you're going to find,"" said Gavzie. ""Once we are able to show apartments in New York, the inventory will diminish and there will be more competition."" During their apartment search, Freund said she and her roommate saw incentives on other rentals as well and every listing they saw waived the broker fee. Plus, the lower rents allowed Freund and her roommate to expand their wish list. ""We wanted to at least have laundry in the building,"" she said. ""As prices were decreasing, we realized we could get laundry in the unit. That was such a win."" New wish list: home office, outdoor space In New York, realistic landlords who provide flexible lease starts, pay the broker's fee or offer incentives are the ones finding renters, said Kristina Paces, an agent at Douglas Elliman. Paces, who leases buildings in lower Manhattan, said landlords she works with have increased their incentives from one month of free rent, to two months with a 12-month lease. In May, 42% of new leases had an owner-paid incentive, up from 35% in April, according to the Douglas Elliman/Miller Samuel report. ""No one is walking in saying, 'Great, I'd love to pay full price,' in this Covid-19 environment,"" she said. What people are willing to pay more for in a rental apartment building is changing as well, said Paces. All those buildings with fancy amenities were competing with each other to offer gyms, pools and movie lounges. Not only are the perks not enticing anyone right now, many aren't even open or usable. Most in demand now: home-office space, an in-unit washer and dryer and outdoor space, said Paces. ""People's offices are closed until January and they are taking that into consideration when looking for apartments."" After being indoors for so many months, outdoor space has become an especially attractive luxury. ""It is a premium. Those apartments are going first,"" she said. ""In a normal market, you think, I might use that a bit, but now you know you'll use it a lot."" "

Known as the V-Sabre logo, the old design featured two crossed sabres with serpentine handles. The handles were a reference to serpentine walls on the UVA campus that were originally constructed to keep enslaved people out of public view. The new logo removes the serpentine curves on the sabre handles in favor of smooth handles. UVA Athletic Director Carla Williams announced the changes on Monday. The previous version of the logo was released two months ago when the university updated its logos and introduced new typography and numerals. ""After the release of our new logos on April 24th, I was made aware of the negative connotation between the serpentine walls and slavery,"" Williams said in a statement. ""I was not previously aware of the historical perspective indicating the original eight-foot-high walls were constructed to mask the institution of slavery and enslaved laborers from public view."" The original wavy walls were built in the 1820s and eventually removed to create more space around the university's historical pavilions, according to a statement from the school's athletics department. New walls were constructed in the 1950s. The curved handles were featured in both the V-Sabre logo, the primary logo for Virginia athletics, and the Cavalier Shield mark, a secondary logo for use on apparel and on social media. ""Over the last few weeks, I have worked to better educate myself and that education will continue,"" Williams said. ""There was no intent to cause harm, but we did, and for that I apologize to those who bear the pain of slavery in our history."" "

The moves are an acknowledgment of the brands' origins in racist stereotypes, a consideration brought to the forefront during the nationwide reckoning on race following the death of George Floyd in police custody. According to the Uncle Ben's website, the name was first used in 1946 in reference to a black farmer known as Uncle Ben who excelled in rice-growing. The man depicted in the logo is a ""a beloved Chicago chef and waiter named Frank Brown."" However, the imagery evokes a servant and uses a title that reflects how white Southerners ""once used 'uncle' and 'aunt' as honorifics for older blacks because they refused to say 'Mr.' and 'Mrs.,'"" according to a 2007 New York Times article.

Aunt Jemima's appearance has evolved over time. The brand's origin and logo is based off the song ""Old Aunt Jemima"" from a minstrel show performer and reportedly sung by slaves. The company's website said the logo started in 1890 and was based on Nancy Green, a ""storyteller, cook and missionary worker."" However, the website fails to mention Green was born into slavery.

In a 2015 opinion piece published in The New York Times, Cornell University professor Riché Richardson said the logo is ""very much linked to Southern racism."" Richardson said the Aunt Jemima logo is based on a ""'mammy,' a devoted and submissive servant who eagerly nurtured the children of her white master and mistress while neglecting her own."" A statue of a slave mammy stereotype was approved by the US Senate in 1923, but it was never built. The company also ran racist ads for several decades, with actresses personifying the mammy stereotype. It evolved the logo over the years, and even hired singer Gladys Knight as a spokeswoman in the 1990s. Today, Aunt Jemima describes itself as brand that stands for ""warmth, nourishment and trust — qualities you'll find in loving moms from diverse backgrounds who want the very best for their families."" In 2017, the husband of the late B. Smith called on the company to change it and said it was the epitome of ""female humiliation.""

Pepsi (PEP) hasn't yet revealed a new logo or brand name for the breakfast items. That will debut in the fall. The Aunt Jemima brand was purchased by Quaker Oats in 1926.

84,Why Ben & Jerry's statement on white supremacy is so extraordinary,Let there be no doubt where Ben & Jerry's stands.,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:02:22 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/7ueXAct21pc/index.html,"London Let there be no doubt where Ben & Jerry's stands. The ice cream maker has called on Americans to ""dismantle white supremacy"" and ""grapple with the sins of our past"" as nationwide protests against racial injustice stretch into their eighth day. In a forceful statement posted to the company's website late on Tuesday, Ben & Jerry's describes the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer as the result of ""inhumane police brutality that is perpetuated by a culture of white supremacy."" ""What happened to George Floyd was not the result of a bad apple; it was the predictable consequence of a racist and prejudiced system and culture that has treated Black bodies as the enemy from the beginning,"" said the brand, which is owned by Unilever (UL). Companies including Nike (NKE), Netflix (NFLX), Twitter (TWTR), Disney (DIS), Facebook (FB) and Intel (INTC) have condemned racism and injustice in recent days. But the statement from Ben & Jerry's is unusually comprehensive and direct, addressing the historical roots of discrimination in the United States and calling out systemic racism, while advocating specific policies to prevent further police abuses and redress racial inequality. ""Slavery, Jim Crow and segregation were systems of legalized and monetized white supremacy for which generations of Black and Brown people paid an immeasurable price. That cost must be acknowledged and the privilege that accrued to some at the expense of others must be reckoned with and redressed,"" the company said in its statement. Ben & Jerry's, which also publicly supported the Black Lives Matter movement, called on President Donald Trump to disavow white supremacists and nationalist groups that ""overtly support him."" The ice cream maker also called for the US Department of Justice to reinvigorate its Civil Rights Division, and for Congress to pass H.R. 40, a bill that would create a commission to study the effects of discrimination since African slaves first arrived in North America in 1619 and recommend remedies. Ben & Jerry's has a long history of political activism under founders Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who were arrested in 2016 for protesting against money in politics. The company's sale to British-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever (UL) in 2000 has not prevented it from speaking out on issues such as racial injustice, climate change and refugee rights. As part of the deal, Ben & Jerry's kept an independent board of directors. ""We're a wholly owned subsidiary [of Unilever], but we still act according to Ben & Jerry's mission, vision and values,"" a spokesperson told CNN Business. The brand has even used its ice cream to lobby for change, launching the Justice ReMix'd flavor in September to promote criminal justice reform and Pecan Resist in 2018 to protest Trump administration policies it described as ""regressive and discriminatory."" The company was praised by activists on social media for the strength of its statement on Floyd's death. ""Unless and until white America is willing to collectively acknowledge its privilege, take responsibility for its past and the impact it has on the present, and commit to creating a future steeped in justice, the list of names that George Floyd has been added to will never end. We have to use this moment to accelerate our nation's long journey towards justice and a more perfect union,"" the statement concluded. Unilever CEO Alan Jope also commented on the issue. ""Systemic racism and social injustice have to be eradicated. Business has a critical role to play in creating an equitable society which is intolerant of intolerance,"" he said Monday on Twitter. "
85,Walmart ends practice of locking up black hair care products sold at its stores,Walmart says it will no longer store multicultural cosmetic products in security cases inside its stores.,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 13:01:44 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/v1qtq9YsEz8/index.html,"New York Walmart says it will no longer store multicultural cosmetic products in security cases inside its stores. The nation's largest retailer announced the new policy on Wednesday, a few days after a black woman in Montbello, Colorado, shared a video on social media showing the different ways her local Walmart (WMT) displayed hair care products for blacks and all other hair care products. In the video, mainstream shampoos and conditioners commonly used by white people are on open shelves while products designed for black people's hair are stored in locked plastic cases. ""White privilege also extends to haircare products, apparently, in Walmart,"" the woman says in the video. ""There are black and brown people all over the place. The message is clear: We don't trust you."" The story was first reported by KCNC. The differential treatment for ethnic products sold at Walmart stores has been raised on social media by Walmart customers multiple times in recent years. It was also the subject of a discrimination lawsuit against Walmart that was dropped last year, in which the plaintiffs argued storing black products in security cases implied black people were more likely to shoplift. In its announcement, Walmart said it will stop storing multicultural haircare and beauty products in security cases, but noted most of its stores never did it in the first place. ""We're sensitive to the issue and understand the concerns raised by our customers and members of the community and have made the decision to discontinue placing multicultural hair care and beauty products -- a practice in place in about a dozen of our 4,700 stores nationwide -- in locked cases,"" the company said in a statement. Walmart said the cases were put in place to deter shoplifters, and that the company does not tolerate discrimination. The news comes during a period of rapid policy changes among major companies that have expressed solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Worldwide protests and riots have taken place in the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month. On Thursday, Microsoft said it would stop selling facial recognition technology to US police departments following similar announcements made by Amazon and IBM. On Wednesday, NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from being displayed at its events. "
86,'Unorthodox': The dress codes of Orthodox Jewish women and their diverse interpretations,"Based on the true story of Deborah Feldman, a Jewish woman who left the Satmar community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in search of a new life, the hit Netflix series ""Unorthodox"" has brought Hasidic culture -- and its female dress codes -- into mainstream focus. One of the most talked about aspects of the show is the clothing, which shapes lead character Esty's (played by Shira Haas) story from beginning to end.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 11:27:41 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Wbf-NBMIp9w/index.html,"Based on the true story of Deborah Feldman, a Jewish woman who left the Satmar community in Williamsburg, Brooklyn in search of a new life, the hit Netflix series ""Unorthodox"" has brought Hasidic culture -- and its female dress codes -- into mainstream focus. One of the most talked about aspects of the show is the clothing, which shapes lead character Esty's (played by Shira Haas) story from beginning to end. The show's costume designer Justine Seymour spent hours on meticulous research, including a week-long stint within the Satmar community in New York. ""I consider one of the biggest gifts of my job to be that it is very creative, but also very educational,"" she said during a phone interview. ""You do have to be sensitive, respectful, and informed when you are observing a very closed community,"" said Seymour, who is not Jewish. She said she discovered that the women she met during her research embraced designer brands for shoes, headscarves and handbags. ""Kate Spade, Chanel, Ferragamo and Hermes were the stand-out designers,"" she said, that ""add a bit of glamour to the conservative dress code."" Whether scouring second-hand stores for silk scarves (she said she purchased over 100 for the show) or building faux-fur shtreimels (hats worn by married Hasidic men usually made from mink) from scratch, Seymour said she worked hard to ensure that each costume would adhere to Orthodox Jewish laws, but also celebrate the nuances of individual style. Orthodox dressing can often be perceived by outsiders as overly restrictive, and as leaving little room for individual freedom and self-expression. Feldman and the fictional character of Esty both struggled with the pressures put on them by their communities, which extended to their appearance, but all three of the Jewish women interviewed for this article felt that there's more freedom to explore one's personal style than people might assume -- particularly within less conservative households or branches -- and many devout women do play with fashion to reflect their personal taste, while staying within the religious dress codes they have chosen to follow. Orthodox Judaism encompasses many traditions and customs, with the Hasidim of Williamsburg being just one ultra-observant group. And while women living in this particular community tend to subscribe to more stringent rules for getting dressed, modern Orthodox followers, for example, choose to interpret some of the core principles differently. Specific style codes vary from community to community, with clothing often dictated by practicality or religious occasion -- Shabbat, Yom Tov (meaning holiday), weddings and bar mitzvahs -- as much as personal taste. But no matter where you are or whatever the occasion, in the Orthodox Jewish world, what to wear is governed by the concept of modesty, called tzniut in Hebrew and tznius in Yiddish. From Tel Aviv to Massachusetts, it is with tznius in mind that clothing is chosen. Tamara Fulton, a fashion stylist and lifestyle editor, who is married to an Orthodox rabbi and lives in London, explained:  ""There are lots of different Jewish communities all over the world with much diversity yet the underlying principles they share are the same. Tznius is the word in Judaism that is slightly mistranslated to mean simply 'modesty,' but it's not just about modest dressing. Tznius applies to both men and women, and is based upon the concept of humility. It's really about how you are in the world, and how you carry yourself in a reserved but dignified manner,"" said Fulton. This usually means the following for Orthodox women: trousers are not worn, and skirts and dresses must fall below the knee, including when sitting; arms are covered to the elbow, and necklines are high-cut. Often clothing is altered -- with slits in skirts sewn up and false necklines added. Layering is also often used to create final looks. Once married, covering your hair is another one of the key principles of tznius. Not all women will shave their real hair, as Esty does during one of the most memorable scenes of ""Unorthodox"" (her hair is in fact shaved for her). But many observant women will either wear a scarf or a sheitel, the Yiddish word for wig. A Jewish teacher who taught in Israel in a girls' seminary and also lived in the Haredi, or ultra-Orthodox, community in Manchester in the north of England agreed to be interviewed for this article, but asked not to be named for reasons of modesty. She wears a sheitel herself and explained that they can often be used as an accessory or as a way to change up your look. Over the phone she said: ""One (woman) I know has a selection of all different color sheitels in different styles. Because she says: 'I'm covering my head and I'm thinking of a sheitel as a hat. So if I want to be blonde one day and brunette another, why shouldn't I be?'"" The style of sheitel is also dependent on the community. For example, some Hasidic women wear shorter wigs with a hat on top, so there is no doubt they are wearing a head covering. Sheitels are made from both human and synthetic hair. When she was living in Manchester, the teacher always preferred to wear her wig made from real hair for special occasions. ""I would have real hair for Shabbat, and then synthetic for every day,"" she said. Wearing gifted jewelry on Shabbat or special occasions is also common. ""It is believed that married women should be given beautiful jewelry,"" said the teacher. ""It might be modest, but it would be of high quality."" Seymour noted that jewelry was an important component when assembling the costumes for ""Unorthodox."" She remembered having to dress around 60 women for Esty and her husband Yanky's wedding scene, all in replica diamonds and pearls. Later in this scene, the groom presents his new bride with a pair of latticed diamond earrings. ""They are very close to the earrings Deborah Feldman was given in reality,"" she said. When is comes to color, like with other cultures and religions, different colors take on different meanings, but black isn't the only color worn by Hasidic women. ""When I lived in Israel, we hardly wore black,"" said the teacher. ""It was very bright colors. But not red -- never red! As this color is not seen as modest. (In Hasidic communities) women will tend to wear navy, bottle green, browns and gray."" ""For all women, the clothes are an expression of yourself. The idea is to look smart, but not to draw too much attention to yourself,"" she explained. Orthodox women choose to buy clothing from a variety of different places -- from Jewish-owned clothing stores within their community to other non-Jewish shops or shopping centers. For Fulton, there are several go-to stores that often sell pieces that work for her. ""I prefer to wear clothes that are designed to be worn as they are, rather than layering or altering for modesty,"" she said. ""H&M and Zara are great for this."" She also noted that many high fashion designers have been producing collections that offer options for women who choose to dress modestly. ""It's really interesting to see designers like Valentino, Erdem, and McQueen, for example, produce styles that just happen to be appropriate for women who might want to dress in a more modest way. I'm a big fan of the whole 1970s revival, too, with Laura Ashley-inspired designs and brands such as The Vampire's Wife."" Another brand that has become popular with both observant and secular women alike is Batsheva. The 2018 CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund winning brand is known for its ruffled, prairie-style dresses. Established by native New Yorker Batsheva Hay, the foundations of her namesake label are centered around her own personal history and culture. Her husband, photographer Alexei Hay, began following Orthodox practices just before they started dating. At their wedding, Batsheva -- who grew up in a secular Jewish family and who is not ultra-observant of Jewish dress codes -- said men and women were separated, which is traditional, and Hay wore her mother's wedding dress, made from Mexican lace and suitable for tznius. With no formal fashion design training, Hay -- a former lawyer -- first started making clothes for herself while at home raising young children. She launched her brand in 2016. ""When I was starting Batsheva, I was finding that so many of the references that I was interested in were retro or old-fashioned,"" she said over the phone. ""Also in my (neighborhood), and in Brooklyn which is a quick subway ride away from me, I was seeing Orthodox women who dressed similarly to this."" Hay, who  said she is compelled by working within specific, pre-laid rules, but interpreting them anew. In this way, she has developed a style that is modest but also distinctive and fun. ""The goal for Orthodox Jews is not an abandonment of beauty,"" she said. ""It's supposed to be working within that to still look beautiful."" Seymour echoed this sentiment: ""With the costumes in 'Unorthodox,' I wanted to honor women all over the world who want to look beautiful without breaking the codes of modesty."" She said she was struck by the pride many of the woman in the Satmar community took in dressing well. ""If the show can inspire a little bit more glamour and beauty, and pride in the way (all women) dress, I would be overjoyed."""
87,How one gay Egyptian woman stood up to homophobia and paid the ultimate price,"In 2017, Sarah Hegazi was arrested and said she was tortured for waving a rainbow gay pride flag at a concert in Cairo. Last weekend, the 30-year-old died by suicide in Canada.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 11:28:39 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/PvbOT-VNSeQ/index.html,"In 2017, Sarah Hegazi was arrested and said she was tortured for waving a rainbow gay pride flag at a concert in Cairo. Last weekend, the 30-year-old died by suicide in Canada. Hegazi's friends reported her death, circulated a suicide note and shared an outpouring of messages of solidarity, grief and anger. Their mourning was soon hijacked by hateful messages. On social media, posts about Hegazi that ended with the traditional condolences, ""May God Have Mercy on her,"" were followed by comments saying ""she is not worthy of His Mercy,"" and a torrent of expletives targeting her sexuality. These bitter exchanges echoed a long-running clash between Egyptian progressives and conservatives that haunted Hegazi's life. She was a software developer, a ""feminist, interested in politics and a queer activist,"" fellow LGBTQ activist and friend Malak Elkashif told CNN from Cairo. By waving the flag, Hegazi became an icon for the gay community and a target for state violence. Analysts say that Egypt's government often enforces conservative values by imprisoning, torturing and silencing women, members of the LGBTQ community and other citizens who don't conform to its social norms. Earlier this year, Egypt told the UN Human Rights Council it has ""vowed to safeguard human rights, ensuring equal rights and opportunities to all citizens without discrimination,"" and it has ""thoroughly"" investigated all ""individual"" cases of torture. After conservatives criticized and filed complaints against two women for posting dancing and lip synching videos on TikTok that got hundreds of thousands of views, authorities last week charged them with the vaguely worded crime of ""violating family principles and values."" ""The regime uses its tools -- such as the media, and mosques -- to tell Egyptian society, which is understood to be 'religious by nature': We too protect religion and social morality, so there is no need for Islamists to compete with us!"" Hegazi wrote in an article published by local independent platform Mada Masr in 2018. The Egyptian state and the proponents of political Islam had put aside their long-running animosity, agreeing on using hate and prejudice to curb individual freedoms, she argued. Her writings weaved political critique into her struggle as an openly gay woman. Defiance When Hegazi and her friends raised the rainbow flag at the September 2017 concert by Mashrou' Leila, a Lebanese band with an openly gay frontman, she was hailed by allies for ""breaking many barriers of silence,"" said her friend Tarek Salama. ""To see someone who publicly say they are leftist, that they are against state violence and that they are queer, made me worried about her. But I was also fascinated and humbled,"" Salama told CNN. Photos of the colorful flag fluttering under the spotlights enraged talk show hosts and newspaper columnists. Days later, Hegazi and her friends were arrested. Police ultimately detained at least 75 people in the month following the concert in what one Egyptian rights group called an ""unprecedented upsurge in security crackdown targeting gay and transgender citizens or those believed to be so."" Sixteen years prior, in 2001, a similar crackdown took place. In what was known as the Queen Boat case, police arrested dozens of men in Cairo and charged them with ""habitual debauchery"" -- a legal term used to prosecute LGBTQ people. The men hid their faces during the public trial in fear of recognition, and reported a life ruined by the torture, shame and stigma. What set Hegazi's experience apart was her willingness to show her face despite the backlash. ""It was a day to mark in history as the start of the liberation of the LGBTQ community in Egypt,"" Elkashif said. Hegazi remained in detention for three months. She said she was tortured by electrocution and subjected to sexual harassment by female prisoners acting on the orders of officers ""who believed she had to be punished,"" she wrote on Daaarb.com, an electronic publication of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party. Egyptian authorities have repeatedly denied claims of systematic torture in prisons and did not respond to Hegazi's claims. The government didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for comment. During interrogation at the state security prosecution, which usually handles terrorism and high profile political cases, Hegazi would clutch her lawyers' arms and beg them not to let her go back to detention, her lawyer and friend Mostafa Fouad told CNN. In hours of questioning, police probed into the details of her life, she later wrote. They asked her why she took off the Islamic headscarf, which she had previously donned, and if she was a virgin. She was charged with ""promoting debauchery"" and with joining an illegal organization that ""threatens public and societal peace,"" a charge usually leveled against Islamists and political dissidents, according to Fouad. Hegazi was released pending trial to find that her family and her neighbors had rejected her and she was fired from her job. Society ""welcomed"" what happened to her, she wrote in Daaarb.com last March. ""The Egyptian middle class leans towards the socially and religiously conservative right. It supports state decisions to impose guardianship on the society ... they practice social stigma [against anyone who] revolts against this oppressive patriarchal culture that is based on oppressing women, workers, and religious and sexual minorities,"" Hegazi wrote. ""It is the loudest class in society, so exposing and criticizing it is a duty."" Her words would prove prescient in explaining her life's struggle and the unsympathetic reaction to her death. ""[The middle class] laid the foundation for hate, psychological and physical violence, sexual harassment and bullying,"" she added. Exile Hegazi traveled to Canada months after her release, but never seemed to escape what had happened. ""Sarah left Egypt two years ago, but Egypt and its trauma didn't leave her alone,"" her friend Salama wrote on Facebook. Though asylum in Canada provided safety from prison, it was taxing in other ways. Her mother died of cancer shortly after she left and her inability to be close to her and her younger siblings at the time took a toll on her, she said. She said she suffered from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks and loneliness.  The electroconvulsive therapy she underwent in Cairo and Toronto caused memory loss, she wrote in Mada Masr in 2018. She stuttered, was terrified and attempted suicide twice. Her writing, activism and support of friends facing depression and arrest continued. Her Instagram account includes posts urging patience with those battling PTSD, along with posts in solidarity with political causes from Black Lives Matter, to imprisoned friends in Egypt and the millions trapped by conflict in Idlib, Syria. ""She was strong, she could have survived this, but society destroyed her,"" Fouad recounted from his self-exile in Turkey. ""She talked me off suicide four times before,"" he said, breaking down in tears. After her death, online trolls and commenters said her advocacy for LGBTQ rights was a greater crime than her ""sinful sexuality."" ""Sarah committed a crime against religion and society by supporting homosexuality and publicizing her homosexuality and atheism,"" one user wrote on Facebook. Others used expletives and derogatory terms while arguing that she would be denied God's mercy and rot in hell. In Egypt's Twittersphere, her name was trending along with ""People of Lot,"" a reference to a Quranic passage about punishment for homosexuality. ""The most humiliating and infuriating part in her death are those gloating in it,"" her friend Amr Mohamed said in a video posted on Facebook. Addressing these people, he added, ""She died after detention, torture and expulsion ... what religion that would reward you for insulting a dead person?"" Tributes A day before her death, Hegazi posted a picture of herself lying on green grass under a bright blue sky. ""The sky is more beautiful than earth, and I want the sky, not earth,"" she wrote. Hamed Sinno, Mashrou' Leila's lead singer, put these words to music in a video tribute. ""Her blood is on my hands as much as it is on yours. It should have been me in that prison cell. I apologize if I gave anyone hope that they'll one day see us as human,"" he wrote on Facebook, also from self-exile. After her death, an older, familiar photo went viral -- the one of Hegazi wrapped in the rainbow flag, as she was perched on a friend's shoulders, her smile beaming over the crowd at the band's concert in 2017. Sinno posted the picture, writing: ""Freedom to your soul."" In the note she wrote before her death, she said: ""To my siblings, I tried to survive and I failed. Forgive me. To my friends, experiences have been cruel and I'm too weak to resist. Forgive me. To the world, you have been extremely cruel, but I forgive.""

The new limited edition Mach 1 will be powered by a version of the Mustang GT's 5.0-liter V8 engine and will produce an expected 480 horsepower. As with the original 250 horsepower Mach 1, introduced in 1969, this new car is designed to fill the gap between the standard Mustang and the much more extreme Shelby Mustangs. Power numbers have increased a lot in the intervening decades. Today's Shelby GT500, for example, produces 760 horsepower. The last Mustang Mach 1, a 2004 model, had a 305 horsepower V8. The name Mach 1 connotes supersonic flight. It is the technical term for the speed of sound, which is approximately 767 miles per hour at sea level. Ford has not announced an estimated top speed for the Mach 1, but it will, no doubt, be considerably lower than that. The Mach 1 is engineered for track driving, with better oil cooling and large air intakes. An optional package for the suspension will provide even better high-speed handling. Some engine and suspension parts from the Shelby Mustangs are used on this car. Buyers will be able to choose either a six-speed manual transmission or a 10-speed automatic. The Mach 1's body will be decorated with distinctive low-gloss racing stripes and a special Mustang pony badge in the center of the grill. Ford hasn't yet announced pricing or said how many of these cars will be produced. The new Mach 1 will be available at dealerships in the spring of 2021, Ford (F) said. "
89,Homeowners and renters catch a break: Evictions and foreclosures are on pause for another two months,"In an effort to keep homeowners and renters in their homes as they navigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums are being extended for two more months.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:23:51 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RHI0SCH-xFA/index.html,"In an effort to keep homeowners and renters in their homes as they navigate the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, federal foreclosure and eviction moratoriums are being extended for two more months. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will extend the moratorium on foreclosures and evictions on single-family homes until August 31. The protections were originally set to expire on June 30. In addition, the US Department of Housing and Urban Development will extend Federal Housing Administration loan forgiveness for homeowners with FHA-insured single-family mortgages until the end of August. The program was put in place in March with a 60-day moratorium and was later extended until the end of June. ""While the economic recovery is already underway, many American families still need more time and assistance to regain their financial footing,"" said Ben Carson, the Secretary of HUD. ""Our foreclosure and eviction extension means that these families will not have to worry about losing their home as they work to recover from the financial impacts of Covid-19."" Servicers must continue to halt new foreclosure actions and suspend foreclosure actions that were in process, as well as cease evictions of people renting FHA-backed single family properties. The only exception to the stay is for occupants of legally vacant or abandoned properties. Homeowners with FHA-insured or Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans should continue to make mortgage payments during the foreclosure and eviction moratorium if they are able to. If they cannot, they may seek mortgage payment forbearance made available through the Coronavirus Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act. Under the CARES Act, homeowners affected by coronavirus with federally-backed loans can delay or reduce payments for up to a year, and are not required to make a lump sum repayment at the end of the forbearance period. Those who don't have government-backed loans may also get forbearance, at the discretion of their lender. To better understand the protections and assistance that the government is offering homeowners and renters because of coronavirus, several agencies including HUD, FHFA and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have developed an information website, cfpb.gov/housing. ""During this national health emergency no one should worry about losing their home,"" said Federal Housing Finance Agency director Mark Calabria. "
90,"Markets may crash so badly the Fed has to start buying stocks, star investor says","The Federal Reserve is buying junk bonds and corporate debt ETFs as part of its campaign to revive the American economy. Next on its shopping list: US stocks, as Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, told CNN Business.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:31:19 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/06XprycdwxU/index.html,"New York The Federal Reserve is buying junk bonds and corporate debt ETFs as part of its campaign to revive the American economy. Next on its shopping list: US stocks, as Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners, told CNN Business. The S&P 500 has skyrocketed 40% since March 23, when the Fed announced its unprecedented experiment with junk bonds. That surge, coming in the face of the collapse of the real economy, drove up market valuations to dotcom-bubble levels. But Minerd thinks a reckoning is coming, and soon. He expects the S&P 500 will retest its March 23 low of 2,237.40 over the next month, potentially crumbling to as low as 1,600. That would mark a 49% collapse from where the index traded Tuesday during a strong rally. ""There's a point where the Federal Reserve is going to have to pull out a bazooka,"" Minerd said in an interview. ""And I think the option of buying stocks on the part of the Fed is on the table."" Should a stock market collapse happen, it would erode confidence among consumers, small businesses and CEOs alike. And it would make it harder for companies to borrow the money they need to survive because of the strong link between stock prices and corporate credit spreads. ""The Fed has basically told us they don't have a stomach for this,"" said Minerd. He warned his clients back in February -- when US stocks were rising to ever greater heights -- that there were ""red flags"" in financial markets. ""This will eventually end badly. I have never in my career seen anything as crazy as what's going on right now,"" he wrote on February 13. This isn't the first time Minerd has warned of a brewing storm. In August 2007, he said the credit squeeze at the time could morph into a recession. Stocks hit record highs that fall, before beginning an historic collapse as the Great Recession began. Fed unfroze credit markets Since the pandemic began, the US central bank has rolled out a series of emergency lending programs that make its 2008-era response look tame. Aggressive purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds have caused the Fed's balance sheet to swell to $7.2 trillion, up from $4.2 trillion at the end of 2019. Its balance sheet is now eight times larger than before the Great Recession. The goal of this massive intervention, according to Fed chief Jerome Powell, is to make sure companies and households have access to credit, the lifeblood of the economy. And it has worked so far. Struggling businesses such as Carnival (CCL) and Ford (F) that were essentially locked out of the credit markets in March were suddenly able to borrow again. Foreign central banks are already buying stocks Buying stocks would be a significant escalation in the Fed's mission to avoid a depression -- one that would face legal obstacles. Technically, the Fed does not have the legal authority to purchase stocks, although Janet Yellen, Powell's predecessor at the Fed, told CNBC in April that the US central bank should seek that power. ""I frankly don't think it's necessary at this point,"" Yellen said, ""but longer term it wouldn't be a bad thing for Congress to reconsider the powers that the Fed has with respect to assets it can own."" Some foreign central banks are already aggressively playing in the stock market. The Bank of Japan has been buying equity ETFs for a decade and is now one of the biggest owners of Japanese stocks. Switzerland's central bank owned more than $94 billion of stock as of the end of the first quarter, including large stakes worth more than $1 billion apiece in Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), according to SEC filings. The past dozen years shows the Fed is willing in a crisis to push the boundaries. ""Every time the Fed has had to face a problem where the solution is something novel or new, they've been pretty creative in coming up with ways to get it done,"" Minerd said. 'Troubling precedent' As it is, critics have argued the Fed is overstepping its mandate by scooping up corporate bonds, a step it never took during the Great Recession. The 1913 Federal Reserve Act, which created the central bank, prohibits it from buying corporate assets. To get around that, the Fed in March set up a special purpose vehicle (SPV), funded by the US Treasury and managed by BlackRock (BLK), to do the buying. The central bank cited ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" that authorizes it to launch ""broad-based"" lending facilities. The program officially launched on Tuesday. Minerd suggested a similar mechanism could allow the Fed to eventually buy stocks. A Fed spokesperson referred CNN Business to July 2019 Congressional testimony in which Powell dismissed talk of buying stocks. ""It's not an authority we are seeking, or looking at, or think we need,"" Powell said at the time. Of course, diving headfirst into the stock market would be highly controversial, raising concerns about moral hazard and unintended consequences. And it would mean the Fed could suffer losses when markets tumble, as they sometimes do. For instance, the Swiss National Bank recorded a loss of 31.9 billion Swiss francs ($33.5 billion) on stocks during the turbulent first quarter. Minerd said he's already worried the Fed's corporate bond purchases are distorting the capitalist system. ""It's a troubling precedent that the Federal Reserve is going to sit there and continue to fund these zombie companies that don't deserve to exist,"" he said. Minerd called the Fed's junk bond experiment an ""almost socialist"" program based on the notion that the government has an ""obligation to keep companies liquid and finances,"" as opposed to just keeping markets functioning. Recovery could take four years Minerd's bubble call could prove to be wrong. Many doubted the early days of the last bull market, too. ""One thing about bubbles is they tend to go on longer and go further than people ever expect,"" he said. ""Timing it is extremely difficult."" Yet he's not the only sophisticated investor warning that the worst may not be over. Fifty-three percent of global fund managers say this is a ""bear market rally,"" not the beginning of a new bull market, according to a survey released by Bank of America on Tuesday. And even more, 78%, say the stock market is overvalued. That's the highest since the survey began asking the question in 1998. Even the Fed is warning that the V-shaped recovery, which the stock market is betting on, may not happen. ""Until the public is confident that the disease is contained, a full recovery is unlikely,"" Powell said during testimony on Tuesday. Minerd said it could be ""at least a good three- to four-year slog"" before employment and GDP return to pre-coronavirus levels. Some jobs impacted by shifts in consumer behavior are ""never coming back,"" he said, potentially causing ""permanently"" elevated unemployment.

That may not matter,Tesla announced late Monday that its new Model S Long Range Plus sedan became the first electric car to be certified by the EPA to drive more than 400 miles on a single charge.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:30:20 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/yallMeMpKrE/index.html,"Tesla announced late Monday that its new Model S Long Range Plus sedan became the first electric car to be certified by the EPA to drive more than 400 miles on a single charge. But that milestone may not actually mean that much to consumers. A number of electric vehicles already on the market get more than 200 miles of range, which many experts feel is enough to give car shoppers sufficient comfort. ""For an EV, anything over 200 miles is going to be more than enough for almost everybody,"" said Sam Abuelsamid, an EV industry analyst with the consulting firm Guidehouse Insights. And for those car shoppers that still aren't comfortable, even with a driving range of more than 200 miles, the jump to 400 isn't going to help, said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with Edmunds.com. ""That difference between 100 to 200 is great, but 300 to 400 maybe is less impactful,"" she said. More (and better) chargers For those customers who are still hesitant, their issue isn't really range anymore, she said. It's charging infrastructure. The average American drives less than 40 miles on a typical day and those with electric vehicles can charge their EVs at home. People want long range for when they take road trips. For that, more and better chargers will make the big difference, she said, not another 50 miles of range. ""[The chargers] have to be working, not broken"" she said, ""And not like the line is super long line to get to."" More chargers are being installed. The number of publicly accessible chargers increased 60% around the world between 2018 and 2019, according to the International Energy Agency. The bulk of that growth was in China, however. Is it worth the cost? In terms of price, the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus is in the upper echelons, even among luxury vehicles. The base price of the Tesla Model S Long Range Plus is around $75,000, roughly the same as the Long Range model it replaces, which had an EPA-rated 373 miles of range. It's difficult to get a sense of how much money that translates to in terms of dollars-per-mile since the only other version of the Model S currently offered on Tesla's web site in the US is the Model S Performance, which costs almost $90,000. The Model S Performance can go just 348 miles on a charge, but buyers are presumably paying for the car's 2.3 second zero-to-60 time and better handling. (The Long Range Plus goes from zero to 60 in a comparatively leisurely 3.7 seconds.) More long-range EVs on the way Another thing to consider is that Tesla won't be the only auto maker that will offer electric vehicles that can go hundreds of miles on a chrarge. For its part, GM (GM) has said that, it too, will have vehicles with more than 400 miles of range in the next few years thanks to new battery technologies. Volkswagen has also said it will offer a vehicle with more than 400 miles, but that estimate is based in European driving tests and, so, would not necessarily be applicable to the US market. EPA estimates, mind you, are just estimates. Driving ranges for EVs are measured using the same tests the EPA dictates for gasoline-powered vehicles. These are designed to mimic actual usage but they are highly standardized laboratory tests which means that, as the expression goes, ""Your mileage may vary."" With an EPA estimate of 402 miles, Tesla Model S Long Range Plus drivers should be able to easily exceed 300 miles of range in their daily driving, though, said Abuelsamid. In testing by Consumer Reports, Tesla vehicles did come close to the EPA range estimates, said Jake Fisher, the group's head of auto testing. And, he said, every little bit helps. ""It's one of these things like you could never be too wealthy or too thin, right?"" said Fisher. ""You can never have too much range on an electric car."" "
92,Telling the truth makes a huge difference,"Like many parents, I suspect, I've been anxiously awaiting news from my twin sons' schools about plans for the fall in these most uncertain of times.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:29:29 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/G6Szga0XvSc/index.html,"Vicky Ward is a senior reporter at CNN. She is the former executive editor of Talk Magazine, a former contributing editor to Vanity Fair and author of ""The Devil's Casino,"" ""The Liar's Ball"" and ""Kushner, Inc."" The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. Like many parents, I suspect, I've been anxiously awaiting news from my twin sons' schools about plans for the fall in these most uncertain of times. Last week, one of them, The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, invited all parents to a webinar where they laid out their plans for a reopening and took questions in real time. The session, which lasted an hour, was one of the most uplifting experiences I've had since the pandemic began. The headmaster, Steven Murray, and his fellow faculty members inspired hope -- not just because they are opening the private boarding school  -- and certainly not because they promised a Covid-free environment for the students. In fact Murray was clear that the school was unlikely to be Covid-free and that the community's mind-set would have to change: ""zero risk tolerance is not realistic; coming to school will not be 100% risk free any more than driving a car is risk free,""  he said. What was truly inspiring was the immense effort, thought, integrity -- and above all humility-- that went into his presentation. Of course, the school has resources that many public schools and other private schools may not have, but Murray has certainly put them to good use in this crisis. He and the faculty task force have been on a steep learning curve and already made extraordinary infrastructure innovations and program alterations that include: pre-arrival protocols, testing, tracking technology, tracing, mask-wearing, social-distancing, isolation, an expanded health center, PPE, hepa filters, new air filters, touchless toilets, sinks and showers, plexiglass shields, individual cleaning bags for students, longer lunches to avoid crowding, quarantine facilities,  smaller classrooms and staggered arrivals. But Murray did not promise perfection. Rather, he showed vulnerability, promising to loop parents in on his deep-dive discovery about how best to keep the kids as safe as possible in ""the new normal."" ""I never knew I'd be studying viral load in a breath or a cough versus viral load left on a doorknob ... or using terms like de-densifying social spaces ... but here we are,"" he began. And, for me, the most striking part, perhaps was when he likened the many impressive safeguards being put in place to ... cheese. ""Most of the protocols are imperfect, but taken together, it's a little bit like Swiss cheese, each slice has holes, but layered together the holes begin to be covered and so together a series of overlapping protocols can make us safer."" Swiss cheese has never seemed so comforting. And how ironic  that Murray should use that imagery just three days before the President used another dairy product, in a horrific simile when describing how the National Guard cleared protesters in Minneapolis ""like a knife cutting butter."" Listening to Murray, I felt hopeful for the first time in days (as did my son when I gave him the highlights). Yes, it's possible that my son and other students will get sick he goes back to school  -- but I take great comfort, as does he, in the fact that he is in the best possible hands, a faculty who are learning and reaching out, unafraid to say what they don't know to both students and parents, as they go. Also comforting was a study published Tuesday that people under 20 are about half as likely to get infected by the virus than their elders. Murray's presentation was a welcome reminder of what real leadership can and should look like in these uncertain times, when there is a vacuum at the top of our country. Our President continually talks about himself and his management of the pandemic in hyperbolically optimistic -- one might easily argue mendacious --  language. He has claimed success in confronting the virus, giving credit to just one person: himself. Whereas Murray was careful to lay great emphasis on how success for the school could only come from a shared responsibility in the community. ""My actions affect others,"" Murray said and he talked of new behaviors to be learned, and internalized and how the example comes from the top. As he said this, the contrasting image of the President's unmasked face, came to mind, along with imaginings of what the unmasked rallies slated to begin this weekend will look like and what sickness they will spread. In considering how to open safely, Murray said he has consulted with the CDC, state officials, local hospitals, pediatricians, New England high schools and universities, business leaders including the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and the PGA, the owner of an NBA franchise, Pennsylvania University Medical school, state and federal officials and hired an consulting firm that specializes in epidemiology and environmental hazards in hospitals. At Lawrenceville, unlike the Trump White House, they are NOT taking the view that they know better than the scientists and other experts. Murray is not running for re-election in November, but in some ways the stakes for him are just as high as they are for the President. If his school doesn't open, come September, the outcome could be disastrous, given that his business model is heavily dependent on tuition fees. So, since he cannot promise a Covid-free environment, he is offering something that is, I'd argue, just as valuable, maybe more: trust. His webinar showed that even in the midst of the crisis -- or crises in which our country is immersed -- trust is winnable. From where I sit, Swiss cheese is a great deal more reassuring than sliced butter. "

Last week, novelist, director and television writer John Ridley -- an Academy Award winner for his screenplay for the movie ""12 Years a Slave"" --  wrote a brief but compelling op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, asking HBO (a sister company of CNN under the ownership of WarnerMedia) to take the movie ""Gone With the Wind"" off of its much-hyped new streaming platform HBO Max. Ridley wrote that the movie ""glorifies the antebellum south. It is a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.""  In Ridley's estimation, the film ""continues to give cover to those who falsely claim that clinging to the iconography of the plantation era is a matter of 'heritage, not hate.'"" Just a day after Ridley's op-ed ran, HBO temporarily pulled the film from streaming. There's a deeper conversation to be had about how ""Gone With the Wind""'s racist depictions and white-supremacy-indulgent view of our nation's past should be addressed today, which University of Chicago professor and Turner Classic Movies co-host Jacqueline Stewart goes into here. But in an era where we're finally challenging some of our society's most deeply anchored (and frankly, cherished) pillars of oppression, we should also consider the broader question raised by Ridley's op-ed and other recent articles: What should we do with cultural artifacts that reflect grotesque and shameful aspects of our history? ""Gone With the Wind"" is hardly the only movie that celebrates America's era of slavery. It's not even the only such film that's considered a ""classic"" -- D.W. Griffith's explicitly racist work of Ku Klux Klan propaganda, ""The Birth of a Nation,"" appeared alongside ""Gone With the Wind"" on the American Film Institute's 100th anniversary list of the ""100 greatest movies,"" as picked by a jury of 1,500 film creators, critics and academics. That list also included ""The Jazz Singer,"" the 1927 drama that made a superstar out of a blackface-wearing Al Jolson, and Disney's 1940 animated epic ""Fantasia,"" whose original ""Pastoral Symphony"" sequence features a sharply offensive depiction of a little black centaur with stereotypical features and a screen role that can generously be described as servile. Also on the list of classics: films that present retrograde depictions of trans people (""Tootsie,"" ""Silence of the Lambs"") and the disabled (""Psycho,"" ""Forrest Gump""); the 1961 adaptation of the musical ""West Side Story,"" with its abundant Puerto Rican caricatures and a very white Natalie Wood in the Latinx role of Maria; and ""Annie Hall,"" directed by the multiply problematic Woody Allen. The fact is, our past is full of problematic faves, which we've chosen to address in wildly uneven fashion. ""The Birth of a Nation"" isn't on any major streaming platform, but it's available on Sling, Dish Network's streaming subsidiary, and on the library platform Kanopy, which calls it ""profoundly influential and controversial."" ""The Jazz Singer"" can be rented on Amazon Prime, among many other platforms -- all of which describe it as a seminal film and reference its groundbreaking Jewish themes, without mentioning its blackface content or explaining the damaging history of blackface minstrelsy. Disney digitally removed its stereotypical centaur from all releases of ""Fantasia"" after its original run, and has stamped warnings about ""outdated cultural depictions"" on other films, like the 1941 animated feature ""Dumbo"" (which contains a bird whose actual character name is ""Jim Crow""), 1953's ""Peter Pan"" (which features extreme caricatures of Native Americans) and pretty much every animated depiction of a Siamese cat in the company's history (caricatured orientalist renderings and ching-chong antics). And Disney has essentially indicated it will never rerelease what some call its ""most notorious movie,"" ""Song of the South,"" a live-action/animated pastiche that features Amos 'n' Andy castmember James Baskett as ""Uncle Remus"" telling black folktales to the grandkids of a white plantation owner. Baskett  --  who was not invited to the premiere due to segregation -- was later awarded an honorary Oscar for his performance, making him the first black male actor to receive an Academy Award. And because the film also starred a live-action Hattie McDaniel, it's also the first film to have featured two Oscar-winning black actors on screen at the same time. The fact that this milestone in African American history is now essentially unavailable for viewing (although the movie still serves as the storybook theme for Disney's popular Splash Mountain amusement park attractions) highlights one concern with simply pulling movies out of circulation -- doing so leads to both disposal of evidence of oppression and erasure of milestones of resistance. But there are equally significant issues with editing out repugnant content or with simply stamping them with warnings.. So what approach makes the most sense given our desire to evolve beyond our problematic past without, presumably, denying it? I've found myself in the thick of this debate before, most notably in the context of rereleases and showcases of the much-beloved 1961 Audrey Hepburn film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (which was one of several hundred movies nominated for, but not selected as, one of AFI's top 100). Anyone who's seen the film knows that, embedded amid its agile, comic-romantic patter and lyrically optimistic view of New York, is one of the most egregious yellowface performances in cinematic history: Mickey Rooney's slant-eyed, bucktoothed, living anti-Asian propaganda poster I.Y. Yunioshi. In 2011, when I was still in New York and the Brooklyn Bridge Park Conservatory decided to show the film as part of its publicly funded free screening series, my longtime friend Ursula Liang, a veteran documentarian and journalist, organized a boycott of the series in response. I disagreed with the boycott then, because my instincts favor the encouragement of contextualization and counter-speech, rather than attempts to erase or suppress ugly history. Unlike statues and monuments, which are merely glorified gravestones, popular culture is a living entity, constantly being commented on and referenced. We can't go back in time and alter the circumstances that led to the creation of abhorrent works, repellent narratives and distorted images. As a result, removing them from view actually makes it harder to contend with them. It allows creators, companies and audiences to comfortably pretend they never existed, and to move frictionlessly onward without engaging in real structural change in the present. ""Literally the easiest thing to do [with repulsive content] is to remove it -- it's not an act of courage, solidarity or progress to do so,"" Rebecca Carroll, author of ""Uncle Tom or New Negro?"" and ""Saving the Race,"" and host of WNYC's race and culture podcast ""Come Through,"" told me. She likened it to the black square posted on social media by would-be Black Lives Matter allies. ""It's what you do when you don't have the right words, to buy time hoping things will blow over. But it shouldn't be so easy; it should be really hard and super uncomfortable. Struggle with your answer. I'm here. I'll wait."" To John Ridley's credit, his op-ed didn't ask for permanent removal of ""Gone With the Wind"" from HBO Max, but rather for it to be pulled back until it could be framed with appropriate statements and framing. The question is whether a simple ""trigger warning,"" readily skipped or ignored, does much to ""contextualize"" the film -- not to mention why such words weren't already available and in place, given that HBO and CNN sister channel TCM (also owned by WarnerMedia) had addressed the film's problematic aspects last year, during its 80th anniversary. ""It doesn't solve the white supremacy that made it to begin with,"" Franklin Leonard, founder of screenplay discovery platform The Black List, told me in an interview. ""It does not go back in time and rightfully put Hattie McDaniel at the Oscars ceremony, which she was not allowed to attend when she won [due to segregation]. It doesn't change that Hollywood thinks of black-led and directed movies as having less value, especially abroad, even when data says otherwise. All it does is paper over these failures. If you really want to put ""Gone With the Wind"" in context, do it by addressing Hollywood's historic lack of black stories told by black people."" Leonard noted as well that an as-yet-unproduced script about the making of ""Gone With the Wind,"" told from the point of view of McDaniel, exists -- the widely celebrated ""Selznick's Folly,"" written by Gesha-Marie Bland. He asked: ""What better way is there to understand 'Gone With the Wind' than to make that movie, from the perspective of the black actor who won an Academy Award for her performance?"" Yes, making movies takes time. But Bland's script first surfaced in 2017. And ""Gone With the Wind"" has been around for 81 years. As Carroll put it to me, ""We've known this was a problem for eight decades, that there were profoundly offensive things about this movie, not to mention the racist society and culture and institutions around it."" The question she asked, however rhetorical, says it all: ""This was not a pop quiz, America. We had time to study. How could we be scrambling now to put things in place?"" "
94,Trump isn't aging well,Donald Trump is not coping well.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:59:58 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nHphi1_V9c4/index.html,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author with Peter Eisner of ""The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Donald Trump is not coping well. As he turned 74 last weekend, the oldest man ever to assume the presidency got all defensive about how he looked walking down a ramp at West Point. In truth, his slow-mo shuffle didn't reveal anything that should embarrass a senior citizen. What was truly troubling was what Trump revealed the next day, when he shouted on Twitter: ""THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!"" The tweet harked back to Richard Nixon, who was president when the term ""silent majority"" was first used in 1969. It revealed how even in these troubled times, with the pandemic death toll passing 115,000 and citizens crying out for an end to police violence against minorities, the President is stuck in the past, out of step with a country that has changed practically overnight. Some of the change is evident in the streets, where citizens of every race, religion, ethnicity and age group have joined a nationwide protest movement that recognizes police violence against African Americans and insists that Black Lives Matter. More proof of a changed society can be found in a recent Gallup poll that found four-in-10 support some aspects of socialism. Trump even seems to be losing the support of high-ranking military leaders as he refuses to consider renaming bases named for Confederate officers who waged war against the United States. Trump is so incapable of adapting to change that he's been lapped by NASCAR: It recently banned the Confederate flag, which has long been waved by fans at its tracks. Even the National Football League, which engaged in a long row with players who knelt to protest racial injustice as the National Anthem was played, has reversed field. Locked in his increasingly isolated social and political views, Trump sticks to his old tricks, like calling on the ""silent majority"" because he's apparently incapable of seeing modern America. For those who don't remember, or never learned about the term's origin, the ""silent majority"" was first invoked by President Nixon to argue that most Americans supported the war in Vietnam. In fact, polls done at the time showed that most believed the country's involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake. Similarly wrong was Nixon's claim that his ""majority"" was silent. Pro-war Americans argued their side of things in political debates and kitchen-table discussions. They paraded and rallied, and a few would join in an organized attack -- the Hard Hat Riot of 1970 -- on anti-war activists. If the phrase ""silent majority"" was so inaccurate, what about it would appeal to Trump? Well, it's not that he was all for America's war effort. As Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan he ""was never a fan"" of the war. It's more likely that, as a marketing expert, the reality TV host who made ""You're fired!"" his catch phrase loves the way that Nixon's two-word term communicated so much to his political base. Nixon's silent majority was, everyone knew, middle class, middle-aged, Christian, white and conservative, and they supported him. As Trump leans on the term he reveals himself to be not only nostalgic, which is always a hazard for the aging, but a victim of another common problem among older folks: inflexibility. To be clear, this problem can afflict people of all ages, and it's also true that many seniors possess nimble minds. However, Trump has long shown he is rigidly attached to a bygone era, and has demonstrated an inability to recognize change and adapt to it. Take, for example, the political injury he suffered when he scheduled a rally for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. As much of America knows, the date marks the annual Juneteenth celebration of African Americans' emancipation. (The name derives from the day when Union forces notified slaves in Texas that they were free.) Long recognized in black communities, the celebration of Juneteenth has gained popularity in most corners of the nation. Last year the Republican National Committee marked the day with a proclamation. Trump's Senate ally Tim Scott has said the President didn't understand the significance of Juneteenth (he changed the date of the rally when people pointed it out). This is a sign of a man living in an isolated past. So, too, is Trump's selection of Tulsa for his campaign rally. Tulsa is the site of what has been called the worst racial massacre in US history. White mobs burned more than 1,000 black homes and businesses. Deaths were estimated at between 100 and 300. For Trump to pick Tulsa, especially when the country is in the middle of coast-to-coast protests over police violence against black Americans, reflects either a colossal lack of awareness or monstrous cruelty. The way Trump acts and speaks often makes him look like a mean old man. Take his administration's decision to change the rules so health insurance companies can discriminate against transgender people. Many larger insurers opposed the change, which was announced on Saturday. Two days later, the Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender people. This Supreme Court is never on the leading edge of radical change, but even the justices seated on this court -- six of whom qualify for Medicare -- showed they understand America in a way that the president does not. Our President's inflexible mind is on display every time he calls out for ""law and order"" in response to civil rights protests that are overwhelmingly peaceful and supported by great majorities of Americans. (Perhaps Trump's mind is stuck in the 60s.) He did himself a similar disservice when during a recent press conference where he was questioned by female reporters he appeared to muse nostalgically about the days when women were meek and retiring. Again, we must all recognize that Trump's rigidity says nothing about all older people. (Follow the 84-year-old Dalai Lama on Twitter and you'll see what I mean.) However, in the President's case the inability to adapt does seem to be the sign of a man who is not aging well. He appears even more defensive and reactionary than he was when he was elected. And like an out-of-touch founder of a business he's no longer capable of running, he could do a whole lot of damage on his way out the door.  "
95,Remarkable idiocy of Trump rally in Tulsa,"Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery. And then I was startled that he backed down and delayed the rally by a day. I will let others examine Trump's cruelty in stoking racial divisiveness at such a historical flashpoint. Let others comment on his flippant disregard of public health experts as he ridicules mask wearers as unmanly of PC for caring about keeping themselves and others safe from Covid-19. Instead, I will focus on the remarkable idiocy of staging a large indoor public gathering in Tulsa just now. Tulsa may not be the single worst place in the US to have a mask-free and liability-free rally, though the just identified Whirlpool plant outbreak there may place it in the running. Indeed, cases are going up sharply in Tulsa County (from 7-day rolling average of 13.6 cases to 53.37 cases for most recent two weeks) signaling substantial community transmission. The disease appears disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics who constitute 13% of the population but 27% of the Covid-19 cases. Furthermore, Tulsa is near the border of several states; Trump's rally is likely to draw from these areas as well. Over in Arkansas, four counties at the Oklahoma border -- Benton, Washington (home of Fayetteville), Crawford, and Sebastian (home of Fort Smith) -- have experienced sharply increasing case rates in the last two weeks. This is likely due to the concentration of meatpacking plants in the area, Nationally, these areas have been connected to Covid-19 transmission due to the tight quarters in processing lines and other areas in busy plants. Tyson Foods, the second largest meatpacking company in the US, is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, which straddles Benton and Washington Counties. It is a mere 100 miles from Tulsa. Tulsa also is a few hours down the road from the southwest corner of Missouri. Jasper (home of Joplin), McDonald and Newton Counties each have gone from almost no cases two weeks ago to more than five cases daily per county -- in Jasper's case, nearly 10 (again, rolling 7-day average). This has led local authorities to reinstitute some precautions. The source of the increase is not known, though adjacent Barry County features a chicken meatpacking plant that has seen its first two cases. As we have witnessed repeatedly, today's two cases may presage tomorrow's frantic headline. So, from a strict public health perspective, the selection of Tulsa is a terrible decision. So why the choice? Yes, Tulsa is an extremely conservative city with wonderful cheeseburgers and a deluxe golf course, as well as a city where he has found enthusiastic support at past rallies, but this is true of many cities in the South. Is the choice really just another manifestation of Brutalist politics? As a native Oklahoman, I have a theory: Oral Roberts. Oral Roberts and the hazy world of faith healing. I know this topic quite well. As a kid, on Sunday mornings, my brothers and I used to watch Oral Roberts on television. Our Hebrew Sunday School started at 10 a.m., so we killed time in the early hours watching the faith healing shows till it was time to go listen to the rabbi. Importantly, this was before Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and the other preachers with high production values crowded out the field. The Oral Roberts shows then were grainy and uncertain with a jittery camera and fluctuating sound that made them strangely sincere. Watching, my brothers and I felt confusion and awe, wondering if they were kidding or if they were actors or if they were insane or if they maybe were being cured -- I mean it seemed so convincing in its own way. Rows of people looking up, believing and eager and happy despite (or because of) the scene's basic lack of credibility. They shrieked and clapped as Oral Roberts' touch and prayer healed person after person. Which brings us to now and the Trump rallies. For me, the most unsettling feature as he gloats and preens his hour upon the stage is the hypnotic connection between him and his crowd. Because these are the very faces I saw on my Sunday morning TV -- those of people who are witnessing an incredible miracle. Tulsa therefore is the perfect place for the President to resume his campaign. Not only does he get a groveling crowd and a chance to cruelly wink at the city's racist past but because he is guaranteed something he can't find any place else: an arena full of people raised on the exhilarating lunacy of a giant tent revival.

The looming threat of a shortage of personal protective equipment and other supplies for health care workers in the face of a surge in cases made this the right call under the circumstances.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:26:58 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/XglSzecVA84/index.html,"Seema Verma is the administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion articles at CNN. Near the outset of the grueling war against Covid-19,  President Donald Trump directed my agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), to recommend the postponement of non-emergency elective surgeries and procedures. The looming threat of a shortage of personal protective equipment and other supplies for health care workers in the face of a surge in cases made this the right call under the circumstances. Thankfully, providers around the country -- willing to make a financial sacrifice for the good of their country -- heeded that call. At the same time, it also meant patients might have to forgo necessary care until the situation stabilized. Fortunately, President Trump's dramatic expansion of payments for Medicare telehealth  has successfully blunted some of the impact. It allowed patients to access their clinicians while staying safe at home. This virtual care has been especially important for beneficiaries most vulnerable to the virus and healthcare workers who were spared unnecessary exposure to it. When it comes to telehealth, it took a crisis to push our country to a new frontier. That being said, telehealth can never replace what was and remains the gold standard: in-person care. Physicians will always need to listen to their patients' heart and lungs; children will always need their vaccinations; and adults cannot go too long without cancer screenings. Indeed, the American Academy of Pediatrics, in a recent call with CMS, painted a haunting picture of refrigerator upon refrigerator of unused children's vaccines in pediatric offices around the country after a 60-80% drop in childhood vaccinations. If we fail to resume the vaccination of our children, we run the risk of a resurgence -- but this time, of long-vanquished conditions such as measles or mumps. While we continue to grapple with the virus, the sacrifices of the American people and heroic health care workers on the frontlines have brought us a long way from where we were two months ago. Telehealth will remain an important tool, but some areas of the country should also begin resuming in-person care for those who need operations, procedures, preventive care, or evaluation for chronic conditions. The Trump administration has always understood that the public health and Americans' economic health have a reciprocal relationship to one another. Just as public health is the first prerequisite for economic health, unnecessary economic contraction can inflict a devastating public health toll as people put off important procedures or preventative care -- and physician practices fold. More than half of primary-care practices have sustained a greater than 50% reduction in their patients, according to nonprofit Primary Care Collaborative.  The Trump administration worked with Congress to obtain a historically unprecedented $175 billion in relief for hospitals and other providers. Nevertheless, even large health care systems have furloughed tens of thousands of staff. For the financial survival of a large portion of our nation's health care system -- and the critical medical care they provide -- we must gradually reopen. CMS has put out detailed recommendations to help states and localities to do exactly that. These recommendations -- which last week entered Phase 2 -- are a part of the President's guidelines on reopening, which contain a number of thresholds -- regarding case numbers, surge capacity and testing -- that should be met before moving on to any of the three phases. Once they are met, clinicians and healthcare facilities should partner with their local and state health officials to determine a path forward based on CMS' recommendations. As part of Phase 2 of the President's plan, they should begin to resume in-person care as long as it will not jeopardize their surge capacity. Specified non-Covid-19 care sites will be critical so patients know it is safe to get the care they need. Face masks, physical distancing, limitation of visitors and careful screening of all patients and staff members remain essential. Whenever possible, testing should be conducted before a patient comes in for a scheduled procedure. Americans need their health care. We have seen a dramatic drop in cancer screenings; we know from our internal data that the number of cataract surgeries performed during the pandemic has decreased; and we are concerned about those not seeking care for chest pain, new lumps and myriad other symptoms. Our Phase 2 recommendations include specific information and recommendations for patients seeking to receive treatment safely. I want to reassure Americans that their doctors, hospitals, and health systems are taking great care to keep them safe when they venture out to get the care they need. All across this nation, we are seeing pharmacies, physician offices and hospitals making use of newly expanded testing capacity to carefully test patients  and staff for Covid-19 when clinically necessary, preparing for any outbreaks, and working to secure a reliable means of obtaining the supplies they need. Parents should feel safe bringing their children to see their pediatricians.  Adults should seek evaluation of nagging symptoms that don't go away. The American health care system and the general public made heroic sacrifices to meet the generational challenge posed by Covid-19. That challenge continues, but for many areas of the country in a different way. It is time for health care in the US to safely but steadily resume. "
97,Stay safe this summer. Here's how,"Every day we are bombarded with new numbers -- 20,000 new infections and 800-1,000 new deaths every day; projections such as the total US death toll reaching 130,000 by July 4.","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:25:00 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/KouEVhllYFw/index.html,"This is the first in a series of regular columns on making choices in the era of Covid-19 by Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. His research focuses on the evolution of the immune system and how animals defend themselves from infection. Follow him on Twitter @ErinBromage. The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Every day we are bombarded with new numbers -- 20,000 new infections and 800-1,000 new deaths every day; projections such as the total US death toll reaching 130,000 by July 4. Our responses to hearing these numbers seem to vary widely -- some of us lock ourselves away in our homes, while others tell ourselves the threat of infection is over. Rather than running to one of these extremes, it would be better for people to understand the risk and to make choices based on information. But with so much news and data hitting us from so many  different sources, how do we make good choices for ourselves and our families? Most people would look at the number of new cases per day and think this would be a good metric, but it's not. Cases per day can be manipulated by the number of tests processed per day. When states test more often, they find more infected people. And testing more every day is a good thing. Why testing matters Every person who tests positive to the virus can be subsequently isolated, which breaks a transmission chain. You want to see your state testing more, so let's not crucify states that are increasing their testing when they report the inevitable result of an increase in confirmed cases -- especially because the alternative is far worse. If your state tests fewer people, then the true dynamics of what is going on will be hidden. The key numbers to watch are how many of the daily tests come back positive, as well as the weekly trend. Are the weekly numbers rising, staying flat, or falling? In a state where anyone can be tested, we want fewer than 2% of all tests to be positive. In states where they are selectively testing and testing hotspots, then we want the number to be below 5%. In both cases, the lower the number the better the state is doing at responding to the pandemic; a decline in the percentage of positive tests also is a good sign. Nationally, the percentage of tests that come back positive is about 4.5% and flat, but this number varies greatly depending on the state and county. Currently, 16 states and Puerto Rico are above 5% of testing positivity and in many of those states the trend in percentage of positive tests is going up. One of the most concerning states is Texas. Daily cases are increasing, testing is flat, and the number of positive tests is high (9.7%) and increasing. This may signify that they are testing largely in hotspots, but the overall trend is not good. In contrast, the early hard-hit states like New York, Massachusetts, and Michigan are all doing well and improving. We know this because the percentage of tests that come back positive and the daily number of new infections is falling. You can check how your state is doing here. The truth about herd immunity One of the questions I am often asked is about herd immunity Many of you may have heard that the pandemic will be over when we achieve herd immunity. For herd immunity to protect us, however, we need to get between 60% to 80% of the US population immune to this virus. If we reach 80% of the population being immune, the virus would have a very hard time finding a new susceptible host to infect. But immunity can only occur by natural infection or vaccination, and there is no guarantee that immunity from natural infection will be long-lasting. Only time will tell. Even in the hardest-hit states, such as New York, only 20% of the residents of New York City have been exposed and successfully fought off the infection, compared to only 2.6% of the people in the Finger Lakes region of the state. This means that the city would need another two to three outbreaks, similar in magnitude to the one in April, to achieve herd immunity through natural exposure. The rest of the state would need years to get to this same goal. Epidemiologists believe that only 2-5% of the US population nationally has been exposed to the virus and recovered, and infections have not been distributed evenly throughout the population. This puts us a long way from beating this virus through natural exposure and the prospect of a successful vaccine remains uncertain. Therefore, we must find a way to live with this virus without sacrificing 1% of our population or going back to the strict restrictions of March and April. However, a second wave of high infection rates and similar mortality rates is avoidable. What does this mean for your summer? Our choices over the coming months will determine the trajectory of this pandemic. If we continue to pursue activities that pose a high risk for infection, such as large indoor gatherings, then we will hear the roar of that second wave sooner than later. If we take a more measured approach, by improving hand hygiene, limiting daily interactions with other people, maintaining physical distance and increasing face mask use when we can't maintain the distance, then businesses can operate safely, people can return to work and the activities our children are missing can resume. Our goals must be to lower the risks of infection and reduce harm. Ultimately, we must all get used to continually tuning our behavior based on local, county and statewide trends in the data. If I were living in the beautiful state of Montana, where there is only a handful of new cases per day, where they are testing well, and only 0.4% of their tests are positive and that trend is decreasing, I would feel much more comfortable eating inside a restaurant and socializing indoor with friends. On the other hand, if I was living in a county where the test-to-positive ratio was at 10%, limiting daily interactions, physical distancing and mask use would become critical to lower the risk of infection. Even at Montana's envious numbers (0.4%), a gathering of 250 people would mean that at least one of those people in attendance would be infected and could infect others. And in another state, the thought of putting 19,000 people into an indoor venue for a rally, when the infection rates are already much higher than Montana, certainly has my attention. Despite the threat of infection, there are many things I am looking forward to this summer: my first meal at a restaurant (dining outdoors), visiting with more than one or two households at a time, and spending time at the beach. These interactions will be a little different than last summer. We will have to keep personal risks and risk mitigation measures in mind, but these adjustments are well worth the payoff of getting to enjoy some of my family's usual summertime activities. We all have a responsibility to reduce harm, not just to ourselves, but also to the greater community. Our actions, and the choices we make over the coming weeks and months, will dictate what comes next and, dare I suggest, even decide whether and when we have a second wave. "
98,Hundreds of Beijing flights canceled after coronavirus resurgence,"Hundreds of flights in and out of Beijing were canceled on Wednesday as authorities stepped up measures to rein in a sudden outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese capital, placing it under a so-called ""soft lockdown"".","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 10:33:21 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/rjbQTnX5rX8/index.html,"Hundreds of flights in and out of Beijing were canceled on Wednesday as authorities stepped up measures to rein in a sudden outbreak of coronavirus in the Chinese capital, placing it under a so-called ""soft lockdown"". On Wednesday, Beijing reported 31 new Covid-19 cases for the previous day, bringing the total number of infections over the past six days to 137. The flare-up, linked to the city's largest wholesale food market, Xinfadi, is the worst coronavirus resurgence in China since the initial epidemic was largely brought under control in March. The latest outbreak has already spread to nine of Beijing's 16 districts and four other provinces, not only in neighboring Hebei, but also Liaoning in the northeast, Sichuan in the southwest and Zhejiang on the country's eastern coast. To curb the virus from further spreading in the country, authorities banned all residents living in neighbourhoods deemed medium or high risk from leaving Beijing, as well as people connected to the Xinfadi market. So far, the city has 27 areas designated as medium-risk and another area -- close to Xinfadi -- marked as high-risk. Other residents in the city of 20 million are urged not to make non-essential journeys away from the capital, but those who insist on leaving must produce a negative coronavirus test result obtained within a week, according to the municipal government announcement. A growing number of cities and provinces, including Shanghai, have said they will impose restrictions such as mandatory quarantine on people arriving from Beijing, especially those from medium or high risk neighbourhoods. Mass flight cancellations While the Beijing government did not announce the suspension of transportation in and out of the city, hundreds of flights were canceled at Beijing's two major airports on Wednesday, according to aviation data providers. There was no official announcement from the Chinese government on the flight cancellations. CNN has reached out to Air China, China Eastern Airlines and China Southern Airlines for comment but has not received any response. According to aviation data tracker Variflight, as of 3 p.m. local time Wednesday (3 a.m. ET), at least 630 flights had been or were likely to be canceled at the Beijing Capital International Airport and Beijing Daxing International Airport -- around half of all scheduled flights. Air traffic at from both airports had been on the rise since May until the drastic plunge this week, Variflight data showed. Flight Master, another China-based aviation data provider, said 1,255 flights had been scrapped at both airports on Wednesday, accounting for 67% of outgoing flights and 68% of incoming flights. Air China, the country's flag carrier, announced on social media that 297 flights arriving or departing from the Beijing Capital International Airport were canceled. ""Affected by the outbreak in Beijing, there are mass delays and cancellations of arriving and departing flights,"" its statement said, without specifying if the authorities had given any orders for the cancellations. Several domestic airlines, including Air China, China Eastern, China Southern and Hainan Airlines, have promised full refunds to passengers who bought tickets to leave Beijing from this week to the end of June, according to the state-run People's Daily newspaper. The country's railway authorities also announced full refunds on all tickets to and from Beijing booked before Wednesday, People's Daily reported. Earlier this week, the city had already suspended all outbound taxi and car-hailing services, and some long-distance bus routes between Beijing and neighboring provinces. Raised alert Describing the new outbreak as ""very severe,"" the Beijing municipal government on Tuesday night raised its alert level to Level 2 -- the second-highest in a four-tier public health emergency response system, ramping up restrictive measures across the city. All kindergartens, primary schools and secondary schools were shut, and students were told to return to online studying -- a prevalent practice across China from February to April, when most schools were closed due to the initial coronavirus outbreak. On Wednesday, Beijing officials told a news conference that the city's university entrance exams will go ahead as scheduled on July 7. Students are required to stay at home for two weeks before sitting the exams, officials said. Companies and factories are allowed to remain open, but employees are encouraged to work from home, according to the government announcement. The city is also reintroducing strict access rules in and out of all residential communities, requiring visitors to register and have their temperatures checked. This comes after 29 residential communities around Xinfadi and two other food markets in the city were placed under strict lockdowns, after coronavirus cases were confirmed at the markets.

99,A Mississippi city took down the state flag because of the Confederate battle flag,"The city of Gulfport, Mississippi, is removing the state flag at all city-owned buildings and facilities because it includes the Confederate battle flag.","Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:46:40 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/p9Yum40UUBs/index.html,"The city of Gulfport, Mississippi, is removing the state flag at all city-owned buildings and facilities because it includes the Confederate battle flag. The city council unanimously passed a resolution on Tuesday urging the Mississippi Legislature to ""respectfully retire"" the flag that has flown over the state since 1894. The resolution acknowledged that the flag -- with its 13 white stars on a blue X with a red background -- means different things to different people, but said for many it is ""a painful reminder of past days of transgressions in this State and has also been used by some as an image of hatred, divisiveness, and violence."" It said the flag does not represent the ideals and principles of the state or the city. Gulfport is the second-largest city in Mississippi, with a population estimated at 71,705, according to the US Census Bureau. Gulfport Mayor Billy Hewes' office posted video of the flag being taken down at City Hall on its Facebook page. It was replaced with the Magnolia flag, which was adopted as Mississippi's first official flag in 1861 when the state seceded from the United States to join the Confederacy. Mississippi is the only state that still includes the symbol in its flag. A bipartisan group of state lawmakers is discussing changing the flag and cities around the United States are wrestling with how to deal with Confederate statues and other symbols. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves told reporters last week that he wouldn't support changing the flag unless the people of Mississippi voted for it. In 2001, 65% of Mississippi residents voted to keep the flag. Wallace Mason, the only Gulfport resident to speak in favor of keeping the flag at Tuesday's meeting, told the council that the city shouldn't overturn the will of the people. ""It's like spitting in the face of the voters who won,"" he said. ""I'm against racism, but I'm also for this flag and it doesn't stand for racism."" Most of the residents who spoke argued that the flag symbolized racism, segregation, lynchings and other violence against black people. ""If there's nothing wrong with the flag, why is it every time a racist act, an aggressive act is done, that flag is there?"" asked John Davis. He said the flag was an insult to anyone who is not white. Councilwoman Ella Holmes-Hines, the council's longest-serving member, said nobody stood up to protect the flag's heritage when bigots used the flag to spread hatred. ""That flag, each time I see it, it's harm because I have a mom that's 94 and she remembers. I have a great aunt that's 100 and she remembers,"" said Holmes-Hines, who is black. Gulfport's resolution says that any state flags that have been used in the city will be retired to the public library or other offices so they can be included in historical displays. "
100,University of California votes to restore affirmative action nearly 24 years after it was outlawed,The University of California has voted to restore affirmative action in hopes of diversifying its student body.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:04:15 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/x7JIQ8owHGc/index.html,"The University of California has voted to restore affirmative action in hopes of diversifying its student body. The unanimous decision was reached by the school's Board of Regents on Monday, nearly 24 years after it was outlawed by Proposition 209, which banned the consideration of race and gender in admissions in California. By voting, the university endorsed its repeal. The board also voted in favor of an amendment which would repeal Proposition 209 and provisions prohibiting the state from granting favorable treatment to anyone on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or nationality. ""There is amazing momentum for righting the wrongs caused by centuries of systemic racism in our country. The UC Board of Regents' votes to endorse ACA 5 and to repeal Proposition 209 plays a part in that effort,"" board chair John A. Pérez said in a statement. ""As we continue to explore all the University's opportunities for action, I am proud UC endorsed giving California voters the chance to erase a stain, support opportunity and equality, and repeal Proposition 209."" In a news release, the board said Proposition 209 challenged the university's efforts to create and maintain a student body that ""reflects California's laudable cultural, racial, geographic and socioeconomic diversity."" A demand for diversity on college campuses The goal of affirmative action in US colleges and universities is to eliminate discrimination in the admissions process by recruiting and providing incentives for groups, like minority students and women, who have been historically excluded from leadership positions in American society. Affirmative action refers to a set of policies and laws intended to combat that discrimination while promoting diversity in schools and workplaces. Supporters say it levels the playing field, promotes a healthy multicultural society and helps compensate for centuries of racial, social and economic oppression. Detractors argue it's a form of reverse discrimination that favors one group over another based on racial or gender preferences instead of academic achievement. California is one of eight states that have banned race-conscious admissions practices. ""It makes little sense to exclude any consideration of race in admissions when the aim of the University's holistic process is to fully understand and evaluate each applicant through multiple dimensions,"" UC President Janet Napolitano said in a statement. ""Proposition 209 has forced California public institutions to try to address racial inequality without factoring in race, even where allowed by federal law. The diversity of our university and higher education institutions across California, should -- and must -- represent the rich diversity of our state."" The state Assembly approved Assembly Constitutional Amendment 5 (ACA 5) on Wednesday 60-14. The legislation is now in the state Senate, where it must also pass with a two-thirds vote by June 25. If ratified, ACA 5 will appear on November 3 general election ballot, where it would need a majority vote to pass. In May, the University of  California Board of Regents also unanimously voted to waive ACT and SAT tests as an admissions requirement until 2024 to align their admission policies with ""the broad-based values of the university."" CNN's Ray Sanchez contributed to this report."
101,Iowa governor says she will issue executive order restoring felons' voting rights,Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she plans to sign an executive order that would reinstate the voting rights of Iowans who have completed their felony sentences.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:56:19 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Y0bvlFcQ8gE/index.html,"Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said she plans to sign an executive order that would reinstate the voting rights of Iowans who have completed their felony sentences. ""We're working on that right now, sitting down with various groups, listening to what they think is important what is contained in that executive order,"" Reynolds, a Republican, told reporters Tuesday in Osage, Iowa, according to Radio Iowa. ""And then I've got my legal team working on it."" CNN has reached out to the governor's office for comment. Reynolds has faced increasing pressure from state advocates who want the governor to take action, after a constitutional amendment that would restore the voting rights of former felons in Iowa failed this week in the state legislature. Iowa is the only state with a lifetime ban on voting for convicted felons unless they appeal to the governor and are granted restoration. ""We're hopeful that the governor will make good on her commitment,"" said Mark Stringer, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Iowa. After meeting with Reynolds on Friday, Des Moines Black Lives Matter activists said that the governor committed to drafting an executive order and that she would allow them to review the draft in another meeting Monday. However, the governor did not have language of an executive order or anything ready for them to review, Des Moines Black Lives Matter's lead organizer Courtnei Caldwell told CNN on Wednesday. ""We didn't get accomplished what we really need to get accomplished,"" said Caldwell, who attended the meetings with Reynolds. Caldwell also told CNN there are no plans as of yet for Des Moines Black Lives Matter to have a third meeting with the governor, but said the group intends to be at the Capitol to push for another sit-down. The governor agreed to issue the executive order sometime between late summer and early fall, according to Caldwell and the Iowa chapters of the NAACP and ACLU, two other participants in Monday's meeting with Reynolds. Some advocates say that timeline falls too close to the November general election. ""The biggest issue we're having is (the governor) is acting as if this is not urgent,"" Caldwell told CNN. ""But for folks who don't have that right to vote, this is urgent."" Betty Andrews, the NAACP's state area president for Iowa and Nebraska, told CNN on Wednesday the group would need sufficient time to educate and alert the public that their voting rights have been restored. The Iowa state legislature adjourned on Sunday and failed to pass a joint resolution that would allow for a constitutional amendment that would restore voting rights to certain convicted persons. Reynolds had signed a state Senate bill earlier this month that excluded certain felony convictions, including homicide, child endangerment that results in the death of a minor, and election misconduct, like bribery or voter fraud -- unless they received a pardon from the governor. The act also required full payment of restitution. The act would have gone into effect had the constitutional amendment been ratified. On Tuesday, Reynolds appeared to suggest that her executive order would include some of the same provisions outlined in the constitutional amendment. ""We're working on the language to see what that looks like, but hopefully it would mirror what we would put in a constitutional amendment so that we could be consistent in what we're trying to do,"" Reynolds said, according to Radio Iowa. The NAACP Des Moines, ACLU Iowa and Des Moines Black Lives Matter all told CNN that they want all Iowans with prior felony convictions to be able to vote without exceptions. Stringer told CNN that his organization is pursuing the most expansive executive order it can get from the governor. ""We don't know the contents of the executive order at this point,"" Stringer said, adding that the governor has asked for time to listen to constituents. Andrews told CNN that an executive order would allow Iowans with felony convictions to vote while they still seek a constitutional amendment, which could take as long as three to four years. ""It's not the permanent fix we'd hope for, but it is progress,"" Andrews said. Reynolds, who began her first term as governor in 2019, has supported the constitutional amendment. She reviewed and approved over 400 felon voting applications in January, according to CNN affiliate KCCI. On Tuesday, Reynolds said she still would not give up on a ""permanent solution"" from the state legislature, Radio Iowa reported. Former Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, a Democrat, had issued an executive order in 2005 to restore voting rights for residents who completed their sentences. His decision was reversed in 2011 by his successor, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad. According to ACLU Iowa, the current law has been ""especially devastating to Black communities across Iowa, where one in 10 Black adults cannot vote because of a felony conviction."" "

The entire Roosevelt High School varsity baseball team took a knee as the National Anthem played at its season opener in Des Moines on Monday night. Team members said they did it to support the ongoing protests for social justice and racial equality. Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Rayshard Brooks are just three of the victims of police brutality this year and protests in their honor continue across the country. As sports resume this summer, people are watching how athletes react to the national outcry when they go onto the field. Athletes have been taking a knee during the National Anthem to stand against police brutality since San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began the movement in 2016. In this case, it wasn't an MLB or NFL player kneeling that brought attention to a cause. It was a high school team. ""No disrespect to the flag. It's simply to bring attention to the issues at hand, and I think we did the right thing,"" Roosevelt senior Alex Pendergast told CNN affiliate WHO. The team's leadership stands by its players kneeling, Roosevelt High School Activities Manager Tracy Johnson told WHO. ""It made me feel good because our kids are in it together,"" Johnson said. ""We want those kids to be able to express themselves, and it was neat for us to see all of our kids do that."" The National Federation of State High School Associations confirmed to CNN that Iowa was the first state to resume high school sports since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

Following the wave of demonstrations sparked by the killing of George Floyd, many of us have been thinking about the history of race in America, and the ongoing narrative of police violence. We are all looking for resources to help better understand the moment. Each of the movies below offers a different perspective on how African Americans have contended with white authority over the decades and centuries. They both speak to and echo what is happening now. The films range from underground classics to big-studio productions, all of which put a human face on timely and difficult social justice issues that have shifted the conversation on racial equality in America in a way that only movies can do. If you've seen the films on this list, you can rewatch them in a new light. And if it's your first time, you might recognize something that resonates with the hundreds of Black Lives Matter and anti-racism  protests that have erupted worldwide calling for wide-reaching reform. ""Harriet"" (2019) Kasi Lemmons' recent biopic portrays the famed abolitionist Harriet Tubman (Cynthia Erivo) as a young, gun-toting heroine prepared to die for the freedom of her people. Starting out in 1849, ""Harriet"" explores the monstrous institution of slavery and how it seeped into American law enforcement in the form of marshals and paid trackers -- sometimes seen as glorified slave catchers. ""What you see in the movie are these armed posses that are after black people,"" said Donald Bogle, the film historian and author of ""Hollywood Black,"" via email. ""There's that sequence on the bridge when Harriet is cornered, after an escape, and she says, 'I'm going to be free or die' and jumps into the river. I think we can draw a connection to what's happening today and a system of pursuers, these violent white men who, in some ways, are sanctioned to murder us."" Erivo's breakout performance as Tubman (she was a double-Oscar nominee last year for best actress and original song) is worth the price of streaming alone. After making it to Philadelphia, she joins the Underground Railroad, where she becomes its most famous conductor. We learn about the prophetic visions that helped her lead approximately 70 enslaved people to freedom, as well as Tubman's command of a black army that freed 150 more in the Combahee River Raid. ""Harriet"" underscores the important role African American women have played in history, and how they continue to suffer discrimination and persecution. ""We've had these instances, like Sandra Bland, who was stopped by the cops for something so minor and, we have it on film -- the way the cop spoke to her and she spoke back -- and she was taken into custody and ended up dead,"" Bogle said. ""There's this idea that this whole system violates African American men but it can do this to African American women as well."" ""Rosewood"" (1997) John Singleton's ""Rosewood"" tells the true story of how, in 1923, a prosperous black town in Florida was burned to the ground. The fuse was lit by a white woman (played by Catherine Kellner) who falsely claimed that she was raped by a black stranger -- a story whipped up to explain the bruises inflicted by her extramarital lover. Throw in some trumped-up talk of a race riot by one of the local officials and it's not long before a group of Klansmen are swarming the town in search of a mysterious black war veteran (played by Ving Rhames). The result is a week-long massacre of torture, shootings and lynchings that Singleton shows in grisly ways on a scale that had never been done before in movies depicting slavery or its legacy. Survivors, many of them children, fled through the nearby swamps. The official death toll was eight, although many believe the final number was much higher. ""'Rosewood' effectively captured the real-life horror of racism,"" said the activist and author Dr. Umar Johnson in an email. ""The lynchings of thousands of African Americans, from the end of slavery in 1865 until the death of Malcolm X in 1965, shows just how inhumane White America can be."" The film is a powerful reminder that black lives, even entire communities, can be destroyed when someone ""weaponizes [their] whiteness,"" as the cultural critic Roxane Gay recently put it in reference to the news last month of a white woman who called the cops on a black birder in New York's Central Park after he asked her to leash her dog, which is the law. (The call was made on the same day that George Floyd was killed.) ""Selma"" (2014) Real change in society has often been the result of a political alliance between inside and outside forces. In addition to a citizen-based movement it's necessary to have government operatives or, even better, leaders like Martin Luther King who can stir the people in power to change laws. As the central figure in ""Selma,"" King (David Oyelowo) is a virtuoso combination of grace, intelligence, rhetorical power and persistence. In an early scene inside the Oval Office, he implores a reluctant President Lyndon Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) to push through the Voting Rights Act of 1965, intended to dismantle barriers that had been put in place to stop some black citizens from voting. Without it, he explains, African Americans would not have the same legal rights, but would continue to be murdered by white people, who would  either be protected by white officials or acquitted by all-white juries. ""All white,"" King says, ""because you can't serve on a jury unless you're registered to vote."" Told he'll have to wait, King organizes a massive voting rights demonstration in the South. The scenes in Ava DuVernay's protest drama are played in a stately, but intimate style. The most powerful images are of the scores of activists marching peacefully through the segregated streets of Alabama. ""Ava's film reminds people that no change has ever happened in America without a movement, and struggle, and that it is never easy,"" said writer-activist Kevin Powell, whose new book of essays, ""When We Free The World,"" is out later this month. You can feel what it must have been like to be on the front lines -- along with would-be voters (Oprah Winfrey, LaKeith Stanfield) and future Congressman John Lewis (Stephan James) -- standing up to a horde of state troopers brandishing rifles, electric cattle prods and whips. ""Selma"" went on to win an Oscar for best original song (""Glory"" by Common and John Legend) and is the rare studio movie directed by an African American woman. The film is set around the march on Bloody Sunday in 1965, and the maneuverings and events leading up to it, including the church bombing that killed four little girls in Birmingham, which was a major turning point in the civil rights movement. ""'Selma' is a case study in leadership,"" added Powell. ""It's actually a blessing to have a film to point people to as a teaching tool, to root folks in history, so they understand this is not just for us now, but for those not yet born."" ""Boyz N the Hood"" (1991) Gang violence was visible on the nightly news and MTV when this searing drama about the challenges black men face while growing up in South Central Los Angeles arrived in 1991. ""Boyz N the Hood"" was by no means the first film to tackle the subject. But it had often been done poorly: for instance, when the story is told from the perspective of the cops -- see ""Colors."" (Better yet, don't!) ""Boyz N the Hood,"" on the other hand, was notable not just for its nuanced, insider's perspective of black life on the margins, but for who was behind the camera. John Singleton was fresh out of USC film school when he became part of a new generation of black filmmakers in Hollywood to find success with mainstream audiences. In his semi-autobiographical debut, Singleton used the structure of a coming-of-age tale to show what it's like to live in a world where a trip to the corner store could end in a homicide by shotgun. The film earned him two Oscar nominations, for writing and directing, and also introduced several future stars, including Cuba Gooding Jr., Regina King and Ice Cube, who had recently launched a solo rap career after parting with the gangsta rap group N.W.A. One of the most contemptible characters in ""Boyz N the Hood"" is a black police officer (Jessie Lawrence Ferguson) who responds an hour late to a 9-1-1 call by the main character's father, Furious (Larry Fishburne). ""Homeboy shows up drinking a cup of coffee,"" said director Malcolm Lee, whose movies include ""Undercover Brother"" and the upcoming ""Space Jam: A New Legacy."" ""He feels he's better than hood Negroes because he's in law enforcement, and thinks the world would be better if Furious had killed the intruder,"" Lee said via email. ""He says, 'It'd be one less n**ga out on the streets we'd have to worry about.'"" Years later Furious's college-bound son, Tre (Gooding), is driving home at night when he's stopped by that same officer, who mistakes Tre for a possible gangbanger. Hot-headed and volatile, the cop draws his Smith & Wesson and threatens to blow Tre's head off. We watch as a single tear trickles down Tre's face. In his anguish you can sense the trauma many black people experience after encounters with the police. ""Serpico"" (1973) Last week former President Barack Obama called on local governments in the U.S. to embrace police accountability and said that, in his view, the ""vast majority"" of police officers are not violent. But the fact is that good cops can sometimes find themselves ostracized if they break rank. One of the first films to give us a realistic glimpse into life on the force was ""Serpico,"" with Al Pacino in the title role, an incorruptible detective with a fondness for wild disguises. The fact-based thriller not only turned Pacino into a star when it was released in 1973, it also depicted an out-of-control big-city police department where dirty, racist cops work over perps and take bribes from gamblers and drug dealers. ""Hey, Frank, you want a piece of this?"" asks one cop, who's assaulting a black suspect. ""No, I'm going to fill out the police card,"" Serpico replies. ""'Serpico' is a really powerful depiction of how hard it is to reform policing,"" said Touré, the writer and host of the podcast Touré Show, featuring in-depth interviews with successful black people. ""It shows how much the police will fight against those who demand more from them. The real-life Serpico risked his life to expose wrongdoing."" At first, Serpico is persuaded, then repeatedly pressured, by fellow officers to ""go along,"" before he blows the whistle on graft and corruption in the department. High-ranking city officials reportedly tried to block the investigation, which blew the lid on the documented ""code of silence,"" or blue wall, that many precincts are accused of maintaining. ""The police don't want to be policed!"" said Touré, who believes that it is how you end up with three other officers standing by as Derek Chauvin dug his knee into George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. ""It rips at the core of (the police's) culture."" ""Do The Right Thing"" (1989) New York's police force also played a critical part in Spike Lee's infernal of race, class and power in 1980s Brooklyn. Dedicated to the families of several black city residents who have died at the hands of police officers, including Michael Stewart (killed in custody in 1983 after graffitiing a subway wall), and Eleanor Bumpurs (shot twice a year later while being evicted from her public housing apartment), this controversial classic established Lee as a major director and unofficial spokesperson for the African American community. He wrote, starred in and directed ""Do The Right Thing."" The film, which is set up like a play featuring a collage of different voices, tries to show how unchecked racism and xenophobia can fester within a community because of economic inequality and intense social divisions. We get a parade of confrontational scenes between the multi-ethnic cast, which included Danny Aiello, Giancarlo Esposito, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Rosie Perez in her first role, all doing vivid characterizations. The premise is simple: a slice-of-life film set on one block on the hottest day of the year. The climax is a neighborhood riot, triggered by the killing of a black man by the NYPD. The images of Brooklynites clashing with police and vandalizing a storefront look like they could've been ripped from the current protests. The soundtrack is Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power,"" which plays throughout the film. On June 1, Lee, who won the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar in 2019 for his film ""BlacKkKlansman,"" posted a short film on Twitter called ""3 Brothers"" (he debuted it on a CNN special report with Don Lemon), that intercuts cameraphone footage of Eric Garner (a police officer was accused of Garner's death after choking him in 2014), and George Floyd, with a scene from ""Do The Right Thing,"" in which Radio Raheem (Bill Nunn) dies in a police chokehold. The short starts with the words, ""Will History Stop Repeating Itself?"" ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" (1971) Many of the people who have turned out in droves at recent protests have expressed their anger at police violence -- some have themselves clashed with baton-swinging police or have been tear-gassed or hit by rubber bullets -- and they are ready to take action. That's the kind of story Melvin Van Peebles set out to tell in ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song,"" a scrappy independent film from 1971 that made a then-impressive $10 million at the box office. The tough but silent protagonist here is played by Van Peebles, who also served as writer, director, composer and editor. In sharp contrast to previous black stars like Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte (whose characters were often neutered), Sweetback is a sexual dynamo with the ladies. For the first ten minutes, the film feels flamboyantly risque. Then Sweetback becomes radicalized -- has a full-on political awakening--  after witnessing two white officers brutalizing an innocent black militant. He intervenes, saving the brother, but kills the cops in the process. At that point the film begins to feel like a Molotav cocktail to white authority. ""Van Peebles' film was groundbreaking for its depiction of Sweetback's blatant sexuality, which poses a threat to the system,"" said film and TV producer Stephanie Allain, a longtime advocate for equity and inclusion in Hollywood, and whose credits include ""Dear White People"" and last year's Oscars telecast. ""But his cop killing separates him from society and puts him on the run, probably forever. To me, it's a statement that black male strength is frightening to 'the man.' And it still is."" ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was the first movie to reflect the politics of the Black Arts Movement, one tenet of which is for black people to promote empowering images of themselves in the media. And with its funk-soul soundtrack and shots of the black community aiding Sweetback, as he runs for his freedom, the film also seemed to hint at a grassroots revolution in cinema. It was, and it wasn't. While Van Peebles did introduce a defiant new hero who triumphed over a brutal white power structure, paving the way for the blaxploitation era of the 1970s (which at its unprecedented peak saw more than 40 black-themed movies produced over a two-year span), few films since have matched its cultural resonance. ""Queen & Slim"" (2019) If Sweetback had any offspring they would be ""Queen & Slim."" The title characters in this intriguing drama from 2019 start out at an Ohio diner, where they are on an awkward first date. She (Jodie Turner-Smith) is a black defense attorney; he (Daniel Kaluuya) works at Costco. While heading home their car is arbitrarily pulled over by a racist police officer. A scuffle ensues and they shoot and kill him in self-defense. Shell shocked, they flee the scene. The comparisons to ""Bonnie and Clyde"" are unavoidable. (""Well, if it isn't the black Bonnie and Clyde,"" says one of the characters.) Like that classic about the real-life, white, Depression-era bank robbers, ""Queen & Slim"" has outlaws who fall in love while eluding the authorities and become accidental folk heroes, in this case, because of a viral video of the officer's dashcam footage. But whereas the thrill-seeking and sex-starved antiheroes in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" were excited to see their pictures in the paper, Queen and Slim are just the opposite. They are on the lam because of the same police abuse and systemic injustice that have ignited the current protests. By making a terrifying menace out of what is assumed to be a protective force -- the police -- the filmmakers have created an audacious, lyrical film that should be required viewing for anyone who wants to understand the grief and rage of the Black Lives Matter generation. ""Queen & Slim"" was the work of director Melina Matsoukas, a young woman of color on the rise whose stylistic music videos for Beyoncé have mixed documentary and fantasy elements, and ""The Chi"" TV series creator and LGBTQ activist Lena Waithe, who called her original script ""protest art."" The filmmakers said the goal with ""Queen & Slim"" was to realistically portray what it means to be African American today, where you feel the need to regularly contemplate your own mortality, in hopes that you don't become the next hashtag, while following your own path to happiness. One criticism of the movie, however, is that it might be a little too real, or not optimistic enough anyway. ""'Queen & Slim' was very powerful and effectively communicated the psychological and emotional conflicts that exist within the black community toward the police,"" Dr. Umar Johnson said. ""On another level, I feel that the movie did a disservice to the black liberation struggle by not allowing the two protagonists to escape. It reinforced the idea that we can never successfully revolt against the white police power structure."" That may be what the film says, but then, new scripts are being written every day."
105,How lavender became a symbol of LGBTQ resistance,"Every year, as summer beckons, Pride month arrives in a burst of color. Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky.","Thu, 04 Jun 2020 14:33:35 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/iZ6heqZx8Q8/index.html,"Every year, as summer beckons, Pride month arrives in a burst of color. Around the world, rainbow flags fly high and revelers turn their faces proudly towards the sky. The multicolored flag has united the LGBTQ community for over 40 years, and though it remains a universal symbol of pride, liberation didn't always come in vibrant technicolor. In fact lavender -- a subtle hue that shifts between light pinkish purples, and gray and blueish tones -- has had, despite its whimsical nature, its own historical significance in representing resistance and power. The making of a color trend Like many aspects of queer culture, it's not surprising that lavender's unique color symbolism often skirts under the radar, especially when it comes to mainstream society. In Western culture it started life as a color of desire, thanks to the lyric genius of 7th century BC poet Sappho, whose papyrus fragments told of her erotic predilections for younger women with ""violet tiaras."" Fast forward a few centuries, and in the 1920s, violets were still drawing together members of the lesbian community, who gifted the delicate flowers as an expression of sapphic interest. It wasn't until the 19th century -- with the accidental invention of a purple synthetic dye -- that the color would become popular in fashion. ""Synthetic dyes ... allowed ordinary people to wear this special color,"" explained cultural historian and author of ""The Secret Lives of Colour"" Kassia St Clair. ""In the mid-19th century it was a fashionable color, and men would pair lavender moleskin or doe-skin trousers with blue waistcoats or claret-colored coats without anyone batting an eye."" Towards the end of the 19th century, however, the public began linking lavender with homosexuality. Aestheticism, a European arts movement was founded, eschewing Victorian wholesomeness and the perceived ugliness of the industrial age, in favor of beauty, passion and ""art for art's sake."" Newspapers denounced Aesthetes as effeminate, not least one of the prominent leaders of the movement, Oscar Wilde, who frequently reminisced about his ""purple hours"" spent with rent boys, and provoked a moral scandal with the homoerotic themes in ""The Picture of Dorian Gray."" The fight for visibility The 1930s marked the start of a dark period when lavender was cruelly lexicalized. Gay men in America were taunted for possessing a ""dash"" or ""streak"" of lavender, thanks in large part to Abraham Lincoln's biographer Carl Sandburg, who described one of the president's early male friendships as containing a ""streak of lavender, and spots soft as May violets."" During the McCarthy era, there was state-sanctioned discrimination when president Eisenhower signed Executive Order 10450, which became part of a national witch-hunt to purge homosexual men and women from the federal government. Dubbed ""The Lavender Scare"" by historian David K. Johnson, the suffocating climate of fear and suspicion subsequently led to around 5,000 federal agency employees losing their jobs on the basis of their sexuality. In 1969, the color came to symbolize empowerment. Lavender sashes and armbands were distributed to a crowd of hundreds in a ""gay power"" march from Washington Square Park to Stonewall Inn in New York, to commemorate the Stonewall riots that had just taken place a month before. It was also the year president of the National Organization for Women, Betty Friedan, denounced the lesbian membership she believed would threaten the feminist movement as a ""Lavender Menace."" This time, there was backlash. At the 1970 Second Congress to Unite Women, a group of radical activists wearing hand-dyed purple T-shirts printed with the words ""Lavender Menace"" stormed the stage and kickstarted a conversation on the very topic Friedan had struggled to suppress: lesbianism. Lavender, however, can't always be neatly defined in terms of pain or protest. Throughout history, there are endless references to its subversive possibilities, allowing LGBTQ people to express the full range of their humanity. Take the late actor and writer Quentin Crisp, whose lavender tresses were a way of visually disrupting gender norms, right up until his 90th birthday, when he held a party complete with lavender ""napkins, the plates and the frosting on the cake."" British filmmaker, artist and author Derek Jarman, meanwhile, nurtured the flower among the ""pharmacopoeia"" of medicinal plants at Prospect Cottage, his fittingly boundary-free oasis in Dungeness, southern England. He also cited violet, mallow (mauve) and lavender among the ""colours of Eden"" missing from God's rainbow in his work ""Chroma: A Book of Colour."" Then, of course, there's Gilbert Baker's rainbow flag, which he lovingly re-worked in 2017 with a lavender stripe to ""represent diversity in the era of Trump."" Living color These days, the color is being worn with confidence, nonchalance and something that feels like defiance; a nod, perhaps, to the radical protest spirit of the '70s. ""Most simplistically, fashion tends to be cyclical, so colors that haven't been in the public eye for a while are often picked up and reinterpreted by designers,"" said St Clair. ""The interlude allows the designers to reinvigorate them: they feel fresh all over again."" The color, St Clair said, has been buoyed by the milestones achieved by the LGBTQ community in recent years, including some country's moves to legalize same-sex marriage, and in the US, gay mayor Pete Buttigieg's presidential run and last year's Met Gala theme of ""Camp: Notes on Fashion."" The ""attacks on gay and transgender civil rights by the current administration,"" she added, has also increased the spotlight on the community, encouraging them ""to rally around each other and explore and celebrate identifying symbols that have been important to them in the past."" Perhaps it's why we're seeing the color's resurgence on the spring-summer 2020 catwalks -- in the form of Loewe's 17th century-inspired lace dresses, Max Mara's soft pastel suiting, Valentino's tiered minidresses, and a dress fashioned entirely from chiffon flowers at Marc Jacobs. Or more explicitly celebrated by editor-at-large of American Vogue Hamish Bowles in his flamboyant Maison Margiela Artisanal ensemble at the 2019 Met Gala. If there's one image that shows LGBTQ people that there is a joyous life out there, it's surely Bowles flicking his fringe-lined cape with campish flair. At that same event, Lena Waithe chose a lavender Pyer Moss suit to make a defiant political statement. Amid the sea of glitter and sequins, Waithe stood proud, the stripes of her ensemble stitched with the lyrics of songs sung by Diana Ross and Sylvester, buttoned with the faces of camp pioneers, and emblazoned across the back, a bold message: ""Black Drag Queens Inventend (sic) Camp."" Standing on the steps of a powerful institution, Waithe seemed to herald a new era for the LGBTQ community; one in which people can now live their truth in full color."
