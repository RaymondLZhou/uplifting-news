0,Coronavirus: Spain to allow UK tourists without quarantine,"UK travellers will be able to visit the country ""freely"" from Sunday, says Spain's foreign minister.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:10:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53122825,"UK tourists will be able to visit Spain without having to quarantine on arrival from Sunday, Spanish officials say. Spain's foreign affairs minister has told the BBC that British citizens will be allowed to enter the country freely, without the need to self-isolate. She said the decision had been made ""out of respect"" for the 400,000 Britons who have second homes in Spain. But current rules state that anyone returning to - or entering - the UK still has to self-isolate for 14 days. It is understood the UK's quarantine restrictions will be reviewed on 29 June. The UK Foreign Office is still warning against all but essential international travel. Spain's foreign affairs minister Arancha González Laya said UK visitors will go through a ""triple check"" upon arrival to Spain. They will be asked for their country of origin and to register ""so we know we have a contact point to trace them"", she said. They will also undergo a temperature check. ""We want to make sure that we welcome visitors, but we want to do this in safety and security for them, as well as for the Spaniards,"" she said. Ms González Laya said discussions were continuing with the government about exempting Spanish visitors from the UK's current quarantine travel rules. ""We do hope that [the British authorities] will be sensitive to the 250,000 Spaniards that are also living in the UK and would very much like to enter the UK without quarantine,"" she said. But she added: ""We also respect that countries look at entry or exit restrictions on the basis of their own data."" Spanish officials are also identifying locations in each of the country's regions where travellers ""will be isolated and treated"" should they require hospital treatment, according to Ms González Laya. Since 8 June, people arriving in the UK have been required to self-isolate for 14 days to help slow the spread of coronavirus. The government is now planning to relax its travel quarantine rules for some countries in early July. UK officials are talking to their counterparts in Portugal, France, Italy, Greece and Spain, and ministers are hoping to make an announcement on 29 June that the government has secured a number of ""travel corridors"". The government had previously said that the quarantine would be reviewed every three weeks and 29 June marks the end of the first three-week period. Spain's latest announcement follows confusion earlier in the week over the country's plans for allowing UK travellers to visit. Spanish officials had said on Monday that travellers from the UK would not have to quarantine on arrival from Sunday. But Spain's foreign affairs minister then suggested the country would impose a two-week quarantine on Britons, if the UK maintained its current travel rules. The mixed messages began after Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez announced last weekend that Spain's borders would reopen to travellers from all EU countries on Sunday 21 June - with the exception of Portugal. A spokeswoman for the government said the UK's quarantine system was ""informed by science, backed by the public and designed to help prevent a devastating second wave of this disease"". ""We are supporting tourism businesses through one of the most generous economic packages in the world, and continue to look at options to increase international travel, when it is safe to do so,"" she added."
1,Three children die and mother critical after Paisley fire,"The siblings, aged, 12, eight and five, died after a fire broke out in their flat on Friday night.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:06:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53119365,"Three children have died and their mother is critically ill after a fire at their flat in Paisley. The alarm was raised at about 21:00 on Friday after the blaze broke out in the upper cottage flat in Renfrew Road. Fiona Gibson, 12, and her brothers Alexander, eight, and Philip, five, died at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow. The children's 39-year-old mother was taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley in a critical condition.

2,Coronavirus: Result of 2m social distancing review 'to come next week',"Pubs and restaurants might not survive under current guidance in England, industry leaders warn.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:39:29 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53117853,"Ministers will announce in the coming week whether the 2m social distancing rule in England will be relaxed, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. The government has been reviewing the advice, amid warnings many businesses will not survive under current rules. Mr Sunak said the outcome of the review will ""make an enormous difference"" to businesses ""keen to see a change"". The government has said it hopes to reopen pubs, restaurants and hotels from the beginning of July, if safe. It has yet to give a definitive date for the hospitality sector, but ministers are preparing to ease more coronavirus lockdown restrictions on 4 July. Speaking on a visit to shops in North Yorkshire, the chancellor said although the review was yet to be completed, it was ""something that will make an enormous difference, I think, to many businesses who are keen to see a change"". The government has faced pressure from leaders of the hospitality sector and its own MPs to lessen the 2m rule, with widespread concerns around the impact it would have on the UK economy. Mr Sunak said he was ""very understanding of the calls for action on that, particularly for our hospitality industry, for our pubs, for our restaurants"". His comments came after a raft of measures reported in the Times revealed how parts of the hospitality sector could look significantly different compared to pre-lockdown. Pubs could be patrolled and people could be encouraged to use apps to order drinks, according to the newspaper. Meanwhile, the Department for Health and Social Care announced a further 128 people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 42,589. Prime Minister Boris Johnson commissioned the review on 14 June, saying there was ""margin for manoeuvre"" in the 2m social distancing rule as the number of coronavirus cases falls. The other nations of the UK have not announced any plans to change the 2m distance. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she is looking at the evidence, and Northern Ireland's Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said she is open to changing it. A coronavirus adviser to the Welsh government said the risk in reducing the distance ""isn't very big"". Earlier, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions that the government's review of the 2m rule will be ""concluding shortly, within the coming days"". Other new measures for the hospitality sector reported in the Times include: Kate Nicholls, CEO of UK Hospitality, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the guidelines seen by the industry involve businesses carrying out their own risk assessments, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach for ""everything from a burger van in a park to the Fat Duck in Bray"". Ms Nicholls said a third of pubs and restaurants could not reopen with the 2m rule in place, although all hotels could. But reducing it to 1m meant rather than generating 30% of normal revenue and losing money, businesses could break even at 70% of normal revenue. ""Every day we have delay and uncertainty about that opening date, the industry is haemorrhaging cash and jobs and livelihoods are at risk,"" Ms Nicholls said. The UK government currently advises people to stay 2m (6ft 6in) apart from others to avoid spreading coronavirus. The World Health Organization recommends a distance of at least 1m (just over 3ft), but the UK government's scientific advisers say that being 1m apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. Prof Calum Semple at the University of Liverpool, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group, said he had changed his personal view on the need for social distancing because there were now ""low levels, and sustained low levels, of transmission throughout the country"". He said 2m was still safer than 1m, but it was ""now a reasonable political decision to relax these rules""  and to open businesses where the 2m rule is harder to maintain, as long as there are other precautions in place. If the UK faces a second wave of infections, Prof Semple said it might consider imposing social distancing rules on a regional basis, with different requirements for London compared to Carlisle, for example. Some bars, restaurants and pubs say they will be unable to make a profit if the 2m guidance is still in place when they reopen. Tourism firms have also warned of tens of thousands of job losses unless the distance is shortened. The coronavirus alert level was downgraded from four to three on Friday. Under level three, the virus is considered to be ""in general circulation"" and there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"" - whereas in level four transmission was considered to be ""high or rising exponentially"". On the day, the government announced that all pupils in all year groups in England will go back to school full-time in September, alongside a £1bn fund to help England's pupils catch up with learning. There are separate rules for managing the threat of coronavirus in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

3,John Bolton: Judge rejects Trump bid to ban ex-adviser's book,A US judge denies the Trump administration's bid to halt publication of John Bolton's memoir.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:19:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53118721,"A US judge has rejected a request by President Donald Trump to stop the publication of a memoir by his former National Security Adviser, John Bolton. The justice department argued that the book had not been properly vetted. Washington DC District Court Judge Royce Lamberth said the government had ""failed to establish that an injunction would prevent irreparable harm"". Mr Bolton had ""gambled"" with US national security and  already ""exposed his country to harm"", the judge said. Hundreds of thousands of copies of the book - The Room Where It Happened - have been printed and distributed, and are due to go on sale on Tuesday. In the memoir Mr Bolton paints an unflattering picture of a president whose decision-making was dominated by a desire to be re-elected in November. Mr Trump has said the book is ""made up of lies and fake stories"". The justice department's lawyers argued that Mr Bolton had breached an obligation to complete a pre-publication review of his manuscript to ensure that it contained no classified information. Mr Bolton's lawyers dismissed the claim. They insisted that the manuscript was thoroughly examined and that Mr Trump simply did not like the contents. In his 10-page ruling, Judge Lamberth wrote that Mr Bolton had opted out of the pre-publication review process before its conclusion and that he ""likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his non-disclosure agreement obligations"". He nevertheless denied the government's injunction request. ""In taking it upon himself to publish his book without securing final approval from national intelligence authorities, Bolton may indeed have caused the country irreparable harm,"" he wrote. ""But in the internet age, even a handful of copies in circulation could irrevocably destroy confidentiality. A single dedicated individual with a book in hand could publish its contents far and wide from his local coffee shop. With hundreds of thousands of copies around the globe - many in newsrooms - the damage is done. There is no restoring the status quo."" Shortly after the decision, Mr Trump alleged on Twitter that Mr Bolton ""broke the law by releasing Classified Information (in massive amounts)"". ""He must pay a very big price for this, as others have before him. This should never to happen again!!!"" the president added. Later, the president called the ruling a ""BIG COURT WIN against Bolton"". A lawyer for Mr Bolton, Charles Cooper, welcomed the judge's decision to deny the injunction request. However, he took issue with the conclusion that his client did not comply fully with his contractual pre-publication obligation to the government. ""The full story of these events has yet to be told - but it will be,"" he added. Mr Bolton's publisher, Simon & Schuster, said: ""We are grateful that the Court has vindicated the strong First Amendment protections against censorship and prior restraint of publication."" Mr Bolton became Mr Trump's national security adviser in April 2018. He left his post in September 2019, after disagreeing strongly with the president over how to handle major challenges like Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan. In The Room Where It Happened, Mr Bolton portrays Mr Trump as an ""erratic"", ""impulsive"" and ""stunningly uninformed"" leader. Among the allegations, which are based on private conversations and are impossible to verify, are that:"
4,Coronavirus: Aberdeen family get green light to end Nepal Lockdown,Kris and Julie Smith and their two children had spent three months in a remote town.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:35:32 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-53123554,"A family from Aberdeen have been told they can continue their round-the-world trip after having to spend three months in lockdown in a remote town in Nepal. Kris and Julie Smith and their two children - nine-year-old Erihn and four-year-old Jacob - can now resume their journey to Everest Base Camp. They left Aberdeen in almost exactly a year ago to fulfil a ""big crazy dream"" of travelling around the globe. However, coronavirus lockdown measures came into force in March. Since then, they have been in a hotel next to an airport runway in Lukla - a small town in the Solukhumbu region - thousands of miles from home. On Facebook the family wrote: ""After much running about by our friend Kevin Sherpa to achieve many signatures from many authorities we have been given the green light to start walking. ""After leaving Kathmandu on the 18th March we only managed a 7 day trek before lockdown arrived. A little break in between of 3 months and off we go again ""Cannot express how excited and grateful we all are that we can continue our walk and our dream to walk onto Sagarmatha National Park and witness the worlds tallest mountain with our own eyes."" Before reaching Nepal, they had been to 18 countries including India, Jordan, Albania, Serbia and Hungary. Mr Smith, 41, had told BBC Scotland this month that conditions in Lukla were ""quite basic"" and they only had a stove in the living-room to keep warm at night. Vietnam and Sri Lanka are among locations the family still hope to reach, added Mrs Smith, 46."
5,Donald Trump: Crowds gather for Tulsa rally despite coronavirus fears,"The US president will hold his first rally since March, when the US coronavirus lockdown began.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:40:20 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53121488,"Long queues have formed outside an arena where President Donald Trump will hold his first rally since March, when the US coronavirus lockdown began. There are concerns the event at Tulsa's 19,000-seat Bank of Oklahoma Center could increase the spread of Covid-19. Those attending must sign a waiver protecting the Trump campaign from responsibility for any illness. Hours before the rally, the campaign said six staff members involved in organising it had tested positive. On Friday, Oklahoma's supreme court rejected a lawsuit asking that social distancing guidelines be followed. The Trump campaign has said attendees will have to pass temperature checks before being allowed into the venue - and that they will be offered face masks. More than 2.2 million cases of Covid-19 and 119,000 associated deaths have been reported in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Mr Trump's re-election campaign rally will be one of the biggest indoor gatherings in the US since the country's Covid-19 outbreak began. Campaign officials said they had received more than a million ticket requests, and that the president would speak inside the BOK Center as well as at an outdoor stage set up nearby for overflow crowds. Supporters began queuing earlier this week for a chance to get into the arena, and 100,000 people or more were expected to gather in central Tulsa. This week the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Oklahoma has been rising and local health officials fear the rally could become a ""super spreader"" event. There will be no social distancing at the rally. And although face masks will be given out to those attending, the president will not be wearing one. Attendees will have to accept a disclaimer that they ""voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to Covid-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc."" liable for any illness or injury. In a Facebook post, Tulsa Mayor GT Bynum acknowledged that Tulsa's residents were divided over it being the first city to host such an event. ""We do this as our positive Covid-19 cases are rising, but while our hospital capacity remains strong. Some think it is great, some think it is reckless. Regardless of where each of us falls on that spectrum, we will go through it as a community,"" he wrote. Political rallies are a source of inspiration as well as invigoration for Donald Trump. He draws energy from arenas filled with enthusiastic supporters, and uses their responses to the various riffs in his sometimes long, free-form speeches to sense what issues resonate with his loyal base. For more than three months, as Covid-19 has spread across the US, the president has had to do without these emotional and strategic sounding boards. Now, the rallies are coming back, even though cases of the virus are reaching new record peaks in many states and public health officials continue to warn of the dangers of large gatherings. With less than five months until election day, the president is billing this as the beginning of his re-election bid. Given that he held his official campaign kick-off in Orlando almost exactly a year ago, it perhaps is better seen as a re-boot of a campaign that has struggled to gain its footing as the nation has been beset by the pandemic and mass demonstrations against institutional racism and excessive force by police. The president is now billing his campaign around the slogan ""the Great American Comeback"". Given the recent turmoil, and Mr Trump's sagging poll numbers, he is clearly hoping the Tulsa rally is the beginning of his own political revival. There are also concerns among officials in Tulsa that there will be clashes between supporters and opponents of the president. Emotions are still running high following the killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, by police in Minneapolis last month, which sparked widespread anti-racism protests. Mayor Bynum declared on Thursday a curfew covering the area around the BOK Center, citing the risk of ""civil unrest"". But on Friday, Mr Trump announced that the curfew had been lifted for ""our many supporters"". He also warned: ""Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis. It will be a much different scene!"" Mr Trump had planned to hold the rally on Friday. But he changed the date last week after learning it fell on Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the US. The choice of location is also controversial. In 1921, Tulsa was the scene of a race riot in which white mobs attacked black people and businesses. At a peaceful Juneteenth rally in Tulsa on Friday, the civil rights activist Al Sharpton said campaigners could ""Make America Great"" for everybody for the first time."
6,Coronavirus: No new cases in NI for first time since lockdown,The Department of Health's daily dashboard records no new positive cases in a 24 hour period.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:39:51 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-53122657,"For the first time since lockdown began, Northern Ireland's coronavirus dashboard has recorded a full 24-hour period without any new Covid-19 cases. The dashboard covers tests carried out daily in health trust labs, but it does not include tests on national testing sites as part of NHS-wide initiatives. Health Minister Robin Swann described it as ""significant progress in forcing the virus into retreat"". The chief medical officer said NI had ""made important strides forward"". However, Dr Michael McBride warned that coronavirus remained a ""very real threat"". A total of 995 tests were completed between Thursday evening and Friday evening and none had a positive result. One further coronavirus-related death was recorded within the same 24-hour accounting period. It brings the total number of deaths reported by Northern Ireland's Department of Health to 545, but this figure refers mainly to hospital deaths. More comprehensive data collated by the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) showed the coronavirus-related death toll recently passed 800. On Saturday, the UK Department for Health and Social Care announced a further 128 people had died after testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the UK total to 42,589. In the Republic of Ireland, two further deaths were confirmed on Saturday and one previously reported Covid-19 death was removed from the official death toll. It means there have now been 1,715 coronavirus-related deaths in the Republic of Ireland since the outbreak began. After the latest testing statistics were released on Saturday, Northern Ireland's health minister and chief medical officer both welcomed the fact there had been no new cases over a 24-hour period. ""We continue to make significant progress in forcing the virus into retreat,"" Mr Swann said. ""This is due to a massive collective effort by people across Northern Ireland. ""It is vital that we all maintain this progress and keep following public health advice on social distancing and washing our hands."" Dr McBride said: ""We have undoubtedly made important strides forward and the people of Northern Ireland deserve great praise for the sacrifices they have made in our response to this virus. ""Covid-19 remains a very real threat and now is not the time to drop guard. ""I urge everyone to keep doing the right thing in terms of hand hygiene and social distancing. Please stay safe and save lives."" At the end of each working week, Nisra releases data on the number of deaths in Northern Ireland where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Nisra's most recent statistics show that by Friday 12 June, there had been 802 deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. The Department of Health's death toll refers to patients who have died with 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, whether or no the infection was the cause of their death."
7,X Factor's Alexandra Burke reveals music industry racism,"Alexandra Burke says she was told to bleach her skin and style her hair ""to appeal to white people"".","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 13:11:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53120390,"Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"". After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"". In a 15-minute Instagram video, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro. ""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people."" The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"". Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestant Misha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued"" at the hands of the music industry. Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one a live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal. ""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media. The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"". She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard. The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"". ""It's hurtful,"" she added. She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing. She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died. ""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone."" She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"". ""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind."""

Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The family-run business said it had been forced into administration as a result of the ""the devastating impact of the coronavirus lockdown"". The firm has a number of showrooms across the Midlands and was described as ""a household name"" in the region. Its shops in Birmingham, Leamington Spa, Kidderminster, Abingdon, Derby and Cheltenham were closed for three months and have only just re-opened as lockdown restrictions eased. Robert Lee is the fourth generation to run the business, which was established by Robert Lee and George Longland. ""For almost 120 years our family business and our employees have put our customers at the heart of everything we do,"" he said, adding that the company would be working to fulfil orders ""to restore our short term finances"". The company's founders were pioneers - in 1907 they became the first store outside of London to install window display lighting after closing time. Its flagship store in Birmingham was used to store food rations during the Second World War, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets. ""Lee Longlands is a household name across the Midlands,"" Matt Ingram, from administrator Duff and Phelps said. ""The fact that the appointment of administrators has been necessary, demonstrates the devastating financial impact that this pandemic will leave in its wake.""

All staff at the 2 Sisters meat processing plant in Llangefni are self-isolating after a number of workers were confirmed to have the virus on Thursday. On Saturday the number had risen to 75, Public Health Wales confirmed. Health officials said the number of cases were expected to rise and samples have been taken from about 350 staff. Testing sites were set up at Llangefni and Holyhead, and at an existing facility in Bangor, following the outbreak. All staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and are being contacted for testing. PHW, who are responding to the outbreak, said the process of taking samples from all workers was ""nearly concluded"" and ""testing was underway"". ""What's clear is that the system is working as it should - we are actively screening employees at the facility and this is helping us to identify contacts of individuals who have tested positive for Covid-19,"" said Dr Christopher Johnson from Public Health Wales. ""The advice for these contacts is to self-isolate to prevent further spread. The aim of the testing is to identify more cases and we're likely to see an increase in overall cases in the coming days."" 2 Sisters is one of the largest food producers in the UK and processes about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day from its sites across Britain. It has suspended production and closed the factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak.

10,Michael Irving: Teens jailed for 'Trojan horse trap' murder,A vulnerable 15-year-old was stabbed to death by two boys over rumours he had molested a girl.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 11:21:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-53119254,"Two teenagers have been jailed for murdering a ""vulnerable"" 15-year-old boy who was stabbed to death over rumours he had molested a girl. Michael Irving was lured into a ""Trojan horse"" trap by the boys he thought were his friends, the Old Bailey was told. The court heard the teens, now aged 17 and 16, attacked Michael after they heard he had sexually assaulted the older defendant's sister. Michael had always denied it and nothing was reported to the police. The court heard the defendants had arranged to meet Michael outside Westfield Stratford on 3 September last year. They then led him to a residential block 15 minutes away. Prosecutor Hugh Davies QC said: ""The defendants had clearly set Michael up on a friendly but false basis to meet them. It was a Trojan Horse meeting."" Michael was fatally stabbed in the heart and had four other injuries. After the defendants ran off, a passer-by stopped, held Michael's hand and comforted him as he died in the street. Judge Martin Edmunds QC said both defendants had ""murder in mind"", adding: ""No motive could justify such a cold-blooded plan."" The younger defendant admitted murder and was detained for a minimum of 10 years and six months. The older boy was found guilty of murder following a trial and was detained for at least 14 years and six months. In a victim impact statement, Michael's mother Leisa Irving said his murder had left a ""large void in all our lives"". ""My life and all the lives of my family have not been the same since. The constant feeling that something is missing - that something is Michael."" Ms Irving said her son was vulnerable because of his learning difficulties, which meant that he thought everybody was his friend.

11,Hundreds attend anti-racism rally in Glasgow,"Police, politicians and Glasgow's council had asked members of the public to avoid George Square.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:00:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53120070,"Hundreds of people staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away due to the lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland had called on the public not to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence in the square following violent scenes from a far-right group on Wednesday. Officers later confirmed one man was arrested in the nearby Gallowgate area. A police spokesman said the 42-year-old allegedly obstructed officers. A second man, aged 62, was arrested in Edinburgh for threatening and abusive behaviour. It was unclear if this was in connection with events in Glasgow or a separate protest in the capital. At about midday a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group of ultras who follow Celtic football club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of Glasgow's George Square. Anti-racism activists outside the cordon chanted: ""Let them go."" Ch Supt Alan Murray, said: ""We identified a group as football risk supporters, who we believed posed a threat to public safety. ""We spoke with this group and, at their request, escorted them to the Gallowgate area of the city where they dispersed."" Loyalists and members of a far-right group announced online on Friday night that they planned to head to the square to ""protect statues"". A small group gathered at the war memorial during the rally as lines of riot police separated the two. More than 500 people attended the rally, with stewards asking them to stick to social distancing guidelines by following markings on the square. Supporters include Stand Up To Racism, Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, Positive Action in Housing, Afghan Human Rights Foundation and unions. They had also been asked to wear masks and not to travel farther than public health advice allows.At the start of the rally, the crowd took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Later, names of people who died in police custody were read out and attendees chanted ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"". Speakers said they ""didn't come here for a fight"" and spoke of securing greater rights for refugees and asylum seekers.They added ""no-one welcomes"" the far-right group and called on police to ""do their job"". There were some minor scuffles as police controlled people arriving and leaving but the rally was peaceful. Chief Supt Murray said: ""Significant police resources were deployed at George Square to prevent the disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder witnessed in recent days. ""Those who turned up to protest were facilitated with an appropriate policing response and I would like to thank all officers involved for their professionalism in preventing trouble and maintaining public safety."" ""Our robust response will continue across the country and anyone intent on causing violence and disorder should expect arrest."" Charlotte Ahmed, of Stand Up to Racism, Scotland said: ""Today's demonstration was a magnificent expression of the unity, the anti-racism and the anti-fascism of the people of Glasgow. ""Here, in George Square, the very place where thousands of us welcomed Nelson Mandela to Scotland, we have made it clear: refugees are welcome here, Black Lives Matter, no racists in Glasgow."" Elsewhere, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of the slave trade, at St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. And the Loyalist Defence League staged a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. On Friday, Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, divisional commander, said: ""Please do not come to George Square."" She said: ""The lockdown restrictions remain in place and people should leave their homes only for very limited purposes. ""Anyone who wants to protest should find another way of doing so that keeps everyone safe."" At least six people were arrested on Wednesday following scenes labelled ""disgraceful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Far-right loyalists targeted a rally in the city's George Square which was calling for improved living conditions for refugees. The organisers vowed the rally would ""send a positive anti-racist message from Glasgow's George Square to the world""."
12,Black Lives Matter protests held across England,"People have gathered in parks and cities around the country, with many in the crowds wearing masks.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:03:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53120735,"Hundreds of people have gathered for Black Lives Matter protests in cities across England. Peaceful protests took place in London, Coventry and Newcastle - the latest in a series of anti-racism demonstrations in recent weeks. The gatherings are in breach of coronavirus lockdown rules and many in the crowds wore masks and observed social distancing guidance. The government has previously warned against protesting during the pandemic. In London protesters assembled at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park amid a heavy police presence. Another group of people marched from Vauxhall to Parliament Square. About 300 people gathered in the centre of Coventry. The protest was organised after an incident in the city's Broadgate on 9 June, where two black men were said to have been ""chased"" by a group of Coventry City fans celebrating the club's promotion. In Lydney, Gloucestershire, about 250 people gathered at the Bathurst Estate for a protest that had been cancelled, but was later allowed to go ahead following a council vote. There was singing, dancing and speeches in Times Square in Newcastle, where about 200 people demonstrated. It followed an outbreak of violence at a similar rally last weekend when counter-protesters confronted demonstrators at Grey's Monument in the city, leading to 19 arrests. Northumbria Police issued an order banning crowds from gathering at the monument, in the heart of city."

Created by the UNHCR (UN Refugee Agency) and Goal Click (a football story-telling and photo project), the new series aims to raise awareness of the rising levels of forced displacement. Photos and stories have been collected from 25 participants across five continents, for World Refugee Day on 20 June. They've come from refugee camps in Jordan, Kenya and South Sudan, and from football fields from London to Sydney. Each participant was given a disposable film camera to capture the realities of their football lives and communities. The photos and stories show how football helped the refugees and asylum seekers find their feet and rebuild their lives in new societies after the trauma and confusion of displacement. ""For young men and women uprooted by war or persecution, sport is much more than a leisure activity,"" said Dominique Hyde, global head of External Relations at UNHCR. ""[Sport is] an opportunity to be included and protected - a chance to heal, develop and grow."""
14,Canal tow-path exercise: ‘I can’t socially distance’,Canal tow-path users have increased in number by more than 170% in Birmingham during the lockdown.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:04:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-52756428,"The number of people using canal tow-paths has increased by almost 200% in urban areas since lockdown began. On a narrow tow-path, social distancing is difficult to achieve but for those with limited access to green spaces it is often one of their few options. Some canal visitors in Birmingham said they were once an ""escape"" but edging past others filled them with anxiety. The Canal and River Trust has urged people to limit their use of the waterways which remain open for all. ""Living in the city centre, canals have always been my escape,"" Ruth Millington, who lives in a studio flat in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter, said. She has no garden and relies on the city's extensive canal network for exercise and stress-relief. ""It's so important for my mental health,"" she said. With famously more canals than Venice, it is no surprise the waterways are significant to the people of Birmingham. The Canal and River Trust reported that, since lockdown came into force on 23 March, the number of people using the canals in inner-city Birmingham had increased by 171% - from a daily average of 463 to 1,254. For Ms Millington, the increase has meant her outdoor activity has had an adverse effect on her mental health instead of a positive one. ""I've found my usual walk along the canal stressful because the paths are so busy and this has added to my anxiety,"" she said. ""The narrow paths can't accommodate all of the cyclists, runners, dog walkers and groups of people walking together."" The Canal and River Trust charity reported a ""shift in usage"" from busy tourist hotspots in favour of less-used tow-paths in residential areas, ""often amongst less affluent communities where green space is often at a premium"". Burnley, Sandwell and Blackburn have seen the greatest increase in visitors to the canal network, while the number of visitors to canals in tourist hotspots such as Camden, Paddington and Birmingham's Brindley Place has dropped by more than half. A growing body of research links parks and green spaces to wellbeing, although millions of people in the UK do not have access to parks or green spaces nearby. ""My mental health is really suffering from being inside,"" Ms Millington said, adding she was now having to balance the risk of not being able to social distance against the impact on her wellbeing. It is a balance the Canal and River Trust is deeply conscious of. The charity put up signage across its network encouraging people to limit their use of tow-paths but said it was working to manage social distancing without cutting off access to green space from those least likely to have gardens or live near parks. ""Our canals provide, for many people, a vital green or blue route on-their-doorstep, but people must limit their use and act considerately at this time,"" the trust's chief executive Richard Parry said. ""Canals can be a lifeline for people, but only if we use them responsibly."" Raj Sanghera has just bought a house which backs on to the Birmingham New Main Line canal. He said the canal had become his main access route into town and, since lockdown, a place he took trips out. ""We've really embraced canal life."" He said he had noticed ""a massive increase in people"" using the tow-paths and so has had to change his habits to better maintain social distancing. ""It puts me off going at 'peak times',"" the keen runner said. ""I'm getting up earlier to go out to avoid people."" The number of visitors is exacerbated by the fact only one side of the canal is paved, he said, forcing the majority of people on to one side of the tow-path where they are further restricted by overgrown shrubbery. For boater Tim Morley, the increase in people using tow-paths has been noticeable - on some days they have been akin to ""a motorway"", he said. He lives with his partner on a boat in Hockley Port, a section of canal off Birmingham's Soho Loop near the Jewellery Quarter. ""We've been trying to exercise every day and the tow-path is the natural place to do it,"" he said. But the network was ""never designed for that volume of people,"" he said, and he has instead taken to walking around local industrial estates to avoid people using the tow-paths. ""My partner thinks I'm mad but I think they're fascinating,"" he said. ""We don't want to be near people but we also want to offer space to people who live in flats and only have access to the canals for a couple of hours a day."" Mr Morley, who works all over the world as an academic facilitator, has been living on a boat for three years. Part of the advice issued by the Canal and River Trust was for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid areas where boats are moored to protect boaters. ""When you're moored, you're inches from the tow-path,"" Mr Morley said, but added Hockley Port was closed to members of the public, ""so we don't really get people walking past us"". The Canal and River Trust said it wanted people to continue using the network, ""to enjoy the benefits of spending time by water"". ""We're just asking that they be responsible and considerate when doing so."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

15,"Beyoncé releases surprise new song, Black Parade, on Juneteenth","The new track, released on Juneteenth, calls for ""peace and reparation for my people"".","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 09:52:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53119767,"Beyoncé has released a surprise new song, Black Parade, hours after announcing a new initiative to support black-owned businesses. The track includes powerful lyrics about black history, police brutality and the George Floyd protests. ""Put your fists up in the air, show black love,"" sings the star. ""Need peace and reparation for my people."" The song was released on Juneteenth, a holiday marking the official end of slavery in the US. The celebration originated in Beyoncé's home state of Texas but is now celebrated annually on 19 June throughout the US, with varying degrees of official recognition, sometimes under the names Emancipation Day or Black Independence Day. Black Parade is Beyoncé's first solo release since last year's Homecoming, a live album and documentary covering her blockbuster performance at Coachella in 2018; and The Lion King: The Gift, which accompanied Disney's live action remake of its classic animation. ""I'm going back to the South, where my roots ain't watered down,"" she sings as the song opens. The lyrics go on to reference the Covid-19 pandemic (""Fly on the runway in my hazmat""), police brutality (""Rubber bullets bouncing off me"") and Tamika Mallory, a prominent activist in the Women's March and Black Lives Matter movements. Warning: The following song contains explicit language. End of Youtube post  by Beyoncé - Topic The track appeared on streaming services shortly after the star launched Black Parade Route, an online directory of black-owned businesses selling everything from fashion and beauty products to home furnishings and coffee.

16,Coronavirus: Is the pandemic getting worse in the US?,"Some states are seeing a spike in cases, but the White House says not to worry. So what's going on?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:23:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53088354,"The news in the US has been dominated by anti-racism protests for the past couple of weeks, but coronavirus is now back in the headlines. Several states have seen a record number of cases in recent days, leading to fears that the country is experiencing a second wave of infections. But Vice-President Mike Pence said those fears were ""overblown"" and accused the media of using ""grim predictions"" to scare the American people. So what is going on in the US? With more than two million coronavirus cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world - about a quarter of the global total. The situation got really bad in late March but by May, cases were declining and most states had begun to ease restrictions put into place to halt the spread of the virus. The number of new cases rarely fell below 20,000 though, because as some states were bringing their outbreaks under control, others were only just beginning to see flare-ups. For this reason, the top US health official for infectious diseases, Anthony Fauci, sees the current situation as a continuation of the initial outbreaks. ""People keep talking about a second wave,"" he told a reporter last week. ""We're still in a first wave."" Spikes in cases in those new hotspots mean the country's overall seven-day average has now risen for several days in a row for the first time since cases peaked in early April. The North East has been by far the worst-hit region, with about a quarter of all US cases and more than a third of all US deaths occurring in the states of New York and New Jersey. But in recent weeks, the region has brought its outbreaks under control. The South and West of the country, on the other hand, have seen a big rise in the number of infections, according to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project. There's no debate over whether cases are going up again, but there is over why. President Donald Trump blames it on increased testing, telling the Wall Street Journal he thinks ""testing is overrated"" because ""in many ways, it makes us look bad."" The US has conducted more tests than any other country - about 25 million so far - so that does go some way to explaining why it has the highest number of cases in the world, although international comparisons are difficult to make for a number of reasons. But there's plenty of evidence to suggest the recent rise in infections is down to more than just a higher number of people being tested. Twice last week, Arizona saw more new cases on its own than the entire nine-state North East region and that's not just down to increased testing. This is clear when you look at the rate of coronavirus tests that are coming back positive. If lots of tests are being done and the spread of the virus has been reduced, then the positive case rate would go down too. If the virus is still being spread widely, it goes up. At the moment the positive case rate is just below 5% nationally, which is the level the World Health Organization recommends countries be at or below for 14 days before they ease restrictions on movement. But about a third of states are above that level, as the chart below shows, and all of them have reopened to some extent over the last month. The number of people being hospitalised has also risen in a number of these states, including Texas, where some reopened bars and restaurants are now closing their doors again, reports the Texas Tribune, because of fears over a new surge of cases. Faced with rising case numbers and an economy that desperately needs to get going again, many public officials are looking to facemasks to help slow the spread of the virus. California, North Carolina and several US cities mandated or urged their use last week. But masks have become increasingly politicised in recent weeks, with President Trump saying some people wear them primarily to show opposition to him. Amid all of the fears about new hotspots, the most positive news in the US at the moment is that daily deaths continue to fall. They peaked back in May when the outbreaks in the Northeast were at their most intense, with New York state alone registering around 1,000 a day. This week, that figure is about 40 a day. However, deaths is a metric that lags behind cases and hospitalisations because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-hit to die from the disease. That means the consequences of the current spikes in cases won't be seen for a couple of weeks at least. If we do see the number of deaths edging up, there will likely be some pressure on governors to reintroduce restrictions but Dr Fauci doesn't think that will happen. ""I don't think we're going to be talking about going back to lockdown,"" he said last week. ""I think we're going to be talking about trying to better control those areas of the country that seem to be having a surge of cases."" Researchers are racing to produce a vaccine but it's clear that Americans, and the rest of the world, are going to be living with the virus until next year at the earliest. So far, the US has recorded about 120,000 coronavirus deaths - the highest death toll in the world. But one forecasting model run by experts at the University of Washington, which has been cited by the White House in the past, predicts that number will have passed 200,000 by October - a month before the election."
17,Greta Thunberg: Climate change 'as urgent' as coronavirus,Greta Thunberg says the world needs to treat climate change with similar urgency to Covid-19.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 05:47:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53100800,"Greta Thunberg says the world needs to learn the lessons of coronavirus and treat climate change with similar urgency. That means the world acting ""with necessary force"", the Swedish climate activist says in an exclusive interview with BBC News. She doesn't think any ""green recovery plan"" will solve the crisis alone. And she says the world is now passing a ""social tipping point"" on climate and issues such as Black Lives Matter. ""People are starting to realise that we cannot keep looking away from these things"", says Ms Thunberg, ""we cannot keep sweeping these injustices under the carpet"". She says lockdown has given her time to relax and reflect away from the public gaze. Ms Thunberg has shared with the BBC the text of a deeply personal programme she has made for Swedish Radio. In the radio programme, which goes online this morning, Greta looks back on the year in which she became one of the world's most high-profile celebrities. The then 16-year-old took a sabbatical from school to spend a tumultuous year campaigning on the climate. She sailed across the Atlantic on a racing yacht to address a special UN Climate Action summit in New York in September. She describes world leaders queuing to get pictures with her, with Angela Merkel asking whether it was okay to post her photo on social media. The climate campaigner is sceptical of their motives. ""Perhaps it makes them forget the shame of their generation letting all future generations down"", she says. ""I guess maybe it helps them to sleep at night."" It was in the UN that she delivered her famous ""how dare you"" speech. ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words"", she told the world leaders gathered in the UN Assembly. She appeared on the verge of tears as she continued. ""People are dying,"" she said, ""and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?"" She knew it was a ""lifetime moment"" and decided not to hold anything back, she says now. ""I am going to let my emotions take control and to really make something big out of this because I won't be able to do this again"". She describes travelling back from the UN to her hotel on the subway and seeing people watching the speech on their phones, but says she felt no urge to celebrate. ""All that is left are empty words"", she says. The phrase reflects her deep cynicism about the motives of most world leaders. ""The level of knowledge and understanding even among people in power is very, very low, much lower than you would think,"" she told the BBC. She says the only way to reduce emissions on the scale that is necessary is to make fundamental changes to our lifestyles, starting in developed countries. But she doesn't believe any leaders have the nerve to do that. Instead, she says, they ""simply refrain from reporting the emissions, or move them somewhere else"". She claims the UK, Sweden and other countries do this by failing to account for the emissions from ships and aircraft and by choosing not to count the emissions from goods produced in factories abroad. As a result, she says in her radio programme, the whole language of debate has been degraded. ""Words like green, sustainable, 'net-zero', 'environmentally friendly', 'organic', 'climate-neutral' and 'fossil-free' are today so misused and watered down that they have pretty much lost all their meaning. They can imply everything from deforestation to aviation, meat and car industries,"" she said. Ms Thunberg says the only positive that could come out of the coronavirus pandemic would be if it changes how we deal with global crises: ""It shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force."" She says she is encouraged that politicians are now stressing the importance of listening to scientists and experts. ""Suddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life."" She hopes that will open up a discussion about the urgency of taking action to help the people who die from illnesses related to climate change and environmental degradation right now as well as in the future. But she remains deeply pessimistic about our ability to keep any temperature increases within safe boundaries. She says that, even if countries actually deliver the carbon reductions they've promised, we'll still be heading for a ""catastrophic"" global temperature rise of 3-4 degrees. The teenager believes the only way to avoid a climate crisis is to tear up contracts and abandon existing deals and agreements that companies and countries have signed up to. ""The climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today's political and economic systems"", the Swedish climate activist argues. ""That isn't an opinion. That's a fact."" Thunberg talks movingly of a road-trip she and her father took through North America in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Hollywood actor turned politician and climate campaigner. She visited the charred remains of Paradise, the Californian town destroyed by a wildfire in November 2018. She is shocked by the carbon-intensive lifestyles she saw in the US.  ""Apart from a few wind power plants and solar panels,"" she says, ""there are no signs whatsoever of any sustainable transition, despite this being the richest country in the world."" But the social inequities struck her just as forcefully. She describes meeting poor black, Hispanic and indigenous communities. ""It was very shocking to hear people talk about that they can't afford to put food on the table"", she explained. Yet Greta Thunberg says she has been inspired by the way people have been responding to these injustices, particularly the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in May. She believes society has ""passed a social tipping point, we can no longer look away from what our society has been ignoring for so long whether it is equality, justice or sustainability"". She describes signs of what she calls an ""awakening"" in which ""people are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact"". That is why Greta Thunberg says she still has hope. ""Humanity has not yet failed"", she argues. She concludes her radio documentary in powerful form. ""Nature does not bargain and you cannot compromise with the laws of physics,"" the teenager asserts. ""Doing our best is no longer good enough. We must now do the seemingly impossible. And that is up to you and me. Because no one else will do it for us."" A longer version of Justin Rowlatt's interview with Greta Thunberg will be available next week.  You can listen to the English language version of Greta Thunberg's programme for Swedish Radio here. Follow Justin on Twitter."
18,Mariana Trench: Don Walsh's son repeats historic ocean dive,"Sixty years after his father did it first, Kelly Walsh dives to the deepest point in Earth's oceans.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:45:42 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-53112621,"It used to be said that more people had walked on the surface of the Moon than had dived to the deepest part of Earth's oceans. Not anymore. Kelly Walsh, the son of the great ocean explorer Don Walsh, has just descended to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost 11km down in the Pacific. He made the dive 60 years after his father created history in doing so. It means Kelly is the 12th person to visit the trench floor - the same as the number of Apollo moonwalkers. The 12-hour dive on Saturday saw him reach a depth of approximately 10,925m. Kelly described it as ""a hugely emotional journey"" after returning to the surface. The descent was piloted by the financier and adventurer Victor Vescovo. The Texan is conducting a series of dives into the lowest point of the Mariana Trench known as the Challenger Deep. Mr Vescovo has acquired a support ship and human-rated submersible that he is using to survey several of the most extreme places on the ocean floor. Recent passengers who've gone down with him to the Challenger Deep include the first women to make the journey - the former Nasa astronaut Kathy Sullivan and the British-American mountaineer Vanessa O'Brien. But Kelly Walsh's descent is particularly noteworthy because of his father, Don. On 23 January, 1960, the then US Navy officer, accompanied by Swiss national Jacques Piccard, made the first crewed dive to the floor of Earth's deepest ocean trench using the bathyscaphe Trieste. It was an astonishing achievement given the precarious nature of the expedition. The trench is so deep, it would be possible to fit Mount Everest (8,848m) inside it and still have more than 2km of water above the peak. The pressure at the trench floor is crushing - some 100 million pascals, almost 16,000 pounds per square inch. Sixty years on, modern technology means Victor Vescovo can reliably make very safe, repeat dives, so much so that he himself has now been down seven times in his submersible, the 12-tonne Deep Sea Vehicle (DSV) Limiting Factor. On Saturday, Vescovo and Walsh spent fours hours at the bottom of what's called the ""western pool"" - one of three distinct zones in the Challenger Deep. It's the same pool that Don Walsh and Piccard visited, and the latest dive marked the first time anyone had been back since. The Scottish marine biologist Alan Jamieson is one of the 12 who've made the dive to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. He went with Mr Vescovo to a slightly shallower (10,700m) location just to the east of Challenger Deep known as the Sirena Deep. Of Kelly Walsh's dive, he said: ""It's a commemoration of what his father did. It's also a kind of demonstration that we haven't lost that capability. People often ask why we don't seem able at the moment to go to the Moon having done it in the 60s and 70s. Likewise, with the deep ocean, Don Walsh went to the bottom of the Mariana Trench and then for several decades we didn't go anymore. But now we're showing we can do it again, and we're doing it loads."" Dr Jamieson is in the process of joining up with Mr Vescovo's expedition. There's a plan to take the DSV Limiting Factor shortly to the Philippine Trench, which in terms of depth at 10,500m is third only to the Mariana and Tonga trenches. But it's a highly significant location in the history of ocean exploration, explained Dr Jon Copley from the University of Southampton. It's where the Danish Galathea expedition in 1951 trawled animals from more than 10km down. It was the first proof that higher animals could live deeper than 10,000m, he told BBC News. Victor Vescovo's exploits can be followed on the website of Caladan Oceanic, which has organised the venture with Triton Submarines, who developed the Limiting Factor, and EYOS Expeditions. Dr Copley keeps a history of ocean exploration on his blog. Source: Dr Jon Copley @expeditionlog Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos"
19,The 94-year-old fighting for re-election after 49 years as mayor,"Fifty years in public office has not dampened André Trigano's desire to be mayor of Pamiers, France.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 01:17:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-53113686,"In France, 36,000 villages, towns and cities held the first round of mayoral elections in March and will finally hold the second round next weekend, after a three-month delay caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Chris Bockman interviewed one of the hopefuls - the nonagenarian André Trigano. ""I hope I am not going to have to apologise again for not being dead."" That was my introduction to the dapper, and witty, mayor of the town of Pamiers, in the foothills of the French Pyrenees - population, 16,000. André Trigano is 94 years old and has been in public office for close to 50 years, but he isn't planning on retiring for a while yet. He came top in the first round of the election in March and if he wins the second round on 28 June he will be 101 years old at the end of his mandate. There are other elderly mayors clinging on to the reins of power - including a 98-year-old standing for re-election in a village near Bordeaux - but none has a back story quite as colourful as Trigano's. Born in Paris in 1925, he was a teenager during the German occupation of the city in World War Two. His parents, Jewish immigrants from Algeria, were advised to flee by a police officer living in their building, who told them that the Gestapo had drawn up a warrant for their arrest. They took cover in the mountainous Ariège region, in the south of France, and the young Trigano joined the Resistance. He forged documents to help allied servicemen - often airmen who'd been shot down - escape to Spain. He was arrested three times, but somehow he survived. After the war, he chose to stay in the south and went into business. His experiences during the occupation had convinced him that the only way to prevent a repeat of the horrors of the past was to get people from different backgrounds and nationalities to go on holiday together. His father and an elder brother had set up a tent-making business before the war and he set up a camping holiday business. Then the family got a contract to supply tents to the newly created Club Med, and André's brother Gilbert, went to work for the company becoming its financial director, then its president and director general. Although Club Med is now renowned for luxury hotels, for the first 15 years of its existence guests stayed in tents and grass huts, and André helped to source some of the original tents - US Army surplus tents for 10 people that were abundant after the war in continental Europe, and cheap. The idea was to provide simple communal holidays in the sunshine, in locations such as Majorca, Corfu and Djerba in Tunisia. The Club Med mantra, which André Trigano would have approved of and may have helped to inspire, was that everyone was equal on holiday. The Trigano tent-making business prospered, thanks partly to the French state's decision in the mid-1950s to increase paid leave to three weeks per year. It became a major player in the outdoor goods and caravan industry with the slogan, in the 1970s, Le camping - c'est Trigano (Camping - it's Trigano). Meanwhile, André's outdoor holiday firm accumulated dozens of campsites in France, Spain and Portugal. The cash helped him assemble a collection of 120 classic cars, including vintage Citroens, Cadillacs, Triumphs, Rolls Royces, and an Excalibur. But increasingly Trigano focused on politics, turning this corner of the Pyrenees into his personal political fiefdom. He has been mayor of Pamiers, the largest town in the Ariège, for 25 years. Before that he was mayor of a smaller town, Mazeres, for 24 years - and simultaneously, for a while, an MP in the national parliament in Paris. He says his personal wealth inspires trust: people are less worried he'll try to use his position for his own profit. So why, after all this time in public office, is he running again? He says he still has plenty of unfinished business, including plans to renovate the centre of Pamiers, which is a pocket of poverty surrounded by dozens of factories working overtime to make parts for the aerospace industry. ""Every night I go to sleep and wake up with a dozen great new ideas for the town,"" he says. But his age has, inevitably, been used against him by his rivals. The two I spoke to both said it was time for him to go. Yes, he did a lot for the town in the past, said one of them - Maryline Doussat, who runs a local bakery with 20 employees - but he's turned into an elderly autocrat. This explains Trigano's joke about hoping he won't have to apologise for not being dead. ""Do I sound lucid? Do I make sense?"" he asks me rhetorically, an hour into the interview. These young - or at least, younger - wannabes must wait their turn, he says. ""When you build a 10-storey building, you don't change architects after the fifth floor - that makes no sense,"" he chuckles. With a twinkle in his eye, he tells me that he has run in 19 different elections from mayor to regional council and parliament, and lost just once. ""If anyone wants my job, they will have fight for it!"" Chris Bockman is the author of Are you the foie gras correspondent? Another slow news day in south-west France.

20,Coronavirus: 'Deadly masks' claims debunked,The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been investigating misleading claims about the health risks of face masks.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:21:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/53108405,"This week, face masks became mandatory on public transport in England, and changes to the use of face coverings in hospitals were introduced. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been investigating misleading claims about the health risks of face masks. Here is a look at some of the most widely seen examples on social media. Most people won't find masks very comfortable, but this article is looking at claims that wearing them is actually dangerous. A diagram taken from Wikipedia showing the ""symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity"" has been re-edited and shared thousands of times on Facebook. The modified version claims that wearing a mask leads to ""re-breathing your exhaled CO2"". People have attached the image to comments under BBC News articles about the new rules. We've seen lots of posts alerting people to this potentially harmful side-effect - called hypercapnia - where there's too much carbon dioxide in the blood. But it's highly unlikely you'll suffer it wearing a cloth or gauze face mask. ""This simply won't happen unless there is an air-tight fit and you rebreathe your air,"" says Prof Keith Neal, an infectious disease expert. Carbon dioxide molecules are tiny - far smaller than droplets containing coronavirus which the masks are designed to stop - and won't be trapped by a breathable material, particularly during relatively short periods like a bus journey. When you breathe out, the carbon dioxide will go through and round the mask. Surgeons regularly wear much heavier-duty face coverings all day without coming to harm. ""There have been reports of some medics developing headaches linked to wearing personal protective equipment for long periods of time, but it's still highly unlikely they would suffer from some of the more extreme effects of carbon dioxide toxicity,"" says Rachel Schraer, BBC Health reporter. The World Health Organization (WHO) says masks could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"". Home-made cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. Read more from the BBC's Michelle Roberts on why we're asked to wear masks in some settings. The question of whether or not to wear a mask has been polarising opinion in the United States for weeks. Some states and local governments have legislated to make wearing face coverings in public places compulsory, and some stores have introduced their own policies requiring shoppers to wear masks. This has led to a debate online about civil liberties. Plandemic, a viral conspiracy video full of false claims about coronavirus, included an assertion that wearing a mask ""literally activates your own virus"", when there is no evidence to support this claim. This led to Facebook removing the video from its platform when it went viral in May. Former professional baseball player Aubrey Huff this week vented his anger about being required to wear a mask, in a video on Twitter, which was viewed 1.6 million times. In it, he claims: ""It's not healthy to breathe in your own CO2 all the time"", but as we've seen there's no evidence that wearing a face covering causes you to breathe in more CO2. He concludes: ""I would rather die from coronavirus than to live the rest of my life in fear and wearing a damn mask"". Opponents of mandatory mask legislation are protesting against lawmakers' decisions. Last week, the LA Times reported that a public health official resigned from her role after mandating masks in public places in Orange County, California. Protesters created posters of  her with a Hitler moustache and swastikas, and she was on the receiving end of what was interpreted as a death threat. Some people who dispute the need for masks claim the pandemic is either a hoax or exaggerated, despite the hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. A meme that has been widely shared on US Facebook groups since mid-May asks why we are distancing, if masks work. The easy answer is that neither method gives the population full protection, but having both can help limit the spread of the virus. The meme then goes on to conclude; ""Because it's not about the virus. It never was."" However, new requirements to wear masks are certainly related to the coronavirus pandemic and efforts to stop the spread of the virus. One example of the meme from a conservative Latino Facebook page has been shared 26,000 times. Another theme in misleading posts surrounding the use of masks is that they limit the amount of oxygen getting into the body. One graphic titled ""danger of a face mask"" says this ""may lead to death"". But the breathable materials recommended for face masks worn properly won't inhibit your breathing. Breathlessness is a sign that your body is deprived of oxygen - known as hypoxia. ""Thin paper or cloth masks will not lead to hypoxia. Surgeons operate for hours wearing them. They don't get these problems,"" says Prof Neal. The WHO says: ""The prolonged use of medical masks when properly worn, does not cause CO2 intoxication nor oxygen deficiency. ""While wearing a medical mask, make sure it fits properly and that it is tight enough to allow you to breathe normally. Do not re-use a disposable mask and always change it as soon as it gets damp."" These oxygen-depleting claims have appeared in many different languages: English, German, Serbian and Hebrew Facebook posts alongside the same stock image of a toddler in a mask. An article on a Nigerian news site, originally translated from Spanish, carried the claim back in April and has been shared 100,000 times. There are some situations in which face masks might not be advised: Additional reporting by  Alistair Coleman, Peter Mwai, Olga Robinson, Shayan Sardarizadeh and Rachel Schraer.

21,Christmas 2020: Will Santa have to social distance?,"With social distancing still in place and fears of a second peak, will Christmas outings be cancelled?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:01:47 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-53055224,"The coronavirus pandemic has already seen off Easter parties and summer festivals - will Christmas outings suffer the same fate? It may be June but lots of parents of young children will tell you Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. But while many events have started taking bookings, the question remains whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. A visit to a grotto, Christmas show or winter fair is an annual tradition for many families but the magic may feel somewhat lost if Santa has to wear a mask. Some venues have already cancelled their festive events such as the Telford Steam Railway. The heritage line organises a Polar Express train service each year where families board a train decorated like the one in the animated film. The trips attract hundreds of people, many of whom travel from faraway for the event. It is also a major fundraiser for the line which saw turnover go from £100,000 a year to more than £1m. A statement from the board of directors said it would be ""irresponsible to put any lives at risk"". ""This is one of the hardest decisions we have had to make as this event has a massive impact to our railway business, but the health of you and your family is more important to us especially around the festive period."" Other cancelled events include the Christmas light switch on in Ely and the Whitby Christmas festival. However other venues are taking bookings for Christmas events such as Legoland in Windsor and the Snowdome in Tamworth, which hosts Santa's Winter Wonderland every year. Organisers are yet to make a decision on festive markets such as the Frankfurt Christmas market held in Birmingham. It's not that surprising that events like Christmas fairs which attract large groups of people in close proximity might be off the table but what about the annual visit to Santa. Will we see elves in PPE and will St Nick, as an older gentleman, have to shield in the North Pole? Not according to Matthew Wise, managing director of Great Grottos, which runs more than 200 grottos in shopping and garden centres across the UK. He said: ""Great Grottos expects the Christmas grotto to move away from enclosed structures towards more expansive open staged settings with decorative backdrops."" He said this will allow staff and guests to social distance safely. ""If the downward trend in Covid-19 cases continues, garden centre grottos may prove to be the likely winners. They are able to delay their decision making on Christmas until the latest point and react more immediately."" He added grotto managers will be watching the retail sector for the next month now that non-essential shops have reopened to see how consumers and retailers behave post lockdown. In the meantime the recruitment of 500 Santas and elves has been pushed back to later in the year and some Father Christmases may audition via video call or using sanitised interviewing conditions. Could the drive-in cinema finally take off in the UK? What to expect when hairdressers reopen What will a post-lockdown high street look like? At theatres, crowds, artists and stagehands may find the annual pantomime is a very different experience going forward. In Chesham, the Bucks Free Press reported that the local panto has been changed from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty to reduce the number of performers backstage. Martin Dodd, producer and managing director of UK Productions, said the usual business of auditions, set building and costume making is on hold for his 10 scheduled shows. ""We work on pantomimes all year round in our workshops and warehouses as well as casting, marketing, writing scripts and designing new productions,"" he said. ""But with all of our premises closed and most of our staff furloughed this has obviously not been possible."" Auditions for ensemble members and juveniles are usually held from Easter with principal performers cast in July but while first round auditions can be done via video it is more difficult to put teams of dancers together while maintaining social distancing rules. Mr Dodd added: ""However the biggest question mark over Christmas is whether theatres will be able to open and whether we will be able to guarantee that we can keep the show on. ""Social distancing rules, even if it were to come down to one metre, means the theatres and producers will be losing money, but equally worrying is the risk of having to quarantine a whole company or theatre, which could mean cancellations of two weeks for every case. ""Such a scenario would simply be unsustainable financially for us as producers and also for the theatre."" In May the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced the appointment of a Commissioner for Cultural Recovery and Renewal to support the sector's recovery from the pandemic. Mr Dodd said the industry needed financial support ""both in terms of reduced audience numbers and as insurance against quarantine/isolation losses and/or a return to lockdown"", as well as guidelines on how to rehearse safely. There is also the cultural impact to consider, often pantomime is an introduction to the theatre for new and young audiences, adds Mr Dodd. ""Pantomimes are also so special in that they provide a way of bringing young and old together in a way not seen in any other country and given the isolation and separation felt by so many families this year wouldn't it be great if the family trip to the pantomime could still happen?""

22,Debbie Kaore: The attack that highlighted an epidemic of abuse,"After an assault on rugby player Debbie Kaore went viral, will things change in Papua New Guinea?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:21:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52978324,"Before last week, Debbie Kaore was best known in Papua New Guinea as a champion boxer who won gold at the Pacific Games in 2015 and had recently made a career-changing move to rugby. Then last Friday, a video was widely shared on social media that showed Ms Kaore being violently attacked with a hot iron in her home. The video was posted on TikTok and Instagram by her friend, with permission, and went viral. Ms Kaore's partner Murray Oa, a lieutenant in the Papua New Guinean army, was arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. Graphic pictures showed terrible injuries on the rugby player's face and body. ""I realised if I didn't get out of our room, he would burn me alive,"" she said in an interview with the BBC. The footage of Ms Kaore's assault has shone a light on the extent of domestic abuse in Papua New Guinea, and led to statements of support for her from the UN and the nation's Prime Minister James Marape, who urged Papua New Guinea's men to ""leave that lady alone"". But too many of the nation's women would have been able to empathise with what they saw in the video. As many as two-thirds have experienced domestic violence, according to one study by the UN. Ms Kaore started seeing Mr Oa just over a year ago. The first attack happened when she was about two months pregnant, she told the BBC. ""And from then on he continued to verbally, mentally and emotionally abuse me,"" she said. ""I was psychologically breaking down."" On 4 June, she posted a video on the app TikTok. It was a response to a video posted by her sister's ex-boyfriend, creating a duet which showed the two in split-screen - a feature of the app. Happy with the result, she shared it via her Whatsapp status. She told the BBC that Mr Oa saw it while out having drinks, and returned home shortly after. ""I saw him parking the car across the road, and noticed that he looked uneasy,"" Ms Kaore recalled. ""He came in, walked up to me and asked for my phone so he could send an email. So I gave it to him, and he went into our room and viewed my WhatsApp video again."" She said he called her into the room and started questioning her about the video. ""But as I started showing him my phone, he punched me down and picked up the iron,"" she said. Mr Oa burned her across the face and stomach with the iron, she said, and headbutted her, while demanding to see her Facebook account. Her two sons from a previous relationship, both younger than 10, saw the attack. She managed to escape through a back door and call her father, who picked her up and took her to hospital. ""I got burned by an iron and then hit by it while our children watched,"" she wrote on social media afterwards. ""A victim to Lt. Murray Oa … I am putting this out here cause this has gone too far. I can only hope that there won't be another victim after me."" With Ms Kaore's permission, one of her friends posted footage of the attack online the following day. It went viral, forcing to the surface conversations about the country's widespread domestic violence problem. Mr Oa was arrested and charged with grievous bodily harm. He has yet to comment on the incident. The prime minister, among other high profile figures, released statements condemning not just Debbie's attacker but domestic abuse in general. Papua New Guinea's Olympic Committee and Rugby Association both spoke out in support of Debbie too. But what happened to her was not a one off. In 2016, the charity Human Rights Watch called Papua New Guinea one of the most dangerous countries in the world for women and girls. The violence is so systemic that many women don't seek help until it's too late, said Kate Schuetze, Pacific researcher at Amnesty International. ""It becomes so normalised in society and in culture that people don't think to get help when they experience abuse,"" she told the BBC. ""The day-to-day levels of violence are extremely high. Often only once a woman needs serious medical help will they seek help or try to escape that relationship."" For people outside Papua New Guinea's cities, the barriers to seeking help are particularly high. About 80% of the country's population lives in rural areas with little access to emergency or other supportive services. One woman was forced to walk for five days from a rural part of the country's Highlands to reach hospital, after a severe assault, Ms Schuetze said. ""There are a lot of rural areas around there that don't have good transport infrastructure, which is why she had to walk. But she said to me that if she hadn't gotten out of that situation, she wouldn't have lived."" Women facing domestic abuse are also trapped by financial obstacles. In parts of Papua New Guinea, significant sums of money - known as a ""bride price"" - are paid by a groom to the bride's family. There is a fear that if a woman escapes, her family will be expected to repay the sum to her husband. And widespread drug and alcohol abuse among men was also a part of the problem, said Professor Judy Atkinson, the founder of We Al-li, a group which works with indigenous communities in Australia and Papua New Guinea. ""It's a major problem in the community,"" she said. ""They're being marketed on the streets in Papua New Guinea - and that creates violence, and leads to a culture of violence."" In 2013, Papua New Guinea passed the Family Protection Act, criminalising domestic violence and allowing victims to obtain protection orders. It became law four years later, but enforcement remains ""weak and inconsistent"", according to Human Rights Watch. Complaints of intimate partner violence are often not taken seriously by the police, or the officers involved lack the training to deal with the case effectively and sensitively, said Ms Schuetze. Papua New Guinea's police force is relatively small, and a lack of legal support can make it too costly for many to seek justice through the courts. A 2019 report by the charity said police and prosecutors ""rarely pursued investigations or criminal charges against people who commit family violence - even in cases of attempted murder, serious injury, or repeated rape - and instead prefer to resolve such cases through mediation and/or payment of compensation"". Ms Kaore said she hoped the unusually high level of coverage prompted by her assault last week would hasten change. ""I'm thankful for the love and support I'm getting from all over the world. Knowing I'm not alone in this means so much to me and my family,"" she said. ""I can only hope things will change after this. I hope to see that people can be educated properly and learn to respect one another, and change their mindsets."""
23,Coronavirus: What's the chance of going on holiday?,"Is it now possible to go on holiday, either in the UK or abroad?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:22:45 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52646738,"The chance of having a summer break abroad in 2020 seems remote - with the Foreign Office still warning against non-essential travel, and quarantine rules making many trips impractical. However, the holiday industry in parts of the UK looks set to start operating again during July. Self-catering holiday accommodation will reopen in Northern Ireland from 26 June, and hotels will follow a week later on 3 July. A decision will be taken in Wales on 9 July on whether to open up the country to tourists again. If this is given the go-ahead, it's likely to take effect from 13 July. The Welsh government has said that people can start booking holidays in self-contained accommodation from that date onwards. This includes self-catering cottages and apartments, caravans with their own bathroom facilities, and hotels which can provide room-service meals. The Scottish government has said that hotels and tourist accommodation may be able to reopen from 15 July at the earliest, if its next review of lockdown restrictions on 9 July decides that conditions are favourable. Government advice in England still says that businesses providing holiday accommodation - including hotels, campsites, caravan parks and short-term lets - should stay closed for leisure-related trips. No person should stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose, it adds. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden says he's keen get the tourism sector going as ""rapidly as possible"" with the government sticking to what it describes as an ""ambitious target"" to get England's tourism sector back by 4 July - ""as long as it is safe to do so"". At the moment, it's difficult. British nationals are still being urged not to take any non-essential foreign travel. This means you are unlikely to get travel insurance, because insurers take their cue from the official advice. But the airlines are hopeful for the summer season. EasyJet has started limited flights in June, and hopes to resume flights on 75% of its route network by the end of August, while Ryanair and British Airways plan to ramp up their services in July. On 15 June the European Union lifted travel restrictions, leaving it to individual countries to decide if they're ready for tourists. Some, including France, Germany, Italy and Portugal are now welcoming travellers from the UK. Others, such as Ireland, require visitors to quarantine for 14 days upon entry. Greece is open, but tourists will have to be tested for coronavirus upon arrival. Anybody testing positive will have to quarantine for 14 days. British holidaymakers are currently unable to enter Australia, India and the US. They will also have to spend two weeks quarantined in a hotel upon arrival if they wish to visit New Zealand. Most travellers will also have to quarantine for 14 days upon their return to the UK. The government hopes to set up a system of ""air bridges"" with other countries. These would exempt travellers from quarantine, if they move between countries with low virus levels. Again, it's impossible to say at this stage. Travel advice will need to have been updated, but it depends on the disease's progress. If your package holiday or flights have already been cancelled, then you are are entitled to a full cash refund. However, lots of people have been struggling to get their money back, and have been offered vouchers or rebooked trips instead. If you are offered a voucher, or a free rebooking instead of cash, you can accept or refuse it. But if the airline later folds, the voucher may no longer be valid. If your airline or holiday company hasn't cancelled your holiday yet, but you no longer wish to travel, you may not be entitled to a refund. However, some providers are allowing people to rebook trips for a later date at no cost. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
24,Coronavirus: Should I start taking vitamin D?,Some people might want to consider it during the pandemic. Here's why.,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:44:03 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52371688,"There are mounting questions about whether vitamin D has a role to play in the fight against coronavirus. Several organisations, including the health watchdog the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE), are now reviewing the evidence. With more people staying indoors during the pandemic, some people may have been deprived of vitamin D. Normally, many of us get it by spending time outside. Our skin makes it when exposed to the sun. The NHS says people should consider taking 10 micrograms of vitamin D a day during this time - particularly if they spend most of their time inside. Before the pandemic people in the UK were already advised to consider taking supplements during the winter months (from October to March). Meanwhile Public Health England recommends vitamin D throughout the year if: People with dark skin may also not be getting enough, even if they spend time outdoors, and should consider an all-year-round supplement. Scottish and Welsh governments and Northern Ireland's Public Health Agency have issued similar advice for the lockdown period. It is well known that vitamin D is important for healthy bones, teeth and muscles. A lack of it can lead to a bone deformity illness called rickets in children, and a similar bone weakness condition called osteomalacia in adults. There are also suggestions that vitamin D boosts the immune system and helps fight off infections. Some studies suggest ensuring adequate vitamin D levels help when we have common colds and flu, for example. But evidence from research is inconsistent. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) is now reviewing studies looking at the impact of vitamin D on chest infections. According to the NHS there is currently not enough evidence to support this. But experts do think that it may have some broader health benefits during the pandemic. According to a report in BMJ Nutrition, Prevention and Health, ""As a key micronutrient, vitamin D should be given particular focus - not as a 'magic bullet' to beat COVID-19, as the scientific evidence base is severely lacking at this time - but rather as part of a healthy lifestyle strategy to ensure that populations are nutritionally in the best possible place."" Some researchers have suggested that vitamin D deficiency might be linked with poorer outcomes if someone catches coronavirus. But other underlying risk factors, such as heart disease, are common in these patients too, making it hard to draw conclusions. Prof Jon Rhodes, Emeritus Professor of Medicine at the University of Liverpool, says vitamin D has anti-inflammatory effects, and there is some research that suggests it may dampen down the body's immune response to viruses. This could be relevant in very ill coronavirus patients where severe lung damage can result from an inflammatory ""cytokine storm"" in response to the virus, he says, although much more research is needed to explore this. No. Although vitamin D supplements are very safe, taking more than the recommended amount every day can be dangerous in the long run. If you choose to take vitamin D supplements: Higher doses may sometimes be recommended by a doctor for patients with proven vitamin D deficiency. Some people with certain medical conditions, such as kidney problems, cannot safely take vitamin D. Vitamin D supplements are widely available from supermarkets and chemists. They may be just vitamin D or part of a multivitamin tablet. Do not buy more than you need to help keep supplies of supplements available for everyone, say experts. The ingredient listed on the label of most Vitamin D supplements is D3. Vitamin D2 is produced by plants, and Vitamin D3 is the one made by your skin. Vitamin drops are available for babies. Although eating a well-balanced diet can help ensure the normal functioning of the immune system, no individual nutrient, food or supplement is going to ""boost"" it beyond normal levels. It's difficult to get enough vitamin D from food alone. Eating a well-balanced diet is important for good health and is advisable even when people aren't facing a pandemic disease outbreak. It can include vitamin D rich foods such as oily fish and eggs. Some breakfast cereals, margarines and yoghurts are fortified with vitamin D. Although you cannot overdose on vitamin D through exposure to sunlight, strong sun burns skin so you need to balance making vitamin D with being safe in the sun. Take care to cover up or protect your skin with sunscreen to prevent burning and damage. The advice is: The dose for adults (10 micrograms a day) applies to pregnant and breastfeeding women."
25,Coronavirus: Where do governments borrow money?,"How does it work when a government wants to borrow money, and when does it have to pay it back?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 09:35:55 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50504151,"The government has taken wide-ranging steps to try to limit the economic impact of coronavirus. But measures such as the furlough scheme will be expensive. And government income is down because, when people earn and spend less, they don't pay as much income tax and VAT, for example. That means the government will have to borrow a lot more than it expected. The government borrows because it spends more than it receives in revenue, which comes mainly from taxes. It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes - and in some years that has happened. But governments have not always been willing to increase taxes enough to cover their spending, partly for political reasons - it would be unpopular with voters. It's also down to economic reasons - if people have less to spend, it is bad for economic growth and jobs. And in the current crisis, trying to raise more from taxes simply wouldn't work. The amount the government borrows to make up the difference between what it spends and what it collects is known as ""public sector net borrowing"". It is also often referred to as ""the deficit"". New figures show that borrowing in May was £55.2bn, nine times higher than in the same month last year. There used to be some government debt which never had to be repaid, sometimes known as perpetual bonds. But the government chose to repay the last of these in 2015. The big increase in the deficit after the 2008 financial crash was caused by an increase in government spending, and a fall in how much it was receiving in taxes. The government borrows in the financial markets, by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect the repayment. Interest is also paid to whoever owns the bond in the meantime. So it's basically an interest-paying ""IOU"". The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. Private savers also buy some. The appeal to the investors is that UK government bonds are seen as essentially safe - there is no risk that the money won't be paid. You won't lose your money and you know precisely when and how much the payments will be. It varies a lot. Some government borrowing has to be repaid in a month, but some lending is for as long as 30 years. The minimum repayment period is just one day, while some bonds have been issued for 55 years. The deficit is the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends each year. It covers most of this gap by borrowing, or sometimes by selling assets like property. In years when a government spends less than its income, it is known as a surplus. The deficit is not to be confused with debt, although both are linked. Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. So it's a much larger sum. The debt owed by the UK government climbed by £32.1bn to £1,798.5bn between October 2018 and 2019, says the Office for National Statistics. The government does repay debt on the due date, but usually has to borrow new money anyway."
26,Coronavirus: Who should wear a face mask or face covering?,Face coverings are compulsory for people using public transport in England.,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:17:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51205344,"Face coverings on public transport - and for hospital staff, outpatients and visitors - are compulsory in England. This is in line with new World Health Organization (WHO) advice. It says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible. Anyone travelling by bus, train, ferry or plane in England should wear a face covering to help reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission. The new rules coincided with a further easing of lockdown - including the return to class of some secondary school pupils and the reopening of non-essential shops. The number of people using public transport is expected to increase. The government stresses people should: Some passengers will be exempt from the new rules including: If it is ""reasonably necessary"" for you to eat or drink you can remove the face covering to do so. The rules will apply only on public transport - not while waiting - but the rail industry will ask people to cover their face as they enter a station. People could be refused travel if they don't follow the rules. They could also be fined, but this will be the last resort. Public transport excludes cruise ships, school transport, taxis and private hire vehicles. However, ride-sharing company Uber is making face coverings compulsory. In Scotland, it will be compulsory to wear face coverings on all public transport, including buses, planes, ferries and taxis from Monday 22 June. As in England, there are some exemptions. Children under five, people with breathing difficulties, and those with a physical condition which makes it hard to keep a mask in place will not be required to cover their face. Drivers behind a protective shield will be exempt. The Scottish government already recommends wearing a face covering in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops, and has said it will consult on making them mandatory there as well. People in Wales are being asked to wear non-medical face coverings where social distancing is not possible - including public transport. But the government stopped short of making their use mandatory. Similar advice has been given by Northern Ireland's first minister and deputy first minister. The government has been careful to use the term ""face covering"" rather than ""face mask"". Transport Minister Grant Shapps said passengers should wear ""the kind of face covering you can easily make at home"" - with surgical masks kept for medical use. Common household items, such as cotton fabric from old T-shirts or bedding, can be turned into face coverings. The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own. The government has issued its own advice too. All hospital visitors and outpatients in England are being told to wear non-medical face coverings - although no-one will be denied care, and coverings will be provided by hospitals if necessary. NHS England has now lifted its suspension of hospital visiting - but rules are at the discretion of individual trusts. Health staff already wear masks in clinical areas within 2m (6ft) of a patient - but they now have to wear surgical masks at all times, in all areas. The most protective mask for health staff is an FFP3 or, alternatively, an N95 or an FFP2. The WHO has updated its guidelines on face masks - and now recommends non-medical, fabric coverings should be worn by anyone aged under 60 on public transport and in some enclosed work environments. It says they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"" in areas where ""physical distancing of at least one metre is not possible"". The WHO recommends people aged over 60, or anyone of any age with an underlying health condition, should wear a medical-grade mask in those environments. The same goes for anyone with Covid-19 symptoms (even mild) and those caring for them. Healthcare workers should wear medical masks when providing any patient care. Coronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces. Homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms. This is called asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission. Scientists in Singapore suggest the contagion risk is especially high in the 24-48 hours before an infected person is even aware they might have the disease. There is a risk of contamination when taking a face covering on and off - the WHO has issued advice."
27,How many cases are there in your area?,Key graphics explaining how coronavirus has spread in the UK and the government's response.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 14:50:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51768274,"There have been more than 300,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 42,500 people have died, government figures show. However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. Latest figures from the Office For National Statistics (ONS) show that the weekly number of recorded deaths has returned to close to normal levels for the time of year. Death certificates mentioning the virus suggest there had been more than 50,000 deaths by 5 June, according to ONS figures. When looking at deaths over and above the expected number for this time of year, the toll rises to more than 64,000 by the same date. Some of these deaths are likely to include people with undiagnosed coronavirus or those who died as an indirect result of the pandemic. Coronavirus accounted for about 14% of all deaths in the UK in the week to 5 June, according to death registration data - a drop from 18% the previous week. In the week to 17 April, when deaths from the virus reached their peak, this figure was just under 40%.

The new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, was first confirmed in the UK at the end of January, but the number of daily confirmed cases and related deaths only began to increase significantly by the second half of March. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the third highest in the world, after the US and Brazil. However, the government and many experts say it is too soon to make international comparisons. On Saturday, the government announced a further 128 deaths. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with around 38,000 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. In Scotland, the official government figure for deaths is 2,472, but data on death registrations from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) suggests it had reached nearly 4,070 by 14 June. Both sets of figures show the number of new deaths related to coronavirus in Scotland has been declining for seven weeks. In Wales, the death toll stands at 1,476 while Northern Ireland has recorded 545. Last week's figures from the ONS show that while the number of reported deaths in the UK for the week to 5 June rose slightly, it remains close to the normal range for the time of year. The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to. If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as Sage, believes the R number across the whole of the UK is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. The government says England itself is also between 0.7 and 0.9, but slightly higher in the Midlands, where it is between 0.8 and 1.0, and in London and the North West, which are between 0.7 and 1.0. The estimate for Scotland is between 0.6 and 0.8. In Northern Ireland, it is between 0.6 and 0.9, while it is between 0.7 and 1.0 in Wales. The government has said that the R number is one of the most important factors in deciding when lockdown measures can be eased. The number of newly confirmed cases each day has been falling since a peak in April but the seven-day rolling average has begun to level off. New cases have been hovering between 1,000 and 1,500 for several days, with a further 1,295 cases announced on Saturday. The latest ONS estimates suggest that an average of 33,000 people had coronavirus in the community in England, between 31 May and 13 June. This does not include those in hospitals and care homes. However, the UK's coronavirus alert level was downgraded from four to three on Friday, after the country's chief medical officers said there had been a steady decrease in cases in all four nations. Level three means the virus is still in general circulation but there could be a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". The medical officers warned that this ""does not mean that the pandemic is over"" and that ""localised outbreaks are likely to occur"", urging the public to continue to follow safety guidance. On Saturday, the Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told the BBC that a review into the 2m social distancing rule in England will conclude ""within the coming days"". Cases were originally concentrated in London, the Midlands and the North West, but Wales and parts of Scotland and the North East of England have also seen a high proportions of cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has raised the possibility that there could be ""local lockdowns"" in the future to control the spread of the virus. The UK exceeded its target to increase testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. However, the UK Statistics Authority has criticised how the data has been presented, saying the aim appeared to be to show ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he would look at ways the information could be ""improved"". The government announced there were 230,550 tests processed or posted in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Saturday, the highest daily total so far. This figure does not represent the number of people tested, as some are tested more than once. At least two million people have been tested for coronavirus in the UK - but the government has been unable to provide an updated figure for that since 22 May. Most recorded coronavirus deaths have been among the elderly, with NHS England figures showing more than half of deaths have been among people aged over 80. The disease appears to disproportionally affect men in their 50s and 60s, and the death rate for men outstrips women across all age ranges. People with underlying health conditions are also at greater risk regardless of age. Research by Public Health England (PHE) has found that people from ethnic minorities have a much higher risk of dying from coronavirus than people of white British ethnicity. But it is still not clear why - the study did not take into account occupations or obesity, which are also known to be high risk factors. Another study found that South Asian people were the most likely to die from coronavirus after being admitted to hospital. It is the only ethnic group to have a raised risk of death in hospital, which researchers believe is partly due to high levels of diabetes. The study, which involved universities and public health bodies across the UK, says ethnicity may now need to be considered alongside age and other health issues when deciding who gets a vaccine, if one becomes available. The most deprived parts of England and Wales have been hit twice as hard by coronavirus as wealthier areas, according to the ONS. Urban areas were worse-affected than rural areas and London had significantly more deaths from coronavirus per 100,000 people than any other region, when standardised for age.

28,Coronavirus: How does the Covid-19 alert level system work?,"The threat of Covid-19 in England is being ranked through a five-level, colour-coded alert system.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 11:15:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52634739,"The UK's coronavirus alert level has been downgraded from four to three. The virus is now said to be in general circulation, but not high or rising quickly. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. The government unveiled the system on 11 May. The prime minister said it would help decide how tough social-distancing measures should be. There are five levels: The alert level was reduced from level four to three on 19 June. That means the epidemic is in general circulation but transmission is no longer ""high or rising exponentially"". Announcing the change, the chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said: ""There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, and this continues. It does not mean that the pandemic is over. The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur."" Level three is associated with a ""gradual relaxation of restrictions"". It's the first time the alert level has changed since its creation on 10 May. In time, the government hopes, the level will reflect the threat in specific areas of England and be used to determine local restrictions. The Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) - set up by the government in May - has the task of recommending what the alert level should be. JBC scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data. The JBC also has an ""insight team"" which monitors local spikes of Covid-19 and advises health officials and local authorities. Their recommendations are then reviewed and agreed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations. Not automatically. The Covid-19 alert level system is separate and independent from any government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions. In England, those decisions are determined by the government's five tests. However, he alert level system is used by the UK governments to help their decisions on the continuing easing of lockdown."
29,Coronavirus: Which schools are reopening for pupils?,"Which children are going back to school, and what about the rest?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 09:05:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-51643556,"Some pupils in England have started to return to the classroom, as the coronavirus lockdown is eased. But when will schools fully reopen and how will pupils catch up with lost learning? During lockdown, many schools have offered a limited curriculum online - relying on parents and guardians to supervise work. Despite this, around a third of pupils are not engaging with the work they've been set, a survey of 3,000 leaders and teachers in England's state schools suggested. To help pupils in England catch up, the government has announced a £1bn fund. Of this, £650m will be available to head teachers to provide tutoring sessions for small groups of primary and secondary pupils. The remaining £350m will be spent on a national tutoring programme aimed at the most disadvantaged pupils. To further support home learning, the BBC expanded its Bitesize website, which offers daily online lessons in English, maths and other core subjects. Secondary schools in England have been allowed to reopen for Years 10 and 12 since 15 June. Teaching of vulnerable children and those of critical workers in all year groups will continue. But only a quarter of eligible pupils are allowed in school at any one time. Students who do return are encouraged to travel separately and avoid public transport. Health Secretary Matt Hancock conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Plans to get all primary pupils in England back for four weeks before the summer holidays have been dropped. But some nursery and pre-school children - plus pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 - started to go back on 1 June. Not all schools have reopened, some due to local council advice and some because they don't have the staff or space to safely accommodate pupils. Some parents have chosen not to send their children back. On 11 June, 868,000 children in England - or 9.1% - are estimated to have been in classes. Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June to all age groups - but only a third of pupils will be in classes at any one time. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing their return. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Plans in England include keeping classroom doors and windows open to encourage air flow, and introducing one-way systems around school buildings. Here are seven other things that could be different: If any pupils or staff - or anyone they live with - develop coronavirus symptoms, they will be asked to stay away from school. The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is ""very, very small, but not zero"", according to sources in the government's scientific advisory group, Sage. The group has published documents about the safety and impact of reopening English schools, which also say teachers would not be at above-average risk compared with other occupations. Teachers' unions have warned it is not safe to allow more children into primary schools. The government acknowledges some schools are not ready to open, but says the necessary five tests for easing the lockdown in England have been met. in England, 21 May 244,000(approximate) 8,819,765on a normal school day It is not currently compulsory to send children to school. This temporary arrangement - where usual sanctions do not apply - is expected to continue in England during the summer term. Summer exams have been cancelled in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. This includes GCSEs and A-levels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus primary school Sats national curriculum tests in England. In Scotland, Highers and Nationals will not be going ahead. The Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says exams will take place in 2021 in England. ""We are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach to this,"" he told MPs. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?

30,Coronavirus: Should I go to university this year?,"Will students have online or face-to-face learning this autumn, and will they still have to pay full fees?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 08:21:39 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52753913,"The deadline for students to decide whether or not to accept university offers for the new academic year passed on Thursday. It was a big decision - even more so this year, with many lectures due to take place online and socialising difficult. There are 137 universities in the UK, and 89 out of 92 of them which replied to a Universities UK survey will provide some in-person teaching next term, This will be part of a so-called ""blended approach"" to teaching and learning, with many universities announcing that lectures will be given online. You need to contact individual universities or check their websites to find out what they have decided. The deadline to decide on whether to accept offers was pushed back to Thursday. You had to make two choices - a firm first-choice university and an insurance, or back-up one, and then decline any other offers. If you meet the offer conditions of the first choice, you are in - otherwise the back-up alternative comes into play. Even then, you are not committed to going if you choose not to. Places at specific universities can be cancelled online, and if you decide not to go to university at all, you must phone the ones holding you a place to ask for your application to be withdrawn. None of this will leave you out of pocket. The government says university students in England will still have to pay full tuition fees even if their courses are taught online in the autumn. However, some students are unhappy about this. One started a petition, demanding a refund for lost teaching, after face-to-face teaching ended in March. It gained more than 330,000 signatures, enough for a parliamentary debate. The maximum UK university tuition fee is £9,250 a year, which is totally covered by a student loan, although international students may pay more. Scottish and European Union students pay no tuition fees for attending a university in Scotland. Accommodation costs can vary, but usually run into several thousand pounds. Maintenance loans for living costs are means-tested, so you have to make up the difference, which often means falling back on parents. Claire Sosienski-Smith, a National Union of Students (NUS) official, told the BBC: ""We would recommend that students think carefully before signing any binding contracts or agreements for next year, especially in the case of rental contracts."" Some students had their accommodation fees removed for the cancelled summer term, but others had to pay, even though they were unable to stay at university because of the lockdown.  2.38 millionstudents in UK higher education 1.8 millionof them undergraduates 480,000students from outside the UK 541,240became undergraduates in 2019 The numbers of students in UK universities could be much lower than usual from September. A survey by the University and College Union found that more than one in five students could defer going to university this year. Universities and colleges take varied approaches to the issue. Some will not allow deferred entry for subjects such as medicine, but will consider it for other courses. However, you need to check that the same course is being offered the following year. You could also be asked your reasons for wanting to defer when your application is considered. A recent study revealed that two-thirds of international students still intend to take up their offers abroad, including in the UK. IDP Connect, which works in global marketing for students, surveyed nearly 6,900 students and found that 69% of them were not changing their plans. However, prospective postgraduate students from East Asia largely prefer a face-to-face start in January to an online one in the autumn, according to a British Council study. The survey of more than 15,000 students, carried out in April and May, also showed that UK universities are likely to have nearly 14,000 fewer new enrolments in 2020-21, compared to 2018-19. This would lead to a drop of £463m in spending on tuition and living expenses. A plea from universities in England for a £2bn bailout from the government was rejected. However, to help with cashflow, £2.6bn of tuition fee income and £100m of research funding will be brought forward. The universities can also access the Treasury's support for businesses disrupted by coronavirus, worth another £700m. The number of new UK and EU students is going to be controlled by the government, which may add extra numbers in some cases. Half of any additional capacity would be given to people studying courses like nursing. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
31,Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation rules?,Lockdown rules are changing to help single people cut off from family and friends.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:07:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,"Lockdown restrictions are easing, with changes aimed at reducing loneliness among people who live alone. Each of the four UK nations has different rules. So what can you do now? In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents with children under 18 - can form an ""exclusive"" support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size - but nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They will not have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can stay overnight. It means, for example, that a single grandparent could pair up with one of their children's households. An adult living alone could mix with their parents, or two single friends living apart could get together. If anyone in the bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in both households must self-isolate. If you don't live on your own, or live with a child or children aged over 18, then you can't form a bubble. Wales is considering introducing a similar scheme. In England, groups of up to six people from different households can gather outside, in parks or private gardens. In Scotland,  three separate households - up to a recommended maximum of eight people - can now meet outdoors. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can meet each other outside. As in Scotland, families should aim to travel no more than five miles, but some longer journeys will be allowed from 22 June on compassionate grounds. Beauty spots remain closed until 6 July. In Northern Ireland, groups of up to six people who do not live together can meet outdoors. In all countries, children are included in the headcount and social distancing guidelines - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from each other - apply. People in England can exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from two households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside. So having a kickabout with a football in the park is allowed in both countries, as long as people stay 2m (6ft) apart. However, full games with someone from outside your household are still not allowed because of the physical contact involved. Small groups of sports teams can also resume fitness sessions. Individual sports permitted in England, with social distancing, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Golf can be enjoyed everywhere. From 22 June, non-professional elite athletes can resume training, and restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports in Wales. From 29 June, outdoor playgrounds and sports courts will open in Scotland. People with certain underlying health conditions, or who are pregnant or aged over 70, are deemed to be clinically vulnerable. If you are in this category, you are advised to stay at home as much as possible. Another group, of about 2.5 million people, is categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable. This group had been strongly advised to stay at home at all times and avoid face-to-face contact - so called ""shielding"". Now those people in England and Wales are being told they can spend some time outdoors again - either with members of their household, or by meeting someone else at a social distance. People shielding in Scotland have also been told they can now spend time outdoors for exercise, either alone or with people from one other household in groups of no more than eight. Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or can cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, and then touch your face with unwashed hands. Virus transmission is less likely when ''fresh'' air is involved - usually when people are outside. If you show symptoms of coronavirus - such as a dry cough, high temperature or loss of taste - you must take extra precautions. You should self-isolate - stay at home and not leave it for any reason. Ask others to drop off food and medicines. If England's NHS Test and Trace team contact you because you've been close to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, you must self-isolate for up to 14 days - even if you feel fine. The people you live with don't have to self-isolate, but must take extra care regarding social distancing and hand washing. There are similar tracing systems in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes.

32,Coronavirus pandemic: Tracking the global outbreak,Key maps and charts explaining how the respiratory virus has spread around the world and how it is being dealt with.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:29:59 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-51235105,"Coronavirus is continuing its spread across the world, with more than 8.5 million confirmed cases in 188 countries. More than 460,000 people have lost their lives. This series of maps and charts tracks the global outbreak of the virus. While some countries are starting to see confirmed cases and deaths fall following strict lockdown restrictions, others are still seeing figures rise. A sharp increase in cases in Latin America in the second half of May led the WHO to say the Americas were the new centre of the pandemic. But there have also been new spikes in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. These charts show four countries - Brazil, Mexico, India and Pakistan - where cases (in blue) and deaths (in red) have been on an upward trajectory, as shown by the blue and red lines. Brazil, Peru, Chile, Mexico and Ecuador are among the Latin America countries that have seen widespread outbreaks. On Saturday Brazil became the second country in the world, after the US, to confirm more than one million cases of Covid-19. President Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the risks of the virus and prioritised the economy in his decision-making. Also on Saturday, Mexico City delayed a planned reopening of businesses by a week, as cases continued to surge nationwide. Elsewhere, the number of daily deaths in India jumped to more than 2,000 on Wednesday after previously unrecorded deaths were added by officials in Delhi and Maharashtra. Neighbouring Pakistan has also seen its number of infections and deaths rise in recent weeks and the healthcare systems in both countries are under strain. In Iran, there are fears of a second wave of infections. The number of daily deaths has risen to around 100 per day for the first time in two months. China is also dealing with dozens of new cases believed to be connected a Beijing wholesale market, and has imposed lockdown measures on several neighbourhoods.  Chinese officials say the virus currently being detected in Beijing is a ""European strain"". South Africa and Egypt have seen the largest outbreaks so far in Africa. But testing rates are reported to be extremely low in some parts of the continent so this could be distorting understanding of how far the virus has spread. The virus, which causes the respiratory infection Covid-19, was first detected in the city of Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It then spread quickly across the globe in the first months of 2020.

US figures do not include Puerto Rico, Guam or the US Virgin Islands. The US has by far the largest number of cases - now more than 2.2 million and around 25% of the global total - according to figures collated by Johns Hopkins University. It also has the world's highest death toll, followed by Brazil and the UK. In China, the official death toll is some 4,600 from about 84,000 confirmed cases, although critics have questioned whether the country's official numbers can be trusted. Globally, the true number of cases is thought to be much higher than the reported figures, as many of those with milder symptoms have not been tested and counted. In the table below, countries can be reordered by deaths, death rate and total cases.

Source: Johns Hopkins University, national public health agencies and UN population data Figures last updated: 20 June 2020, 10:03 BST The outbreak was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March. This is when an infectious disease is passing easily from person to person in many parts of the world at the same time. The WHO has warned that the pandemic is a long way from being over and says people should be prepared for new outbreaks, especially in areas where lockdowns are eased.  Globally, at least 4.5 billion people - half the world's population - were living under social distancing measures at the height of the pandemic in Europe, according to the AFP news agency's estimates. Those restrictions have had a big impact on the global economy, with the International Monetary Fund warning the world faces the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The United Nations World Food Programme has also warned that the pandemic could almost double the number of people suffering acute hunger. In Europe, the UK, Italy, Spain and France, along with others, now appear to have passed the peak, with the number of new confirmed cases and deaths falling. The UK has reported more than 42,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest number in Europe. Italy has the second highest death toll with about 34,000, while both France and Spain are just below 30,000. However, differences in population size and how countries report their figures, with some including deaths in care homes, or deaths of those suspected but not confirmed of having the virus, means international comparisons are complicated. Having been on lockdown to control the spread of the virus, European countries are now beginning to ease restrictions. How and when restrictions are lifted varies from country to country, but the WHO has urged all nations to adopt a ""slow, steady"" approach. The risk of a second wave of infections requiring European countries to re-impose full lockdowns is moderate to high, according to the EU agency that monitors infectious diseases. With more than 2.2 million cases, the US has the highest number of confirmed infections in the world. It has also recorded nearly 120,000 deaths. The state of New York has been particularly badly affected, with more than 31,000 deaths in total, but the number of daily deaths has remained below 100 since late May - down from 1,000 a day in early April. At one point, more than 90% of the US population was under mandatory lockdown orders, but most states have now loosened their stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some businesses to reopen - a move health officials fear could further spread the virus. Nationally, the number of new cases has remained steady at around 20,000 a day for several weeks, but the situation is not the same in every state. California, Texas, Arizona and Florida are among states reporting consistent increases in case counts. President Trump and Vice President Pence have cast the increases as largely a product of an uptick in US testing capacity. But infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has warned that higher percentages of positive tests in some states ""cannot be explained by increased testing."" On Friday, Oklahoma's Supreme Court ruled that a rally by President Trump, due to be held on Saturday, could go ahead. The court rejected a lawsuit to stop the event over concerns that it could increase the spread of Covid-19. US government figures published on Thursday showed more than 29 million people - nearly one in five American workers - continued to collect jobless benefits as of 30 May. The economic downturn in the US has been officially declared a recession."
33,How does breakthrough coronavirus drug work?,A cheap steroid is hailed a big breakthrough in the treatment of seriously ill Covid-19 patients.,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:52:00 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-53077879,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells. Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from £5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"". Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. ""It's been a huge ongoing debate,"" says Prof Horby. Scientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients with some promising early results.

34,Could creating billions of pounds save your job?,The Bank of England has unveiled new measures to stimulate the economy. How do they work?,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:33:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789,"The coronavirus pandemic has been a massive blow to the economy, hitting jobs and businesses hard. The Bank of England is to pump £100bn into the UK economy to help it recover, in another round of ""quantitative easing"". When economic times are hard, people worry about losing their jobs, and grow wary about spending money. Businesses see their customers staying away. They start losing money, and may have to lay off workers. Normally, the Bank of England would try to make things better by cutting interest rates. Lower rates mean you get less interest on your savings, so it's less attractive to save money than to spend it. And lower interest rates make it cheaper to borrow money, so it's easier to buy a new house, or car, or expand your business. People buying things and businesses investing helps the economy stay healthy, protecting jobs. But interest rates are currently just above zero - there's no scope for another big cut. That's why the Bank does quantitative easing (QE). It's another way to encourage spending and investment. The Bank of England is in charge of the UK's money supply - how much money is in circulation in the economy. That means it can create new money electronically. That's why QE is sometimes described as ""printing money"", but in fact no new physical bank notes are created. The Bank spends most of this money buying government bonds. Government bonds are a type of investment where you lend money to the government. In return, it promises to pay back a certain sum of money in the future, as well as interest in the meantime. Buying billions of pounds' worth of bonds pushes the price up: when demand for anything increases, the price usually goes up too. Many loan interest rates offered by banks to businesses and individuals are affected by the price of government bonds. So if those government bond prices go up, the interest rates on those loans should go down - making it easier for people to borrow and spend money. In addition, many investors buy government bonds in times of crisis, as a safe place to put their money, because the UK government has never failed to repay a bond. If the Bank of England drives the price of those bonds up, that safety becomes more expensive. So those investors may be encouraged to buy shares or lend money to businesses again instead - both of which will help to support the economy. The first QE programme in the UK was launched in 2009 when the financial crisis was threatening the economy, unemployment was rising and the stock markets were in freefall. The Bank of England had already cut rates from 5% to 1%, but it thought the economy needed more support. So on 5 March, it cut rates to 0.5% and announced a £75bn programme of quantitative easing. That figure has since risen to £745bn, as the Bank launched new rounds of QE after the Eurozone debt crisis, the Brexit referendum and the coronavirus pandemic. A number of other countries started QE programmes after 2009, including the US, the Eurozone and Japan. Most research suggests that QE helped to keep economic growth stronger, wages higher, and unemployment lower than they would otherwise have been. However, QE does have some complicated consequences. As well as bonds, it increases the prices of things like shares and property. This tends to benefit wealthier members of society who already own these things, as the Bank itself concluded in 2012. Meanwhile, younger people found it harder to buy their first homes and build up savings. Another important side effect of QE hit pensions funds. Government bond prices are used to estimate how much it will cost to provide pensions in the future. If those bond prices go up, the cost of providing future pensions rises. As a result many firms were obliged to make bigger payments into their pension schemes, reducing money available to invest elsewhere. And in many cases, QE will have contributed to the decision to close pension schemes altogether. More than 30% of the national debt has been bought by the Bank of England through QE. Having a reliable buyer with extremely deep pockets makes it easier for the government to raise more money by selling bonds. That will give it more scope to borrow for other measures to tackle the economic effects of the pandemic, from furlough schemes to extra money for the NHS and support for businesses. The government also pays much less interest on bonds owned by the Bank of England than other lenders - which takes further pressure off the public finances.

Home Secretary Priti Patel said the move is to protect public health, because imported coronavirus cases ''pose a more significant threat''. Passengers arriving in the UK by plane, ferry or train - including UK nationals - will be asked to provide an address where they will self-isolate for 14 days. Travellers can be fined £100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. Surprise visits will be used to check they are following the rules. Those in England could be fined up to £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate. Passengers should drive their own car to their destination, where possible. If they don't provide an address, the government will arrange accommodation at the traveller's expense. Once at their destination they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. People returning from overseas will not be automatically eligible for statutory sick pay unless they meet the required conditions - for example displaying coronavirus symptoms. Anyone arriving from the Common Travel Area (CTA) - the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands, or the Isle of Man - will not have to enter quarantine, as long as they have been in the CTA for at least 14 days. The government has also said it is looking into international travel corridors or ""air bridges"" to countries with low infection rates and strong healthcare systems. It hopes this could avoid the need for quarantine for travellers between the two. Negotiations are already taking place between the UK and Portugal. However, the government is currently advising against all non-essential travel abroad, and hasn't given a date for when quarantine will end. The measures will be reviewed in late June, three weeks after their introduction, to check they remain ''effective and necessary''. There are a number of groups who are exempt, including: Travellers could find they also have to enter quarantine when they arrive in another country. Some have introduced screening measures such as temperature checks, and entry restrictions. Quarantine has not been welcomed by the UK's travel industry. Airlines UK, which represents various airlines, said quarantine ""would effectively kill off air travel"". British Airways, EasyJet and Ryanair have launched a legal challenge against the policy. The British Ports Association, which represents ferry companies, has also spoken out against the measures - calling them ""overzealous"". EasyJet has restarted a limited number of flights to European destinations, with all passengers and cabin crew told to wear face masks. Ryanair plans to reintroduce 40% of its flights from 1 July, subject to travel restrictions being lifted and safety measures being brought in at airports. British Airways is reviewing its plans to run 50% of its schedule from July, because of the quarantine rules. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? Are you planning to travel to or from the UK?

36,Lockdown update: All you need to know about new measures,How will social and work life be different after the easing of some restrictions around the UK?,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 15:35:58 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52530518,"Lockdown measures are being eased further after more than two months of restrictions. But how is everyday life changing? In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, households containing one person, or one adult and children under 18, can form a ''support bubble'' with one other household. The second household can contain any number of people. In England and Northern Ireland, people can already meet outside in groups of up to six people from different households. In Scotland, people from up to three different households can now meet up outdoors if they maintain social distancing, up to a maximum group size of eight. In Wales, any number of people from two different households can now meet outdoors. Groups of up to six people who are not in the same household can meet while socially-distancing outdoors in Northern Ireland, although up to 10 people can now attend outdoor weddings and civil partnerships. In all four nations, permitted numbers of people includes children, and social distancing - remaining 2m (6ft) apart from others - should be followed unless those people are part of the same household or support bubble.  The rules are different for people who are shielding. The overall advice remains ""stay at home"" as much as possible. But some non-contact outdoor sport is allowed - although rules vary across the UK. People in England can now exercise outside with up to five others from different households. In Scotland, people from three households, in groups of up to eight people, can exercise outside together. Individual sports permitted in England, with social distancing, include athletics, golf, horse riding and tennis, where doubles is also allowed with someone from outside your household. Tennis can also be played in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Golf can be enjoyed everywhere. Households can also drive any distance in England to destinations such as parks and beaches. But they should not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Decisions on easing lockdown in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are the responsibility of each national government. In Scotland, a ban on travelling more than five miles to meet family and friends has been lifted, but it remains in place for leisure and recreation activities. A five-mile restriction on travel remains in place in Wales, although the government says this will be lifted on 6 July, if conditions allow. Wales will also decide on 9 July on whether to open up the country to tourists again, from 13 July. The Scottish government has said that hotels and tourist accommodation may be able to reopen from 15 July if its next review of lockdown restrictions on 9 July also decides that conditions are favourable. Self-catering holiday accommodation will reopen in Northern Ireland from 26 June, and hotels will follow a week later on 3 July. Most people entering the UK - including British citizens - now have to self-isolate for 14 days. The Foreign Office currently advises against all but essential journeys, and all passengers are advised to remain 2m (6ft) apart wherever possible. All passengers in England and Scotland have been told they must wear face coverings on public transport, including planes, and some airports have also made it compulsory. People who can work from home in England should continue to do so ""for the foreseeable future"". People who must travel to their workplace are encouraged to walk, cycle or drive if possible, to prevent overcrowding on public transport, on which they are likely to face social-distance queuing. Wearing a face covering on public transport is mandatory in England and Scotland. Read the government advice in Wales and Northern Ireland. Workplaces should be made safe for staff, with more cleaning, staggered working shifts and, for office workers, no hot-desking. If you're a cleaner or plumber, and need to enter someone else's home for your job, you are allowed to return to work. No work should be carried out in the home of someone shielding or isolating because of Covid-19 symptoms, unless it's a household emergency. In homes where someone is clinically vulnerable - for example, where a person is aged over 70 - face-to-face contact should be avoided, and strict hygiene rules followed. People in England and Wales who have been asked to stay home and shield - because they have health conditions that make them particularly vulnerable - can now they can spend some time outdoors again - either with members of their household, or by meeting someone else at a social distance. People shielding in Scotland have also been told they can now spend time outdoors for exercise, either alone or with people from one other household in groups of no more than eight. People who are shielding in Northern Ireland can now go outdoors. Childminders and nannies in England can return to work - and the government has issued fresh guidance. In Scotland, childminders are also now able to welcome children back into their homes. Read the guidance for childcare providers from the Welsh government here - and from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Some primary schools in England have reopened for some children - with Wales announcing a return for all ages of pupils at the end of June. Exact rules vary, but head teachers and local councils have been working out how best to minimise risks for pupils, staff and parents. Strict hygiene and social distancing is being enforced - including smaller class sizes, staggered breaks and frequent hand washing. However, the government's plan for all primary school years in England to go back to class for the final four weeks of the summer term has now been dropped. Instead, schools will be given ""flexibility"" over whether or not to admit more pupils. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish schools will reopen at the start of the autumn term on 11 August, using a blended model, with some continued home-learning. Some Northern Irish pupils preparing for exams and those about to move to post-primary schools will go back in late August, with a phased return for the rest in September. Secondary schools and further education colleges in England now have limited face-to-face contact with Year 10 and 12 pupils who have key exams next year, in addition to their ""continued remote, home learning"". However, the government has now conceded that England's secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Meanwhile, there is uncertainty over whether students will be able to go to university in person in September or whether they will be taught partially or completely online. All non-essential retailers - from department stores to small independent shops - are now able to open, if they put in place social distancing measures. And outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen if they are ""Covid-secure"". Garden centres are now open again across the UK. DIY chains - some of which stayed open throughout the lockdown - have also reopened many of their shops. Zoos, safari parks, and other outdoor attractions are now reopening in England. Places of worship are allowed to reopen for private prayer although not for services or events. Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not open before 4 July at the earliest in England. However, indoor public spaces such as beauty salons, where social distancing may be difficult, could reopen ''significantly later"", depending on when the rate of infection goes down.

37,Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work?,People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced.,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 13:35:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52442754,"People who have been in close contact with someone found to have Covid-19 are now being traced. NHS contact tracers will ask people they get in touch with to self-isolate for a fortnight. But plans for a tracing app have been delayed until winter at the earliest. If you develop coronavirus symptoms and test positive for the disease, you'll be contacted by text, email or phone and asked to log on to the NHS Test and Trace website. There you will be asked for personal information including: Close contacts are: Contact must have taken place within a nine-day period, starting 48 hours before symptoms appeared. No-one contacted as a result of you testing positive for coronavirus will be told your identity. A parent or guardian will need to give permission for a call with under-18s to continue. The scheme - which the prime minister claimed would be ""world-beating"" - was launched on 28 May. According to figures released on 18 June: The government also planned to launch a tracing app, which would automatically alert users if they had been in contact with another user with coronavirus. Several other countries have introduced contact-tracing apps: Northern Ireland was the first of the four UK administrations to bring in contact tracing, which is being carried out exclusively by telephone at the moment. Scotland's system is called NHS Test and Protect, and has recruited 2,000 contact tracers. It was launched as the easing of lockdown restrictions began. In Wales, the ''test, trace, protect'' system launched on 1 June. Anyone deemed at risk of infection will be told to stay at home for 14 days from the point where they had contact with the person who tested positive. You will be asked to self-isolate, even if you do not have symptoms, to stop the danger of the virus spreading. You should not leave your home for any reason. If you need food or medicine and live alone, you should order it online or by phone, or ask friends and family to drop it off on your doorstep. If you live with other people they won't have to self-isolate, unless they also develop symptoms, but they must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. The NHS Test and Trace service will only be calling from 0300 0135 000. They will not ask you: It's currently voluntary. But the Department for Health has said that if people don't comply, ""we will not hesitate to introduce tougher measures - for example making visits to check they're home, or issuing fines if they are found outside the house"". If people can't work from home, the government says employers must ensure any self-isolating employee is receiving sick pay and give them the option to use their paid leave days if they prefer."
38,Coronavirus: Who should be shielding?,People at risk of becoming severely ill if they get coronavirus should take extra precautions.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 15:03:48 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51997151,"About 2.5 million people most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home. This ""shielding"" is to protect lives. While everyone is being advised to keep their distance from other people to help stop the spread of coronavirus, some people with underlying health conditions need to take even more precautions to protect themselves. The virus poses a high risk if someone who is shielding is exposed to it. The guidance on shielding is being kept under review. Infection levels in the community are now falling so the risk of exposure is significantly less than it has been. People who are shielding in England and Northern Ireland are able to spend some time outdoors, as long as they continue to follow social distancing rules. It means those with families can go out once a day with members of their household. People living alone can meet someone from another household while keeping 2m (6ft) apart. People shielding in Scotland and Wales have been told they can also now spend time outdoors for exercise, either on their own, with their family or with people from another household. In Northern Ireland, the shielding advice is set to be paused from 31 July. After that date people will no longer need to shield but should take particular care when outside and strictly maintain social distancing. Those most at risk, who include: While it is true that the risk from coronavirus goes up with age, more than half of those shielding are under the age of 70, say officials. More than 90,000 are children. Anyone in this highest-risk category who has not yet received a letter from the NHS or been contacted by their doctor should get in touch with their GP or hospital doctor by phone or online. This does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to practise social distancing. Experts strongly advise people with serious underlying health conditions to follow the advice. If this applies to you, shielding is for your personal protection - it is your choice to decide whether to follow the recommendations. You could call your doctor to discuss this. It means staying at home and following the guidelines. You should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. You should avoid any face-to-face contact, so that means no visitors. Visits from people who provide you with essential healthcare and personal support are fine. Carers and care workers should stay away if they have any of the symptoms of coronavirus, and anyone coming into your home should keep their hands clean by washing them with soap and water. They do not need to shield themselves but must make sure they follow recommendations to shield you. They should also stringently follow the guidance on social distancing. They should also keep some physical distance (2m) from you and keep to a minimum the time spent in shared spaces such as the kitchen, bathroom and lounge. Shared spaces should be kept well ventilated - open a window. If you can, use a separate bathroom and bedroom from the rest of the household, and also make sure you use separate towels. If you share a toilet and bathroom, make sure they are cleaned after every use. Consider drawing up a rota for bathing, with you using the facilities first. Use the kitchen when others are not in there and take your meals back to your room to eat. Coronavirus is spread through droplets (from coughs and sneezes), so do not share cutlery or crockery unless it is clean. Use a dishwasher if you have one. Soap or washing-up liquid and water gets rid of the virus too. Keep surfaces that are frequently touched - door handles, taps and handrails - clean. People in England can register to get essential food and medicine supplies if friends or family cannot help. Similar support is available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The ultimate ambition is to be able to control the virus enough so that people can move out of shielding. A vaccine could help enable this. These are symptoms of coronavirus. It does not mean that you definitely have it, but you should contact the NHS 111 online coronavirus service, or call NHS 111 or your doctor. Do this as soon as you get symptoms. Do not visit the GP, pharmacy, urgent care centre or hospital. In an emergency, call 999 if you are seriously ill. Good hygiene can stop the virus spreading: Keep physically active. Look after your mental wellbeing. Stay in touch with friends on the phone, by post or online. Prepare a hospital bag just in case. This should include your emergency contact, a list of medicines you take and any information on your planned care appointments, as well as things you would need for an overnight stay, such as a toothbrush and pyjamas."
39,Coronavirus: Do I have to go back to work after lockdown?,"With lockdown restrictions eased, people are starting to go back to work. But what are your rights?","Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:22:07 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52567567,"With many shops in England starting to reopen, the number of people back at work is growing. Cafes, restaurants and pubs could follow as soon as 4 July. Many people fear contracting coronavirus once they return to work. So, what are your rights? Employees who can work from home are advised by the government to continue to do so. For those who do return, full government guidance on working safely has been issued for everywhere from building sites to offices and shops. It includes separate advice for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Firms should be ready to ""move quickly"" if the rules change, says the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development. That means employees might have little notice if their company wants them to get back to work. This may soon become an issue for workers in the hospitality sector, says employment law expert Simon Rice-Birchall from Eversheds Sutherland. After all, these are public-facing jobs and potentially carry a higher risk of catching the virus. Mr Rice-Birchall says that if people do not show up for work when asked, they should not expect to get paid. However, employers should be ""extremely careful"" about deciding to discipline or sack them. Under employment law, workers have the right to walk off the job to protect themselves from ""serious and imminent"" danger, he says. Firms may think they are enforcing social distancing rules, but ""no employer can police a workplace properly,"" he adds. There are 1.5 million people in England classified as being at high-risk, including those who have received organ transplants or are on immunosuppression drugs. Employers must be ""especially careful"" to protect such people, says Tom Neil, senior adviser at arbitration service Acas. This may include varying their responsibilities, or keeping them on furlough until it is safer for them to return. ""Particularly strict"" social distancing rules should be in place to protect those who do return, says Mr Neil. Employers must follow a strict code of measures, which can include: If employees are unhappy and their employer has not addressed their concerns, they should contact their local authority or the Health and Safety Executive, who can force firms to take action. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) says companies should publish risk assessments, so employees know what safety measures are being taken. However, it says that not all firms have done so. ""Employers who fail to keep their workers safe must be fined - and if necessary, shut down, "" says TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady. Many people are afraid that using public transport will expose them to the risk of being infected by coronavirus. Employers are being encouraged to stagger working times, so workers can avoid rush hour. They are being asked to consider parking and bike storage for people who want to drive or cycle. Acas says employers should discuss with returning staff how they will travel to and from work and offer help. At least seven out of 10 UK firms have reported furloughing workers. From July, businesses will be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. But when the scheme finishes at the end of October, companies may not be able to pay all their workers and could cut jobs. Companies don't have to keep on employees when furlough ends and cannot use these payments to subsidise redundancy packages. But employers could face allegations of discrimination if they only keep on staff who worked through the crisis, says Acas. People with underlying health conditions might be more likely to go on furlough, while the woman in a household is more likely to be the one that stays at home with the children. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that if schools are not open and workers cannot get childcare, employers should not expect staff to return. While it is not necessarily legal protection if you refuse to go to work, Mr Johnson said parents and guardians who are unable to return ""must be defended and protected on that basis""."
40,Has a second wave of infections hit Iran?,"Iran was one of the worst affected countries early on, so is the virus flaring up again?","Mon, 15 Jun 2020 11:56:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52959756,"Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, sparking fears it might be facing a second wave of the pandemic. Iran started to relax its restrictions in mid-April, after the number of infections declined, so is it paying the price? New reported infections averaged more than 3,000 a day in the first week of June - a 50% increase on the previous seven days. The figure reached a high of 3,574 on 4 June, before dropping slightly. The previous highest figure was 3,186 on 30 March - during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst affected countries outside China. At that time, the Iranian authorities were criticised for their hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites in the Shia holy city of Qom and for not moving quicker to restrict movement. Then, in April, as the number of reported cases dropped to below 1,000 a day, Iran began to ease its restrictions: City transport systems across Iran, as well as banks and offices, have been packed with people. The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq. There is clearly more social interaction with the easing of restrictions - but officials have suggested the surge in new cases could be down to more testing. President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases. Iran's chief epidemiologist at the country's health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: ""The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms."" It currently does one test for every 79 people, which is up from about one test for every 380 two months ago. However, when you look at the proportion of these tests that are positive, there is a clear upward trend since the middle and end of May after it dropped sharply in April. On 29 May, just under 11% of tests were positive - but by 6 June that figure had risen to over 14%. Health officials have also pointed out the number of daily deaths recorded has been below 100 since mid-April. The daily figure was between 30 and 90 for most of May, but on 14 June it went above 100. This was the first time it had done so in two months. It would take several weeks after the initial rise in infections for an increasing trend in recorded deaths to become apparent. And a report by the Iranian parliament's research centre, published in April, suggested the real death toll could be twice as high as the official number, which comprises deaths in hospitals only. Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. ""People have become completely careless regarding this disease,"" he told the Iranian news agency. ""If our people fail to respect the health protocols... we must prepare ourselves for the worst situation."" And a health ministry poll last week suggested only: What options do the authorities have? President Rouhani has warned restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the outbreak worsens. But the leadership in Tehran does not want to talk about a ""second wave"", even though some officials in other parts of Iran have been warning of one, according to BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour. And she adds that it cannot afford to continue restrictions, because of the state of the economy, which faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. ""To contain the virus, you need a lockdown,"" says Rana Rahimpour, ""and in a lockdown, you need to be able to pay people."" Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter"
41,Coronavirus: What's happening to free school meals this summer?,The government in England will now provide free school meals vouchers over the summer holidays.,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:38:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53053337,"The government in England has agreed to extend a voucher scheme for children on free school meals during the summer holidays, following a campaign by footballer Marcus Rashford and others. It had previously insisted the scheme would finish at the end of the summer term.  Scotland and Wales will also continue with the voucher programme. So, who is eligible for free school meals and how do they work? Free school meals have been at least partially funded by the government for more than a century, because of concerns about malnourishment and children being too hungry to concentrate during lessons. Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible, from government-maintained nurseries through to sixth forms. Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. New claims made from April 2018 in England must come from households earning a maximum income of £7,400 a year after tax, not including any benefits. It's the same in Scotland and Wales, but in Northern Ireland the household income threshold is £14,000 In England and Scotland, all infant state school pupils (those in Reception and in Years 1 and 2) can get free school meals during term time. If a child qualifies for school meals they remain eligible until they finish the phase of school they're in as of 31 March 2022, whether primary or secondary. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019, or about 15% of state-educated pupils. In Manchester, where Marcus Rashford grew up, the figure is 28.1% The take-up was greatest in parts of London, the north of England and the Midlands where between a quarter and a third of all pupils were receiving free school meals. The majority of children have not been at school during the coronavirus pandemic. This has prompted concerns that those eligible for free school meals could ""fall through the cracks"" and go hungry. In recent years, free school meals have been linked to lowering obesity levels, and boosting academic achievement for poorer pupils. During term time, the government in England expects schools to support pupils eligible for free school meals through an alternative scheme, such as: Many families have been issued with either an electronic voucher or gift card worth £15 each week per pupil, to spend at supermarkets including Sainsbury's, Asda, Tesco, Morrisons, Waitrose and M&S. But the system has suffered problems including schools struggling to log on, parents being unable to download vouchers and some saying the vouchers failed when they tried to use them. The programme, which has cost more than £129m since lockdown began, also ran throughout the Easter and May half-term holidays. Calling for the government in England to change its decision, Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford said his family had once relied on free school meals. ""The system isn't built for families like mine to succeed,"" he said. Campaigners had also threatened legal action against the government if it didn't extend the food voucher scheme. Reversing the decision, Prime Minister Boris Johnson welcomed Mr Rashford's ""contribution to the debate around poverty"". A ""Covid summer food fund"" will now offer six-week food vouchers to children eligible for free school meals in England during the holidays."
42,What shops are open?,"Many non-essential shops have reopened, but will I be able to buy a book or have a haircut?","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 12:39:26 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52808931,"Many non-essential shops have reopened across the UK, as lockdown restrictions are eased. So, what can customers expect? Shops in England, including those offering clothes, toys, books and electronics, are now throwing open their doors to customers again. Shops in Northern Ireland have already reopened. Many have been announcing their plans: DIY, furniture and bicycle stores have also been reopening, following garden centres, open-air markets and car showrooms. Furniture giant Ikea opened 19 of its stores across England and Northern Ireland recently, prompting long queues. Supermarkets, corner shops, banks, pharmacies and petrol stations stayed open during lockdown. Shops which reopen must meet the government's Covid-19 secure guidelines. These include showing customers they are aware of safety measures, putting protective coverings on large items like beds or sofas, and frequent cleaning of regularly-touched surfaces. Perspex screens at the tills and floor markings to keep shoppers 2m (6ft) are likely to be a regular fixture. But some more unfamiliar measures - including pleas not to touch items unless you intend to buy - have been announced by some other shops. For example, John Lewis will clean baskets after each use, and will not let customers use fitting rooms. Services such as personal styling, the bureau de change and food and drink outlets will be closed. Marks & Spencer will also not be offering all of its services, such as its bra-fitting service, for example. All the staff at Next will wear plastic visors, with the option to also wear masks if they want to. Waterstones says it will quarantine books for 72 hours after people have touched them. River Island says it will do the same with items of clothing, Currys PC World says only 42 of its shops will be fully open from Monday, with full browsing access for customers. In another 89 outlets, shoppers will be able to request products at the entrance and have them collected by staff. Some shops, including Three UK and River Island, will have reduced opening hours to begin with. H&M says it will make customers use different entrances and exits, while only a limited number of people will be allowed in at any one time. Stores have been asked to encourage people to shop alone. Big retailers have been urged to talk to local authorities about providing extra parking and bike racks where possible, to stop people using public transport. The number of customers in stores will be limited, while shopping centres have been told they are responsible for controlling queues in common areas outside stores. In England, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels and cinemas will not be allowed to open their doors until 4 July at the earliest - and even then, only if they can meet social distancing measures. In Northern Ireland, all shops are now allowed to open. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said that all shops can open on Monday 22 June  as long as they have social distancing measures in place. In Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announced that smaller shops and outdoor markets will be allowed to reopen from 29 June in phase two of the country's lockdown-easing plan. Shops of all sizes will be able to open from that date as long as they have outdoor entrances and exits. Indoor shopping centres will remain closed, except for essential retailers such as supermarkets and pharmacists. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) predicted that it may take time for customers to return to their old shopping habits. It estimated that the lockdown has cost non-essential retailers £1.8bn a week in lost sales. However, there were queues outside some Primark shops in London and Birmingham before their 08:00 BST opening times. And the Birmingham branch opened its doors 35 minutes early to satisfy the demand. Queues also formed outside shops such as TK Maxx and Foot Locker in the centre of Manchester. With many people fearful for their jobs, now may not be the time to splurge on the High Street - but there may be bargains. Clothing retailers went into lockdown just after stocking up with spring and summer ranges, which they now need to shift."
43,Coronavirus: Could social distancing of less than two metres work?,The government is under pressure to relax the 2m social distancing rule - but is it safe to do so?,"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 09:27:50 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52522460,"A review into the 2m (6ft) social distancing rule has been commissioned by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He faces increasing pressure from his own MPs and the hospitality industry to allow people to be closer together, to help businesses after they reopen. However, the government's scientific advisers say that being 1m (just over 3ft) apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being 2m apart. The simple answer is that the nearer you are to someone who is infected, the greater the risk of catching the virus. The World Health Organization recommends keeping a distance of at least 1m. Some countries have adopted this guidance, often because they also insist on people wearing masks. Others, including the UK, have gone further: In a study published in medical journal The Lancet, scientists looked at research into how coronavirus spreads. They concluded that keeping at least 1m from other people could be the best way to limit the chances of infection. The risk of being infected is estimated to be 13% within 1m, but only 3% beyond that distance. And the study says that for every extra metre of distance up to 3m, the risk is further reduced by half. It can be traced back to research in the 1930s. Scientists found that droplets of liquid released by coughs or sneezes evaporate quickly in the air or fall to the ground. Most of those droplets, they reckoned, would land within 1-2m. That is why it is said the greatest risks come from having the virus coughed at you from close range, or from touching a surface that someone coughed onto, and then touching your face. Proximity and surface contact are considered the main transmission routes. But some researchers fear coronavirus can also be transported through the air in tiny particles called aerosols. If true, then the flow of wind from someone's breath could carry the virus over longer distances. Prof Lydia Bourouiba from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used high-speed cameras to capture a cough projecting miniature specks as far as 6m. And a study carried out in Chinese hospitals which found traces of coronavirus in Covid-19 wards and intensive care units, estimated that 4m was a better safe distance. But the US Centers for Disease Control says the role of aerosols in spreading the virus is ""currently uncertain"". And what's still not known is whether any virus that spreads further than 2m can still be infectious. Timing is also key. The longer you spend in close proximity with an infected person, the bigger the risk. Scientists advising the UK government say spending six seconds at a distance of 1m from someone is the same as spending one minute at a distance of 2m. Being exposed to someone coughing is riskier. Being 2m away from a cough carries the same risk as someone talking to you for 30 minutes at the same distance. A crowded stuffy room is bound to increase the chances of infection. The direction of air flow is also crucial - whether a draught or fan behind someone infected is pushing any virus they breathe out towards you. And a good supply of fresh air can make all the difference. In a restaurant in China, where nine people caught the virus, the air conditioning units mounted on the walls were blamed for recirculating the air rather than refreshing it. Japanese researchers investigated 110 cases of Covid-19 and found the odds of infection were nearly 19 times greater indoors than outside. Scientists advising the British government say every workplace or building should assess the risks. And they say where 2m of social distancing is impossible, people should only be closer for short periods of time. Plastic screens are suggested along with moving to shift patterns of work to minimise the numbers in at any one time. Arranging seating so people are not face to face is also judged to help. And in a growing number of many countries, including all parts of the UK, people are being encouraged to wear face coverings on public transport and ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"". It is only a few months since the coronavirus emerged, and in that short time scientists have learned a great deal about it. But we still don't know how much virus can be released by people who are infected and how much someone has to receive to catch the disease. Until that is established, the advice is that the risks are real - and that only when the numbers being infected drop dramatically can the distancing guidance be relaxed."
44,Coronavirus: What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work?,"Nine million people have accessed the scheme, which will move to its next phase in July.","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:19:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342,"Almost nine million workers who are unable to do their job because of the coronavirus outbreak have had their wages paid by the government. The furlough scheme was designed to help people put on leave because of the outbreak, and prevent mass redundancies. Firms have to start paying towards the scheme from August, and it will close entirely in October. So, if you've been put on furlough, what are your rights? The Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme puts workers on leave but allows them to stay on their company's payroll. Originally, furloughed employees couldn't do any work for their employer, but from 1 July they can go back to work part-time. For example, an employer could pay someone to work two days a week, while the furlough scheme would cover the other three days not worked. From 1 August, employers will have to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for their staff. In September, employers will have to pay 10% of furloughed employees' salaries - rising to 20% in October. Those workers will continue to receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. Yes. Employees can be made redundant at any point during the scheme, or when it ends. If they are entitled to redundancy pay it would be calculated based on the amount they earned before furlough. Firms can't use the money from furlough to subsidise redundancy packages. If you're made redundant while on furlough because your firm has gone bust, you can apply for payments from the Insolvency Service. At present, furloughed staff can't do any work for their employer. From July, they can be brought back to work on a part-time basis, In the meantime, they can volunteer in the community or even for their company as long as they aren't creating revenue or providing a service. Employers can give employees additional training, but must top up furlough payments if they do not reach minimum wage. If you work for more than one firm, you can receive furlough from any of them, up to £2,500 a month per employer. You can continue working for any that still need you or for a new employer, provided you are not breaching any existing contracts. The take-up has been significant, with about 8.9 million workers furloughed since March. Employers had made about £19.6bn of furlough claims by 7 June, and the scheme will cost the government an estimated £80bn in total. The scheme covers full-time, part-time, flexible, zero-hour and agency workers if they were on their employer's PAYE payroll on 19 March 2020. Workers must be furloughed for at least three weeks, and can be furloughed more than once. Check you are eligible for the scheme, and then work out how much to claim using the government's online calculator. Companies can top up this pay and must let employees know they have been furloughed. You can claim 80% of your employees' wages - capped at £2,500 per employee per month before tax, or £576.92 a week. If employees' pay varies each month, you will need to calculate your claim manually, or seek professional advice. Furlough covers overtime and commission payments built into an employee's salary, but not discretionary payments such as tips or optional bonuses. HMRC will check your claim, and pay you through a UK bank within about six working days. What does it mean if I've been furloughed by work? Any UK organisation with employees can apply, but it will mainly be private sector businesses and charities making a claim. Apprentices can also be furloughed and continue their training. An individual can furlough an employee, such as a nanny, if they are paid through PAYE. The self-employed who are adversely affected by the virus are eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of their average monthly profit, if they meet certain conditions. They must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and earn an average of less than £50,000 in a tax year.  Those who receive it can continue to work. The grant is offered as a one-off payment covering three months, up to a maximum of £7,500. Applications for a second grant will open in August. Anyone on furlough retains the same employment rights. If you are ill you are eligible for statutory sick pay or can be placed on furlough. If you are on unpaid leave, shielding or have caring responsibilities, you are also eligible. Staff on parental leave will still receive statutory pay from the government. Employers do not have to top up salaries that no longer reach the minimum wage."
45,Can I stay with my boyfriend now? And other questions,"Questions about support bubbles, and other coronavirus topics","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 23:39:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-51176409,"In some parts of the UK, some people are being allowed to have close contact once again with people from outside their household. BBC News answers questions about who can form a ""support bubble"", and other questions about coronavirus. If you and your boyfriend both live alone and in England, the good news is that from 13 June, you can form a support bubble, which means that you can spend as much as time as you want in each other’s company, inside or outside a house. You don’t have to keep a 2m distance from one another, and you can stay overnight at each other’s house. If you are living alone, and your partner is in a shared household (or vice versa), matters get complicated. You can still form a support bubble with your boyfriend but it will also be with his household, and it would be the only bubble allowed to that household. What this means is that if one of your boyfriend’s housemates has a partner who is - like you - living elsewhere and alone, that couple will be prevented from meeting up. Support bubbles are for the benefit of people who are living alone (or alone with children). If both you and your boyfriend are living in shared households, you are not allowed to form one and you are restricted to meeting outdoors and at a distance of 2m from each other. You cannot form a support bubble with your boyfriend if he lives in Scotland or Wales, although Northern Ireland has announced that it is also introducing support bubbles from 13 June.. As a single grandparent, you will have the right to form a “support bubble” with your grandson and his family. Under the government’s new guidance, from 13 June your grandson would be able to stay at your home, including overnight, and would not need to keep a 2m distance. However, the complicating factor here is your lodger. Are you maintaining a 2m distance from each other, and are you using separate rooms and facilities? If the answer is yes, then there should be no problem. On the other hand, if you have been using the same kitchen, living room and bathroom, and eating from the same crockery and cutlery as your lodger, then you are both effectively part of the same household, and you do not qualify to be part of a support bubble. There is no current date for reopening tattoo parlours in the UK, and the Tattoo and Piercing Industry Union (TPIU) says it has not received any guidance from the government on when this might happen. In the official guidance on which businesses must stay closed for the present, tattoo parlours are listed in the category of personal care, alongside hairdressers, barbers and beauty and nail salons. Under the plans for easing lockdown, 4 July is the earliest date on which personal care outlets could be allowed to reopen in England. There is no set date in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. Extra hygiene measures are certain to be put in place as a condition of reopening - the TPIU says these are likely to include “masks for everyone, visors/goggles for artists and paying more attention to more thorough cleaning between customers and regularly throughout the day”. Caravan parks were told to close at the end of March, along with hotels, B&Bs and other types of holiday accommodation. Although some aspects of the lockdowns, people are still not supposed to stay overnight away from their own home for a holiday or similar purpose. The only exception to this rule is for people for whom a static caravan is their home. The government has said it wants to get England’s tourism sector running again from 4 July onwards “as long as it is safe to do so” but has not released any details of how this will happen. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told MPs that self-contained accommodation had a lower risk than other areas, and said, ""I would hope that that will be at the front of the queue."" The situation is clearer in Northern Ireland, where static caravans will be open for business  from 20 July onwards. In Scotland, the tourism industry has been given a conditional date of 15 July for reopening. Caravan parks are currently set to stay closed in Wales until 26 September although the Welsh government is reviewing the situation every three weeks. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia. Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. University of Oxford’s Prof Sarah Gilbert, who is working on creating a vaccine for Covid-19, says that it “probably is likely” that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. The UK government views antibody tests - which can show if a person has had Covid-19 - as central to its plans to end the current lockdown and allow people to return to work. But the World Health Organization has said that there is no evidence that antibody tests can show that a person has immunity or is protected against reinfection. Scientists have said that the “incubation period” - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home. For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health could take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many ""silent spreaders"" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many ""silent carriers"" there may be. Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk who should shield at home. However, some may be advised to shield if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures. Dental practices in England have been told they can reopen on 8 June, as long as they put appropriate safety measures in place. These include limiting use of waiting areas, screening staff on a daily basis and installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas. Currently, if a patient is in considerable pain, dentists can refer them to an Urgent Dental Care (UDC) hub. These centres have been created across the UK to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. If a UDC centre is not available in your area, there may be other options. Some hospitals, for example, offer emergency dental walk-in services. But you should always speak to your local dentist first - or use the NHS 111 online service if you’re not registered with one. Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks has become commonplace not just in hospitals but also among the general public. It presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldn’t be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. They say it might be worth using a small whiteboard to communicate. There are also some subtitling or captioning apps that may provide some help. Yes. According to the advice from Public Health England, a scarf or a bandana tied around your head is fine. The important thing is that it covers both your mouth and your nose – and that you can breathe easily. Whether you are wearing a scarf or a homemade mask, the advice is that you should continue to maintain other hygiene measures. So wash your hands, or use hand sanitiser before you put your face covering on and off, and don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth at all. Wash the face coverings after each time you use them (for this reason it might be worth avoiding textiles which need special care, such as wool or silk) and keep the used face coverings in a plastic bag until you can wash them. Quarantining cities and telling people to stay at home may seem extreme, but the alternative is to let the virus spread unrestrained. There is no vaccine for this new virus, as there is for flu, which makes elderly people and those with underlying health conditions very vulnerable to its effects. If you’re living with someone who’s self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started - this is how long it can take for symptoms to appear. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for seven days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 14 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 14 days. The current government advice is to access medical assistance remotely, wherever possible. However, those with a scheduled hospital or other medical appointment during this period, should talk to their GP or clinician. This is to ensure that they continue to receive the care they need and consider whether appointments can be postponed. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway. ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. ""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."" It’s actually difficult to know how many new cases of coronavirus there have been during the lockdown, because until recently, there has been very little testing of the population as a whole (it was mostly just those in hospital and some NHS and care staff who were being tested). There is also a lag effect with the figures. It takes time for the effects of social distancing to be seen in the daily figures for cases, hospitalisations and then deaths - around three weeks at least - so it may appear as if there are more cases than there currently are. It’s true that some people have been ignoring the rules regarding lockdown. But police chiefs say that compliance is still holding up. What we do know is that confirmed daily cases of the virus have been on a downward trend since early April, and the rate of infection has dropped significantly. There’s also been a fall in the number of new people being hospitalised, or dying from the virus. Where there does seem to be a steady rise in the number of cases is in the UK’s care homes. Latest figures suggest that a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales - and nearly half of those in Scotland and Northern Ireland - take place there. Following a drop in hospital patients with Covid-19, the NHS has now outlined its approach to resuming other services in England. Urgent outpatient appointments will go ahead and routine surgery could be restarted, but GPs will continue to use online consultations, and regular testing will be offered to all staff. The NHS says the pressure on many staff will ""remain unprecedented"" and employers must keep them safe. Routine elective surgery will be restarted, with priority given to ""long waiters"", and cancer referral and diagnostic appointments will be brought back to “pre-Covid-19 levels”. Discussions are taking place in Wales and Northern Ireland on how to resume normal NHS services. Scotland's health secretary has announced that NHS services will be gradually restarted, without committing to any dates. The simple answer is that we simply don’t know. People who were in the highest risk category if they were to contract coronavirus were contacted by the NHS in March and told not to go out for 12 weeks. These are people with specific medical conditions. The government is now advising these people - more than one million around the UK - to shield until the end of June. Vulnerable people in England and Wales have been advised that from the beginning of June, they will be able to go outdoors with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. If you are concerned about whether a call, text or email is genuine, you can check the NHS England Test and Trace service website or the Scottish Government Test and Protect website or the Public Health Agency website in Northern Ireland. Genuine contract tracers will never ask you for any financial information such as credit card or bank details. They will also not ask you to set up a password or Pin over the phone, or to call a premium rate number, such as those starting 09 or 087. If you don’t want to talk over the phone in England, you can ask for an email or text inviting you to log into the web-based service instead. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The government’s chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that ""infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in general”. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals. It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. In general, children appear to be relatively unaffected by coronavirus, according to data from China and other countries. This may be because they are able to shake off the infection or have no symptoms or only very mild ones similar to a cold. However, children with underlying lung problems, such as asthma, may have to be more careful. All schools in the UK are currently closed, except for vulnerable pupils or children of key workers. You can walk your dog as much as you like. The government has said people can exercise outside as many times a day as they want, and can spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. There is no guidance from the government on whether your dog should be on a lead, but the Royal Parks, for instance, urge visitors to do this, to help ensure people practise social distancing. The government has said people in England can exercise outside as many times a day as they want. They can also spend time outside not exercising, as long as they remain 2m (6ft) away from anyone outside their household. The Welsh and Scottish governments have also said people can exercise outdoors more than once a day. You still can't use playgrounds, outdoor gyms or other outdoor leisure venues, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces. In England, you can drive to outdoor open spaces to exercise irrespective of distance, as long as you follow social distancing while you are there. However, in Scotland and Wales, people are being told to stay within about 5 miles of their homes while outside. In Northern Ireland, there are ""no restrictions"" on travel for those who are not self-isolating. Yes it is. Government guidance on staying at home says: ""Where parents do not live in the same household, children under 18 can be moved between their parents' homes."" If neither parent nor child is showing symptoms of the virus or self-isolating, children of separated parents are still allowed to stay with either of them. However, the Family Division of the High Court has said that, in England and Wales, if one parent is worried that moving their child would be going against public health advice, they may ""vary the arrangement to one that they consider to be safe"", even if the other parent does not agree. Where this is the case, family courts will expect parents to allow contact by video chat or phone. It depends on a number of factors. ""Typical"" business trips to Germany are not currently permitted except to workers carrying out ""essential functions"" such as healthcare. A certificate from your employer to that effect will be needed if that is the case. With the introduction of quarantine restrictions at UK borders from 8 June, returning to the UK will not as straightforward. Anyone entering the UK from that point will need to self-isolate for 14 days after arrival. There are a number of exemptions to this rule, including UK residents who ordinarily travel overseas at least once a week for work. Driving tests were suspended in England, Scotland and Wales for three months from 20 March. So unless it was booked for a date after 20 June, the test will not take place as planned. A similar situation is in place in Northern Ireland. A new date for anyone whose test is cancelled will be automatically sent out by the Driver and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA). You cannot book a new date for a driving test yourself. You can still apply for an emergency driving test if you’re classed as a critical worker. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, taking a family member out for a driving lesson is still not allowed, as it is not counted as an essential journey. The Department for Transport has indicated that this is also still the case In England, despite the recent lockdown changes. However, the AA says it’s not clear whether this would be the case if, for example, a driving lesson was given on the way to do essential shopping. People affected by coronavirus will be able to delay their mortgage payments for up to three months. It is important to bear in mind that any interest and capital repayments which are missed, will be added to the mortgage balance. This means that any future monthly mortgage bills are likely to be slightly higher. Energy companies have promised to help you if you have a pre-payment meter. So you may be able to authorise a friend to top up your energy card for you. You could also ask your supplier to send you a card by post which is already topped up. The government says that if it's urgent the supplier should be able to add credit directly to your account. You should be able to top up online as well. And you will have to pay back any credit your supplier gives you. So you should contact them to ask about when and how to do this. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines are struggling to meet that deadline. Ryanair, for example, says customers who want a cash refund will receive it ''in due course'' as it is dealing with a much higher volume of requests than usual, with fewer staff. Many airlines are trying to avoid giving refunds and are offering vouchers for another flight or a free re-booking instead. If the airline later folds, the voucher will probably become invalid. And any rebooking could affect the terms of your travel insurance. If you’re self-employed, you could be eligible for a taxable grant of up to 80% of your trading profits up to a cap of £2,500 per month, if your livelihood has been affected by the pandemic, and you meet certain conditions. You must have been self-employed since at least the start of April 2019, and have a trading profit of less than £50,000 a year on average. Initially, this was a one-off payment designed to cover March, April and May, up to a maximum total of £7,500. In August, applications will open for a ""second and final"" payment covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of £2,190 a month for another three months (£6,570 in total). The scheme - which is called the Coronavirus Self-Employment Income Support Scheme - is open to any claimant who makes more than half of their income from self-employment. The government has said that everyone should work from home if possible, and only go into a workplace if their job ""absolutely cannot be done from home"". Your employer has a duty to protect your health and safety. If you or a member of your household have an underlying health condition which increases vulnerability to coronavirus, you could argue that you have a right not to come into work. If you still do not want to go in, you could ask to take time off as holiday or unexpected leave, but your employer does not have to agree to this. An employer could bring disciplinary action against an employee who they consider to be refusing to work without a good reason. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education aren’t usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they can’t work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth £95.85 per week, as long as they qualify. However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. The government says that this plan is still on course. At the beginning of lockdown, the government promised to provide laptops and tablets for disadvantaged children and young people, so that they would not fall behind in online learning organised by their schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told MPs on the Education Select Committee that 200,000 laptops would be delivered, some at the end of May, but most of them in June. On 9 June Mr Williamson told the House of Commons that 100,000 laptops had been distributed, prioritising children who have social workers, and that the government was on schedule to distribute all the computers over the coming month. However, he faced criticism from the opposition that the roll-out was taking too long. Labour MP Meg Hillier said that it was “already late for vulnerable pupils, and with no clear plan about catch-up”. Separate schemes to provide vulnerable children and adults with laptops have been announced in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Although the government has changed its advice on the use of face coverings in public places, it still recommends that face masks or face coverings should not be worn in schools. It adds that face coverings should not be worn in any circumstances by those who are not able to handle them properly (for example, small children or those with special educational needs or disabilities), as they may “inadvertently increase the risk of transmission”. Trish Greenhalgh, professor of primary care health sciences at the University of Oxford, told the Times Educational Supplement that face coverings could also have a bad effect on the mental health of some children: “If compulsory masking is going to tip some kids into a bad space after weeks of stressful lockdown, we need to balance that risk with the potential benefits.” Meanwhile, other countries have taken different approaches when reopening schools. In France, for example, face masks are compulsory for teachers and pupils aged 11 and over, but they are not worn in Denmark. There are no current plans to open schools for most pupils during the summer holidays, but the situation varies across the UK. In England, some Nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children have gone back, but the government has dropped plans for all primary school pupils to return before the summer. Similarly, some Year 10 and Year 12 students in England will go back from 15 June, but the government has confirmed that secondary schools may not fully reopen until September ""at the earliest"". Schools in Wales will reopen from 29 June for all age groups, but only a third of pupils will be in class at any one time. The summer term has been extended by a week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland won’t be returning until after the summer holidays in August. Across the UK, some vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers have been in school throughout the crisis, including during the Easter holidays, but it is not yet clear whether that provision will continue over the summer break. Playgrounds are still closed in England. The next review of lockdown easing is due towards the end of the month, so changes may be considered then. In Scotland, playgrounds are set to reopen from 18 June, when the country moves into phase two of its lockdown-easing plans. There is no date yet for reopening in Wales, while there is no detail on this in Northern Ireland’s recovery plan - but decisions will be delegated to councils, as they are responsible for playgrounds. Ultimately this is a personal decision, but it echoes what a lot of students are thinking right now. A recent survey of students applying for undergraduate places found that more than one in five were considering deferring for a year if universities were not going to operate normally. University campuses have been closed this term by the Covid-19 outbreak and there is no guarantee how far they will open in the autumn. The University of Cambridge has said it will have no face-to-face lectures in the next academic year, and the University of Manchester has said that, to begin with, its lectures will be taking place online only. Other universities are considering a delay to the start of the academic year. Before you make a firm choice, the higher education watchdog, Office for Students, says your university should give you “absolute clarity” on whether courses will be online, on-campus or a mixture. And if the information isn't available next month it must be provided before clearing in August. Once you have all the information, you need to weigh up what's important to you. Bear in mind the universities minister says you'll have to pay full fees even if you're learning online - but if you are offered distance learning you could potentially save on accommodation and other living expenses. Also, if your university can offer a campus experience, access to facilities like libraries, bars  and cafes is likely to be limited - so student life could be very different to normal. The Department for Education has indicated that it is possible for students to get their fees back. In a statement, it said that if universities are “unable to facilitate adequate online tuition then it would be unacceptable for students to be charged for any additional terms”. To claim a refund, students first need to complain directly to their university. If that is unsuccessful then students in England or Wales can lodge an appeal with the Office of the Independent Adjudicator (OIA). If your university is in Scotland then it’s the SPSO (Scottish Public Services Ombudsman) and for Northern Ireland, you go to the NIPSO (Northern Ireland Public Services Ombudsman).  Students will need a “completions procedure form” from their university in order to file an appeal. Most students have gone home to self-isolate, leaving their student properties empty but they still have to pay rent. If you’re worried about paying rent for an empty student property, first of all check your tenancy agreement. Some contracts will have a “break clause” which will allow you to cancel your lease early if you give your landlord enough notice. If you don’t have a “break clause”, you can always speak to your landlord and ask for a “reduced payment plan”. This could mean you pay less rent each month. The Ministry of Justice has not given a date for the resumption of visits. It says the measures are temporary, and that the restrictions will be reviewed at some point, taking into account public health advice. Prison visits were suspended at the beginning of the lockdown in March. Since then, relatives and friends have had the option of writing to inmates, or sending an email to the prison, which is then printed out and passed on. As a temporary measure, secure phone handsets have been given to pre-approved prisoners at 55 prisons, allowing them to speak to a small number of pre-authorised contacts. Video calls are also being rolled out at a number of prisons and young offender institutions. The earliest point at which places of worship could open is early July, when the prime minister says some public places could reopen, “provided they are safe and enforce social distancing”. However, several religious leaders have expressed doubt that they will be able to ease restrictions soon. Ibrahim Mogra, a senior imam in Leicester, told the BBC that mosques present particular problems: ""We are talking about a five times regular daily attendance compared to other places of worship,"" he said. ""So we are talking about really large numbers of people."" The Church of England says that it does not expect to resume normal services before the end of the year, although the approach would vary on a regional basis. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, who’s leading the Church’s plans for reopening, says questions remain about various aspects of worship including sharing hymn books, distancing within the church buildings, and Holy Communion. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If you’re worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. People experiencing symptoms will be asked to report this as soon as possible and order a test. You can either do this via the NHS website or if you do not have access to the internet you can dial 119 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland or 0800 028 2816 in Scotland. If you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive you may be contacted by text message, email or phone. The only part of the process which will need a smartphone is the contact tracing app. That has not yet been launched in England outside the Isle of Wight. When it is, it will provide extra information for contact tracers, but they will still be able to do everything else via a landline or online. You will only be asked to report contacts known to you, especially anyone in your household, people with whom you’ve been in close physical contact (less than 1m (3ft)), or have been within 2m (6ft) of for more than 15 minutes. The government's contact tracing app is not yet up and running. When it becomes widely available, it will be used to track down contacts like strangers with whom you’ve shared a bus or train carriage. No. The tracers will be interested in anybody who has had close contact with a person who has tested positive. Close contact means being less than 1m (3ft) from somebody at any point, or between 1m and 2m away for more than 15 minutes. You shouldn't be that close to a delivery driver. There is a small potential risk of contamination if the food or packaging has been handled by someone who has tested positive. Online shopping customers are therefore generally advised to leave packaged goods for 72 hours if possible before handling them, or to spray and wipe plastic or glass containers with diluted bleach. Unwrapped fresh goods should be washed under running water and left to dry. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you don’t have to go into quarantine if you’re returning to the UK from what’s known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the ""Dublin dodge"") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt. The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland. The government guidance details what you’ll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work you’ll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you. However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them. Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands. Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. What questions do you have about coronavirus?

46,Coronavirus: Five ways shopping will be different from now on,"Shops in England are preparing to welcome customers back but what will the ""new normal"" look like?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 21:01:40 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53005123,"On Monday, non-essential shops in England will be allowed to reopen for the first time since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed. This includes retailers offering clothes, toys, books, furniture and electronics. For many people stuck indoors for weeks, it will be a welcome change of scene. But with hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK, shopping will not be like it was before 23 March. Here are five ways it will be different from next week. We've all seen the 2m markings and arrows on the floor in supermarkets showing customers how far apart they need to stay and which way to walk, and this will now be the case in other non-essential stores too. People will also be asked to keep a set distance between each other on escalators. At John Lewis, for example, shoppers will be required to stand eight steps behind each other. And only one person at a time will be allowed to use a lift at the department store, unless they are from the same household. At Primark, two people can use a lift but only if they stand on designated spots. There will be hand sanitising stations throughout shops and people will be encouraged to use hand gel when they enter a shop. Shop assistants will look different as well. At Next, employees will wear a protective visor and have the option of wearing an additional mouth and nose mask. Many retailers are also fitting plastic screens at tills. And there will be a lot more cleaning going on - of shopping baskets, door handles, counters and escalator rails. Selfridges is one of the few retailers that will allow people to try clothes on but each fitting room will be sanitised by steaming and antibacterial cleaning after each customer use. Government guidelines recommend people should shop alone where possible so hopes of hitting the stores with friends will have to wait. Some retailers, such as Primark, will allow a group of people into their shops from Monday but they must be from the same household. They will also have to follow social distancing rules once they are inside the branch. Dan Simms, co-head of the UK retail agency team at Colliers International, reckons ""the younger demographic will take advantage of the lifting of restrictions to socialise and visit retail destinations"". But that is not expected to happen immediately from Monday as at the moment six people from different households are only allowed to meet outside. And some shopping malls, such as Manchester's Trafford Centre and others owned by Intu, have removed indoor seating areas to ""support social distancing"" and ""to discourage people from gathering"". Meanwhile, stopping for a coffee with a friend or sitting down for a bite to eat will be limited because some stores will not reopen their in-house cafes or restaurants. The British Retail Consortium's guidance is that customers should be discouraged from handling products that they're not going to buy. But the policy very much varies from retailer to retailer. At Selfridges, shoppers can try on shoes and the footwear will be sanitised afterwards. Kurt Geiger will also allow people to try on shoes - provided they use anti-bacterial hand gel first as well as a pop sock - but then the footwear will be placed in quarantine for 12 hours. But at H&M, people will not be allowed to try on footwear at all. It is the same for clothing. At Next, for example, customers can handle clothes but at Selfridges, shoppers will be asked not to touch items unless they intend to buy them. If they do, the garment will be quarantined for 72 hours. This is based on government guidance that the risk of infection from coronavirus on a surface is likely to be ""reduced significantly"" after a three-day period. The majority of retailers will close their changing rooms and goods returned will be quarantined for 72 hours. Some shops will also offer contactless returns. At Primark, customers will present the item they want to return to a staff member at a till, complete with their receipt which will be scanned. People will receive their refund and take their item to a returns section where it will be held for 72 hours before going back on the shop floor. At Waterstone's, that three-day rule will also apply to books that customers browse through in store, which will allow them to ""self-heal"", according to chief executive James Daunt. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people will not be allowed to handle makeup or sniff a perfume bottle. But picking things up in a shop might be a hard habit to break for some, says consumer psychologist Kate Nightingale. ""There will be this almost automatic behaviour of your muscles where you want to touch something,"" she says. ""But then you're in the middle of the flow of your hand to the counter [and] you will remind yourself, 'No, I can't.'"" And this can create other problems. Conventional wisdom suggests everyone will be delighted to get out of the house and treat themselves to a day's shopping from Monday. Not quite, says Ms Nightingale. Restrictions in shops, such as not touching items or being told which direction to walk in is likely to frustrate people already experiencing anxiety since lockdown was enforced on 23 March. ""We are basically living in a constant state of fear and anxiety - don't leave the house, don't touch anyone, don't do exactly what you were doing before - this is not a normal way of human behaviour,"" says Ms Nightingale. That means people will be going back to shops after more than three months ""with a pre-existing huge ball of negativity in our head, whether we want it or not"". Even the smallest things can cause grumpiness. At HMV, which has already reopened stores in Canada and the US, shoppers are asked to sanitise their hands before handling any merchandise. ""There are confrontations in stores about it,"" Doug Putman, the owner of HMV, told the BBC. ""For some customers, they are very comfortable, for [others], they are a little less comfortable. And I think it just comes down to your personality type."" On the whole, though, he expects people will do their bit. ""What you've got is an overall public sentiment that even if you don't believe that you should have to sanitise and this and that, you're going to do it because it is the right thing."" Much like supermarkets, retailers will ask shoppers to queue to prevent overcrowding in stores and allow people to maintain 2m social distancing. To relieve the tedium, some department store Selfridges will employ DJs to help make it a more ""joyful experience"". It may also take longer to pay for your shopping as some retailers will close every other cashier to prevent people being in close proximity to each other. People may also have to wait for their favourite shop to even open in the first place. While retailers like Primark will open 153 stores in England on Monday, John Lewis is initially only reopening two sites, at Poole and Kingston-upon-Thames. It intends to reopen 11 more stores the following week. Stores are being chosen on the proviso they are easily accessible by car, ""therefore reducing the reliance on public transport for partners and customers""."
47,Coronavirus bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours?,"Some people in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland can form ""support bubbles"".","Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:19:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52637354,"As lockdown restrictions are eased further, people in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland can now set up support bubbles. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact. The idea was first introduced in New Zealand. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can now form a support bubble with one other household. The second household can be of any size. Nobody who is shielding should join a bubble. The independent advisory group Sage has been asked to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubbles. Announcing the latest easing of rules in Wales on 19 June, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he expected to make a decision about whether to introduce social bubbles in the next few weeks. Support bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in each bubble can visit each other's homes and go inside. They won't have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can even stay overnight. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. There is no limit on how far you can travel in England for your support bubble but local is best, the government says. You can't bubble with anyone in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. Social and family groups are complicated and might not fit bubble rules. Grandparents: Single parents: If you are single: You can read the government's guidelines for England in full here. If you don't live on your own, or you are not a single parent whose children are under 18, then the rules haven't changed. However, you can, of course, invite someone eligible to join a social bubble with your household. Otherwise, you must meet people you don't live with outside. The number of people you are allowed to meet depends on where in the UK you live. Basically, when people mix - especially in crowded places - coronavirus can spread. The virus is transmitted by droplets from infected people when they talk, cough and sneeze. These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object. That's why people have been asked to maintain social distancing when meeting anyone not from their household. Bubbles allow some people more contact with others, while keeping other social distancing measures in place. Who will be in your social bubble?

48,Coronavirus symptoms: What are they and how do I protect myself?,Loss of taste and smell have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 19:53:57 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366,"The NHS has listed three main symptoms of coronavirus, that people should be aware of and ready to act upon. If you, or someone you live with, has any of these symptoms the advice is stay at home to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of symptoms also includes chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain and sore throat. It takes five days on average to start showing the symptoms, but some people will get them much later. The World Health Organization says incubation lasts up to 14 days. The majority of people with coronavirus will recover after rest and pain relief (such as paracetamol). The main reason people need hospital treatment is difficulty breathing. Doctors may scan the lungs to see how badly they are affected and give support, such as oxygen or ventilation, if needed. However, people should not go to A&E if they are concerned. In the UK, the NHS 111 website will guide you through what to do. If you are so breathless that you are unable to speak more than a few words you will be told to call 999, as this is a medical emergency. If you become so ill that you've stopped doing all of your usual daily activities then it will advise speaking to a nurse by dialling NHS 111. Intensive care units are specialist wards for people who are very ill. Coronavirus patients will get oxygen support, which can involve using a facemask or a tube in the nose. The most invasive way - for the most seriously ill patients - is ventilation where air, with increased levels of oxygen, is pushed into the lungs via a tube in the mouth, nose or through a small cut in the throat.  Patients with mild symptoms should self-isolate at home for at least seven days. People are advised not to ring NHS 111 to report their symptoms unless they are worried. They should also not go to their GP, or A&E. Details for Scotland are to check NHS inform, then ring your GP in office hours, or 111 out-of-hours. In Wales call NHS 111, and in Northern Ireland, call your GP. If you have come into contact with somebody who may be infected, you may be told to self-isolate. The World Health Organization has also issued advice for the public. Older people, and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure), are more likely to become severely ill. Men are at slightly higher risk of dying from the virus than women. The best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water. Coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. So, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important. People will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick. In England and Scotland, people are being advised to wear face masks in shops and on public transport to help prevent the spread of the virus. Follow James on Twitter.

49,Coronavirus: What is a recession?,The world faces the worst recession for 80 years. But what does that mean?,"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:14:36 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52986863,"The UK, along with much of the rest of the world, is thought to be heading into the worst recession for decades. So what exactly does that mean? In normal times, a country's economy grows. Its citizens, on average, get slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes the value of goods and services produced falls. A recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. If a recession carries on for a long time, or is particularly bad, it is known as a depression. For most people, economic growth is a good thing. It usually means there are more jobs to go round. Companies are generally more profitable and can afford to pay employees and shareholders more. A growing economy also means the government gets more money in taxes. So it has room to cut taxes, or spend more on benefits, public services and the wages of government workers. When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse. Most of the developed world saw negative growth - or falling GDP - for January to March 2020, as the economic impact of coronavirus began to hit. The official figures for April to June haven't been published yet, but they are likely to show even bigger falls. This would mean a second quarter of negative growth, confirming that much of the world is in recession. In the UK, the economy shrank by 2% from January to March, according to the Office for National Statistics. It then shrank by 20.4% in April - the largest monthly contraction on record - in its first full month in lockdown. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts huge falls in GDP for 2020 as a whole - an extraordinary fall of 5.9% for the US and 6.5% for the UK. In fact the IMF estimates the entire world economy will shrink by 3% this year, making it the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Some people may lose their jobs, or find it harder to secure new opportunities and promotions. Graduates and school leavers looking for their first job could find fewer openings available. Those staying in work may miss out on pay rises - or have to work longer hours or accept pay cuts. The UK government's spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), suggested the unemployment rate could more than double, to 10% this summer. It also estimates that the government might have to borrow more than £300bn to cover the cost of the crisis. However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. For instance, many people in the UK who owned houses with mortgages and kept their jobs during the last recession did OK. The Bank of England cut interest rates to support the economy, which reduced mortgage interest payments for many considerably, leaving them with more money to spend. Others, such as benefit recipients or public sector workers, did less well. In the UK the last recession, caused by the global financial crisis, lasted five quarters - from the second quarter of 2008 onwards. GDP fell by an estimated 7.2% over the whole period. Unemployment rose sharply, but it began to fall back again two years later. And there was a massive deficit - the gap between what the government raises in taxes and what it spends on public services. This resulted in a near-doubling of the national debt, and a decade-long programme of austerity. There were steep cuts in many areas of government spending, except health, education and international aid. The IMF predicts the recession will be over next year and the world economy will start bouncing back. But we are in uncharted territory, and no-one knows how strong that recovery will be. If all the businesses which shut during the pandemic and lockdown could open quickly, the consequences of the recession would be less severe. However, there are fears over whether the virus will start spreading again, and people may be wary of travelling or going out even if they're told it's safe. Cruises, air travel and business conferences in particular could take years to bounce back. So the consequences of this recession will be felt for years to come. A reliable way of controlling Covid-19, such as a vaccine, would help create a strong recovery. But until that is found, there are a few remedies available. In the last recession, central banks cut interest rates to support the economy. That meant people and businesses could borrow more easily, and had more to spend. But interest rates are already close to zero in many places, and it may not be possible to cut them much further. Governments around the world are already borrowing huge sums to support their economies through tax cuts and higher public spending - such as furlough schemes, support for businesses, and even direct cash payments to citizens. But that borrowing comes at a cost, which will be felt for decades to come."
50,"Coronavirus: When will pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants reopen?","Pubs and restaurants in England are expected to reopen in July, but can I meet a friend for a meal?","Thu, 11 Jun 2020 10:07:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52977388,"Pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants in England may soon be able to reopen their doors for the first time since lockdown began in March. But despite the easing of restrictions, a trip to a local bar or dining establishment could be a very different experience from how it was before coronavirus. In its recovery strategy document published on 11 May, the government said that the hospitality sector - which includes pubs, bars and restaurants - could start to reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"", if Covid-19 safety guidelines could be met. The government has yet to announce details of what these guidelines would be, but they're expected to include rules on social distancing, heightened hygiene procedures and protection of bar and restaurant staff. It will provide ""further safer working guidance"" for restaurants, pubs and bars ""as soon as we can"", Business Secretary Alok Sharma said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing. On 20 March, all pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes were asked to shut in order to stop the spread of coronavirus The only exceptions to this were cafes and canteens at a few selected places such as schools, hospitals and prisons. Since then, many restaurants have started offering food delivery and takeaways in order to generate income while their doors are closed. Some pubs have also been allowed to offer takeaway beers. Each nation of the UK is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: The chief worry for many people in the hospitality industry is the issue of social distancing. Some have insisted that the current 2m distancing rule makes it impossible for bars, cafes and restaurants to make a profit. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of the industry body UK Hospitality, says that with a 2m rule, outlets would be only able to make about 30% of normal revenues, whereas 1m would increase that to 60-75%. Some Conservative MPs have added their support for reducing social distancing, and the prime minister said on 10 June that the 2m rule was ""under constant review"". The Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca says it is considering a range of measures to keep staff and workers safe amid the pandemic. Customers are likely to be given the option of ordering food on apps, while staff will be encouraged to wash their hands every 20 minutes. Meanwhile, the Wetherspoons pub chain has said its staff will be provided with face masks and protective eyewear and it will run a reduced food menu. Bottles of ketchup and mayonnaise will be replaced by individual sachets. Customers will also be encouraged to sit outside in pub gardens, while some indoor seating areas will be separated by Perspex screens. The hospitality sector was the third-largest employer in the country in 2018, according to UK Hospitality. But many restaurants and cafes were already struggling even before the Covid-19 outbreak, in the face of rising rents and falling consumer spending. Since lockdown began, job cuts and closures have been announced by chains such as Frankie & Benny's and Carluccio's.  3rdlargest UK employer in 2018 3.2 millionworkers in the sector 99%of hospitality businesses are SMEs £130bnannual turnover in 2018 67%expect it will be ""months"" before going to a restaurant Thousands of workers in the industry have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, which allows them to receive 80% of their monthly salary up to £2,500. Many other countries have already reopened restaurants, bars and cafes around the world. In some cases they have had the use of lower social distancing recommendations - in France, for example, the recommended distance between customer and staff is 1m."
51,Coronavirus: Five unanswered questions on the travel quarantine rules,Travellers to the UK now have to self-isolate for 14 days. But how will the rules work in practice?,"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 12:05:13 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52963306,"Most people entering the UK from overseas are now expected to self-isolate for 14 days. But there are still questions about how quarantine will be enforced and why it has been implemented now. Under the new rules, most travellers entering the UK by land, air or sea must complete an online form in the 48 hours before they arrive, stating where they will be staying in the UK while self-isolating and how they can be contacted. They could be fined £100 for not filling in the form, while there is a fine of up to £1,000 in England for those who are found to be not complying with the self-isolation rules. However, when filling in this ""contact locator"" form, travellers are given the option to not put down an address at all, or to put down more than one. The Home Office says that if someone arrives without a place to stay, then they will have to book accommodation at their own expense at a list of hotels provided, using its bookings system. One reason people can put down more than one address is in case they need to stay in a hotel before moving on to their ultimate destination, or are legally obliged to change addresses, it adds, for example due to a court order. Guidance for border officials, seen by the BBC, indicates that unless the port of entry is particularly quiet, it is likely only ""spot checks"" will be used to see if passengers have filled out the forms. The guidance states that border staff will generally have no way of checking whether addresses are real. They are advised to accept the information given unless other factors suggest there are ""credibility concerns"" - for example ""stating that their name is Mickey Mouse or that their address is Buckingham Palace"". Public Health England (PHE) says it will contact 20% of those required to self-isolate via a phone call and text message. If they have reason to suspect that somebody isn't complying, then their details can ultimately be passed to police who will enforce the measures as a last resort. However, the Home Office says police do not have a right to enter someone's home on the basis of this offence. What's more, there are several reasons why someone is permitted to not be at an address, for example if they need to buy essential supplies and have no-one to do this for them. Home Secretary Priti Patel says the decision to bring in a travel quarantine system now is ""guided by science"", as UK transmission (or the spread of the virus) is low enough for imported cases to potentially cause a ""devastating second wave"". Prof John Aston, the Home Office's chief scientific adviser, says the ""scientific advice so far is clear"" that the impact of the policy would have been ""negligible"" while transmission rates were higher. ""As the number of infections within the UK drops, we must now manage the risk of transmissions being reintroduced from elsewhere,"" he says. However, some have questioned the decision to bring in quarantine measures now, when the UK has a higher transmission rate than many other countries. Conservative MP Sir Liam Fox said in the House of Commons last week: ''If such a barrier was required, why was it not introduced earlier in the outbreak, and if it is a contingency measure against a so-called second wave, why apply it to countries with a lower infection rate than we already have?"" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, suggests bringing in the policy ""would have had some effect"" during the ""containment phase"" of the virus response back in February. But he argues that bringing it in now ""won't have any measurable impact on public health whatsoever"". In late February and early March, the government did advise passengers from affected areas, such as Wuhan in China and parts of Italy, to self-isolate when arriving in the UK, but this policy was dropped on 13 March. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said at the government's coronavirus press conference that ""measures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and applied to countries with higher rates"". There was some confusion over whether these travel quarantine rules would apply to the whole of the UK, because border security is a centralised measure, while health is devolved - meaning England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland set their own rules. Ultimately the measure was brought in as part of the Public Health Act, so when the UK government decided to introduce quarantine rules on 3 June they were for England only. All home nations have now made it a requirement for travellers from abroad to quarantine for 14 days upon entering the UK. But they could choose to end the policy at different times, or to vary the rules. For example, workers providing essential healthcare will have to quarantine upon arrival in Scotland but not in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. The level of fines issued for breaking the rules also vary. In Scotland, if someone fails to self-isolate for 14 days at a fixed address they will be fined £480, while in England, Wales and Northern Ireland it's £1,000. In England, an individual will be fined £100 for not filling out the contact locator form correctly. In the rest of the UK the fine is £60, falling to £30 if paid promptly. There has been a lot of discussion about so-called ""air bridges"", which could allow visitors from countries with low coronavirus transmission rates to enter the UK without having to self-isolate. For an air bridge to open, two countries would have to agree to relax quarantine restrictions. So far, Portugal is the only country offering to open an air bridge to the UK. Sources close to the government have told the BBC that the Department for Transport is keen to open air bridges by the end of the month. ""Quash the quarantine"", a lobbying group of more than 500 travel and hospitality companies, says it has been given ""private assurances"" from senior government sources that travel corridors - which encompass land, air and sea borders - will be in place by that time.

52,Coronavirus: What tests are being done in the UK?,"What are the tests for coronavirus, who are they for and how do they work?","Fri, 12 Jun 2020 16:20:56 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51943612,"Testing will be vital to controlling coronavirus outbreaks as lockdown eases. The government says tests are now available to anyone with symptoms, and it aims to process tests within 24 hours by the end of June. In England and Wales you can apply for a swab test for yourself, or for anyone in your household, if you or they have symptoms In Northern Ireland and Scotland anyone over the age of five with symptoms can get tested. People working or living in care homes can be tested even if they don't have symptoms. The test finds out if you currently have the virus. It involves taking a swab up the nose and the back of the throat, which can be done by the person themselves or someone else. These tests won't show if you have had Covid-19 in the past. Antibody tests - which do look for evidence of past exposure - use blood samples. The UK now has capacity for 40,000 antibody tests a day, but these are only offered to health and care staff. Couriers collect samples and take them to laboratories. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June, except where there were difficulties with the post. Baroness Dido Harding, the head of the Test and Trace service, has previously said 84% of drive-in centre tests come back within a day. No figure has been provided for home kits. Speed is important because delays give the virus more time to spread. Scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. This can be because the swab sample wasn't good enough, the stage of infection someone's at when tested, or problems in the lab. The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, has called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Testing is essential if contact-tracing systems now in place across the UK are to work effectively, help stop the spread of the virus and avoid the need for UK-wide lockdowns. And in theory it can help people, including NHS workers, know whether they are safe to go to work. But representatives of hospital trusts and care home providers say staff need to be tested regularly, not as a one-off, to ensure this. Testing can also let the health service plan for extra demand, and inform government decisions around social distancing. People who test positive for Covid-19 will be told to self-isolate for 14 days - and their recent close contacts will be traced and told to do the same, even if they don't have symptoms. Close contacts include household members and anyone who has been within 2m of the positive person for more than 15 minutes. Read more about contact tracing in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. During the coronavirus epidemic, the government has been challenged over its testing capacity and the data presented at daily briefings. On 7 June, Matt Hancock announced the UK had exceeded its target to increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. But only about 115,000 tests were actually carried out in the 24 hours to 09:00 BST that day - and that figure includes testing kits posted out to homes, some of which may never be returned. It also includes tests carried out as part of a surveillance study by the Office for National Statistics, which don't serve the purpose of diagnosing individuals. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority criticised the presentation of the daily figures, saying they appeared to be aimed at showing ""the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Some people are tested more than once - either to prove they no longer have Covid-19, or because a negative result appears incorrect given their symptoms, or because the first test didn't work. A government spokesperson said it was working with statisticians and that the approach throughout had been to ""increase transparency"". There are several options. You can travel to a drive-through testing site, visit a mobile testing unit or get a home testing kit delivered. Testing at an NHS facility, such as a hospital, is available for patients and some NHS workers. Follow Rachel on Twitter Have you been tested? Or are you waiting for a test?

53,Can thermal cameras help spot coronavirus?,"The devices allow a person's temperature to be checked from a distance, but are not always reliable.","Tue, 09 Jun 2020 00:48:41 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52940951,"As lockdowns ease, thermal imaging cameras are popping up in all sorts of public places to assess the state of people's health. Using infrared technology, thermal cameras detect radiating heat from a body - usually from the forehead - and then estimate core body temperature. These cameras are an extremely powerful tool, often deployed by fire fighters to track smouldering embers and police to search for out-of-sight suspects. But they are not designed to be medical devices. So how useful are they in the current pandemic? They can give a reasonable measure of skin temperature, to within half a degree - but that's not the same as body temperature. ""These devices, in general, are less accurate than medical device thermometers like those you stick in the ear,"" says Derek Hill, professor of medical imaging science from University College London. About 37C (98.6F). A high temperature is usually considered to be 38C or over. But normal temperature can vary from person to person and change during the day. It can also fluctuate during a woman's monthly cycle. Taking an accurate reading of core body temperature isn't easy. Although it can be measured on the forehead, in the mouth, the ear and the armpit, the most accurate way is to take a rectal reading.  37°C(98.6°F) normal body temperature 38°C(100.4°F) or above, high temperature/fever No, they only measure temperature. A high temperature or fever is just one common symptom of the virus. Others include nausea, headaches, fatigue and loss of taste or smell. But not everyone with the virus gets a high temperature and not everyone with a high temperature is infected with coronavirus. So thermal cameras alone will miss infected people with other symptoms or no symptoms at all - known as false negatives. They will also identify people unwell with a fever for another reason - known as false positives. On its own, temperature screening ""may not be very effective"" says the World Health Organization. Cameras have to be set up correctly and take account of ambient temperature. A risk is that cameras can lull operators into a false sense of security. ""They are… only one tool among many,"" says James Ferryman, professor of computational vision, from the University of Reading. ""Heat radiating from the skin will likely be impacted by wearing face masks,"" says Prof Ferryman. That's why most temperature measurements are based on the forehead, which is usually exposed. Not necessarily. Skin temperature actually goes down during exercise as sweat appears on the surface of the skin. The body is pretty good at regulating its temperature even after exercise, so it would have to be really quite high to show up. With portable thermometers pointed at foreheads. They don't need to touch the skin, but do need to be within a few centimetres of it. While accurate to a fraction of a degree on skin temperature, they correctly detect fever about 90% of the time compared with a rectal thermometer, Prof Hill says. Thermal scanners are now in place at some UK airports - including Bournemouth. Temperature screening is being trialled for some passengers at Heathrow, while Manchester Airport says equipment is also being tested - but results will not be communicated to passengers or ""used to influence whether a customer can travel"". Portsmouth international ferry port has also installed a thermal scanner to screen departing passengers. Schools are deploying hand-held laser thermometers to check children each morning. And some employers are looking at introducing staff-testing in workplaces. Under UK employment law, individuals must agree before an employer can temperature-screen members of staff. Some work contracts will already allow for this type of test to be carried out, by so-called ""implied consent"". If employees do not consent - and there is no pre-agreed policy covering the situation - then taking someone's temperature is unlawful, says the professional body for HR and people development. Employers must also handle the medical information they gather fairly and transparently - according to the Information Commissioner. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean?"
54,Coronavirus: How to make your own face mask,Our guide to different types of face coverings and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.,"Thu, 04 Jun 2020 16:22:43 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52609777,"People across the country are being advised to wear face coverings in certain circumstances when out of the house, to help limit the spread of coronavirus. From 15 June, you must wear one on public transport in England. While medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering, wherever you live. Here's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them. Whether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably. One study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home. Let's start with a simple one. The government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings. Our next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew. Homemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms. If you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home. Whichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home. Our third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes. There are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks. Have fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed. Face coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.

55,Coronavirus: Are protests legal amid lockdown?,Black Lives Matter protests continue in the UK - but are they illegal under restrictions on gatherings?,"Mon, 08 Jun 2020 11:27:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52909814,"Protests against the death of George Floyd, the black man who died while being restrained by a Minnesota police officer, have taken place in the UK, organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter. This is despite Home Secretary Priti Patel and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick asking people not to go on to the streets. So are such demonstrations actually legal given the coronavirus lockdown? England now has the loosest lockdown in the UK, with no restrictions on going outside. But the rules (officially known as regulations) don't explicitly say anything about protests. However, regulation seven restricts public gatherings to no more than six people. The law defines a ""gathering"" as a meeting involving ""social interaction with each other, or to undertake any other activity"". And so that means, pretty clearly, that a protest is currently illegal along with any other activity that could increase the virus's spread. ""There's a reason that we have laws in place temporarily to say that gatherings of over six people should not happen,"" says Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Police have been trying to encourage people to follow the law and the public health message, and they can break up gatherings. Before Mr Floyd's death, this tended to mean officers directing large parties to stop and ordering people to go home - such as with this rave in the West Midlands last month. Officers can hand out fixed-penalty notices - a form of on-the-spot ticket - that start at £100 to anyone who won't follow the health regulations. They can also arrest and charge someone with an offence, potentially leading to a large fine in a magistrates' court. So taking all that together, officers have the power to break up and ticket people for being part of a protest, on coronavirus health grounds. Yes, but this is where it gets rather tricky because that right is often misunderstood. And the coronavirus health emergency has complicated things further. Barrister Audrey Cherryl Mogan explains the European Convention on Human Rights (in British law as the Human Rights Act) says that public bodies must respect both the right to assemble and to express one's views. But these two rights are not absolute. The government or another public body can interfere with them if it has a proper legal reason to do so. ""So it becomes a balancing exercise,"" she says. ""If what's being done is to enforce the health regulations, then you can argue that [stopping a protest] would be reasonable and proportionate."" Ms Mogan argues the police should approach these protests in the same way that officers would consider a park full of sunbathing friends. ""If we are talking about stopping a protest, there has to be a fair and just application of the law to these people."" If not, she warns, closing down a Black Lives Matter protest on coronavirus grounds could be seen as unfair and a disproportionate use of the regulations. Chief constables today talk about their public duty to ""facilitate"" demonstrations - and say that they only turn to force - such as bringing in riot police - if they have to quell trouble. And over the first weekend in June, it was pretty clear that the police didn't want to break up peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations even though, on paper at least, they would breach coronavirus laws. Dame Cressida and other police chiefs had asked people not to come out and protest on the streets. She said that: ""Coming together in a gathering is not only unlawful but also, perhaps more importantly, it is putting yourself and your family at unnecessary risk and other people around you."" She said officers, if faced with large gatherings, would seek to uphold the law but would make ""a case-by-case decision"" as to what was the right thing to do. Some of the organisers of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations argued over the weekend that they were completely justified in asking people to protest. They said it was because racism - and the violence that comes with it - is like a virus that can only be combatted and defeated by taking a stand. England and Manchester City striker Raheem Sterling summed up that sentiment in a BBC interview, saying: ""The only disease right now is the racism that we are fighting."" So, in short, many protesters believe that it is their duty to come out and have their say - and that their decision should be recognised as a lawful and reasonable excuse to be out on the streets."
56,Coronavirus: What are the rules on weddings?,There is a lot of uncertainty around when and how weddings are allowed to take place. What are your rights?,"Fri, 05 Jun 2020 14:20:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52811509,"About 250,000 weddings take place in the UK each year - adding an estimated £10bn to the economy. Ceremonies this year have been devastated by coronavirus, but Northern Ireland will allow small outdoors weddings from Monday. There is no official word yet about the rest of the UK. If yours was cancelled, or you are thinking about postponing, what are your rights? Only in exceptional circumstances. The prime minister banned weddings and christenings when lockdown started on 23 March, and that guidance is still in effect. However, the government is looking into allowing small weddings to take place again in England. This may be as soon as June, but bigger celebrations are unlikely to be permitted until later on. Weddings in Wales and Scotland are also currently on hold. Northern Ireland has allowed weddings to take place if one partner is terminally ill, and will allow outdoors weddings with 10 people present from 8 June. Some English councils have been granted emergency powers to allow weddings where one partner is ill. If your wedding cannot take place, or you feel it will be too different from the day you wanted, it is generally better to postpone rather than cancel it. Check alternative dates with your venue as soon as possible, and then ask your suppliers if they would also be able to switch. Couples ''do need to be understanding of what venues and suppliers are going through at the moment"", says Henrietta Dunkley of Ellis Jones Solicitors. She specialises in dispute resolution, and is due to get married in August. Many venues and suppliers are likely to have lost significant sums of money, so try to find a solution that works for everyone, she advises. For example, if the wedding was on a Friday or Saturday or in peak season and the venue can't offer an equivalent date, it's generally reasonable to ask for a fee reduction, or an upgrade in the service you will receive. If your ceremony was due while weddings were banned, you should generally be entitled to a full refund if you don't want to postpone. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says in most cases this would be if: An exception is the costs a business has incurred on your behalf already, such as a wedding meal tasting or a dress fitting. As a result, venues and suppliers may be entitled to keep all or part of your deposit, but consumer rights law states they must give you a breakdown of costs. If your wedding is coming up and may technically be allowed to take place, that's where things become trickier. Read the small print in your contract to check the rules on cancellation or date changes of the businesses you are using. And then ask them what they are prepared to offer. Under consumer rights law, contract clauses that could be deemed unfair may be unenforceable, even if you previously agreed to them. Any ''non-refundable'' deposit can only have been a small percentage of the total price. Most wedding insurance does not cover a ''government act"", so it is unlikely to pay out if the lockdown affected your wedding. A few wedding insurers are paying out now under some circumstances. For example, John Lewis suggests it will refund you if restrictions mean your wedding cannot be held and you can demonstrate you have tried to recoup the money from your venue and suppliers. Many, if not all insurers are not selling new wedding policies, so this only covers existing agreements. If not, you may have to register a claim with the administrator or can claim up to £30,000 per supplier from your credit card company for services not rendered, under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. If you paid on debit card you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Businesses are not allowed to profiteer from the pandemic, meaning they cannot just hike up their prices. Ms Dunkley says some couples have found venues are charging them far more for a postponed wedding than if they tried to book the same date as a new customer. This is unlikely to be deemed reasonable. However, she adds it is fair for an equivalent wedding in 2021 to cost slightly more, because of inflation - the rise in costs for goods and services over time - and to reflect an increase in supply costs. The CMA has set up a taskforce to investigate harmful pricing practices during the pandemic. Consumers can fill in this form if they feel a business has treated them unfairly. Some insurance policies will pay out if your supplier or venue goes bust."
57,Coronavirus: Why are international comparisons difficult?,Should you be comparing Covid-19 statistics between countries?,"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:24:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52311014,"Everyone wants to know how well their country is tackling the coronavirus pandemic, compared with others. But there are all sorts of challenges in comparing countries, such as how widely they test for Covid-19 and whether they count deaths from the virus in the same way. Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter from Cambridge University has said trying to rank different countries to decide which is the worst in Europe is a ""completely fatuous exercise"". But he's also referred to ""the bad countries in Europe: UK, Belgium, France, Spain, Italy"" and said ""clearly it's important to note that group is way above, in terms of their mortality, a group like Germany, Austria, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, who have low fatality rates."" So, when it comes to comparing countries, what factors do you need to take into account? First of all, there are differences in how countries record Covid-19 deaths. France and Germany, for example, have been including deaths in care homes in the headline numbers they produce every day. But the daily figures for England referred only to deaths in hospitals until 29 April, when they started factoring in deaths in care homes as well. A further complication is that there is no accepted international standard for how you measure deaths, or their causes. Does somebody need to have been tested for coronavirus to count towards the statistics, or are the suspicions of a doctor enough? Germany counts deaths in care homes only if people have tested positive for the virus. Belgium, on the other hand, includes any death in which a doctor suspects coronavirus was involved. The UK's daily figures only count deaths when somebody has tested positive for the virus, but its weekly figures include suspected cases. Also, does the virus need to be the main cause of death, or does any mention on a death certificate count? Again, different countries do things differently. So, are you really comparing like with like? There is a lot of focus on death rates, but there are different ways of measuring them too. One is the ratio of deaths to confirmed cases - of all the people who test positive for coronavirus, how many go on to die? But different countries are testing in different ways. Early in the outbreak, the UK mainly tested people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital. That can make the death rate appear much higher than in a country with a wider testing programme. The more testing a country carries out, the more it will find people who have coronavirus with only mild symptoms, or perhaps no symptoms at all. In other words, the death rate in confirmed cases is not the same as the overall death rate. Another measurement is how many deaths have occurred compared with the size of a country's population - the numbers of deaths per million people, for example. But that is determined partly by what stage of the outbreak an individual country has reached. If a country's first case was early in the global outbreak, then it has had longer for its death toll to grow. One way to take account of that is to look at how a country has done since reaching a particular point in the pandemic - the day it recorded its 50th death for example. But even that poses some problems. A country that reaches 50 deaths later should have had more time to prepare for the virus and to reduce the eventual death toll. It is also worth emphasising, when studying these comparisons, that most people who get infected with coronavirus will recover. There are other factors to take into account beyond the numbers themselves. It is more difficult to have confidence in data that comes from countries with tightly controlled political systems. Is the number of deaths recorded so far in countries like China or Iran accurate? We don't really know. Calculated as a number of deaths per million of its population, China's figures are extraordinarily low, even after it revised upwards the death toll in Wuhan by 50%. So, can we really trust the data? There are real differences in the populations in different countries. Demographics are particularly important - that's things like average age, or where people live. Comparisons have been made between the UK and the Republic of Ireland, but they are problematic. Ireland has a much lower population density, and a much larger percentage of people live in rural areas. It makes more sense to compare Dublin City and County with an urban area in the UK of about the same size (like Merseyside) than to try to compare the two countries as a whole. Similarly, a better though still imperfect comparison for London, Europe's major global city, may be with New York, the biggest global hub in the United States. You also need to make sure you are comparing like with like in terms of age structure. A comparison of death rates between countries in Europe and Africa wouldn't necessarily work, because countries in Africa tend to have much younger populations. We know that older people are much more likely to die of Covid-19. On the other hand, most European countries have health systems that are better funded than those in most African countries. And that will also have an effect on how badly hit a country is by coronavirus, as will factors such as how easily different cultures adjust to social distancing. Health systems obviously play a crucial role in trying to control a pandemic, but they are not all the same. ""Do people actively seek treatment, how easy is it to get to hospitals, do you have to pay to be treated well? All of these things vary from place to place,"" says Prof Andy Tatem, of the University of Southampton. Another big factor is the level of comorbidity - this means the number of other conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease or high blood pressure - which people may already have when they get infected. Countries that did a lot of testing early in the pandemic, and followed it up by tracing the contacts of anyone who was infected, seem to have been most successful in slowing the spread of the disease so far. Both Germany and South Korea have had far fewer deaths than the worst affected countries. The number of tests per head of population may be a useful statistic to predict lower fatality rates. But not all testing data is the same - some countries record the number of people tested, while others record the total number of tests carried out (many people need to be tested more than once to get an accurate result). The timing of testing, and whether tests took place mostly in hospitals or in the community, also need to be taken into account. Germany and South Korea tested aggressively very early on, and learned a lot more about how the virus was spreading. But Italy, which has also done a lot of tests, has suffered a relatively high numbers of deaths.  Italy only substantially increased its capacity for testing after the pandemic had already taken hold. The UK has done the same thing. So, is anything useful likely to emerge from all these comparisons? ""What you want to know is why one country might be doing better than another, and what you can learn from that,"" says Prof Jason Oke from the University of Oxford. ""And testing seems to be the most obvious example so far."" But until this outbreak is over it won't be possible to know for sure which countries have dealt with the virus better. ""That's when we can really learn the lessons for next time,"" says Prof Oke. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate? Get in touch Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"
58,Can superspreading be stopped?,"Identifying superspreading events could be crucial in the fight against the virus, scientists say.","Sat, 06 Jun 2020 07:16:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52903787,"As the world races to find treatments and vaccines for coronavirus, scientists have another target in their sights - the superspreading event, when one person infects many others. And there is a new number that's key to understanding why that happens. During the pandemic, there has been a focus on the reproduction or R number. This is the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average. However, not every person with coronavirus passes it on to the same number of people. Some may self-isolate and infect nobody, while others go about their life and infect many people. This is where the k number is useful. It measures the difference in how many people each person with coronavirus infects. The smaller the k number is, the lower the number of people who are transmitting the disease to others is. This means more superspreaders, each individually infecting higher numbers of people. About 10-15% of people are responsible for about 80% of infections, according to an expert. Dr Adam Kucharski, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), says: ""Typically, what happens is a lot of people don't give the infection to anyone. ""And then there's a handful of events where you see large amounts of transmission happening with five, 10, 20 people potentially infected. And we saw that even quite early on with Covid."" Covid-19 is passed on through people shedding virus particles from their bodies. How infectious someone is depends on many factors that differ dramatically from person to person, including: But it is what they do when they are at their most infectious that really drives superspreading events. ""If someone, when they're most transmissible, happens to go to an all-day meeting with a large number of people, and then go out for dinner afterwards, you may well see a superspreading event,"" Dr Kucharski says. ""If that person happened to have an evening at home, it might not have generated any transmission."" Scientists have been keeping track of clusters of Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Dr Gwen Knight, from LSHTM, says: ""We found that many of the settings are what we expected. ""So care settings - hospitals and care homes - unfortunately, are coming up. ""And also cruise ships, which is something we know from other infectious diseases."" But she also found clusters repeatedly appearing in other places - meat-processing plants, choirs, bars and gyms. All of these involve being indoors, in close contact with others, for prolonged periods of time. But Dr Knight says there is another common thread. ""These settings are likely to be loud settings, and obviously, that has an impact on the kind of breathing you do,"" she says. ""There is the hypothesis that because it's loud, and you're expelling more or faster air, it could be this that makes the setting more and more risky. ""There were several clusters linked to fitness classes in South Korea, and more were linked to Zumba classes than to pilates classes. ""So it might be that you're engaged in an exercise that requires you to breathe more heavily and deeper, as opposed to a more gentle breathing, for example."" Dr Muge Cevik, of the University of St Andrews, says: ""Not all activities, not all environments have the same risk of infection. ""So, for example, the risk of infection would be higher indoors compared to outdoors. ""Outdoors, generally people worry about cyclists or runners passing by - but that would be lower risk. We could say the transmission risk is negligible. ""Whereas if you spend a whole day together, in a big group in a park, and if you exchange lots of food and you have really close contact, less than 2m (6ft), the risk is lower than being indoors - but there is still risk."" Hand-washing, social distancing and not sharing utensils is essential, she says. Strict lockdowns were a blunt tool for halting the spread of coronavirus. But as infections decrease, and the world opens up, scientists say a more targeted approach is needed, Dr Cevik says: ""We need to understand the transmission dynamics so we can concentrate our contact-tracing focus. ""But if we can avoid these superspreading events, and the environments and activities associated with them, you can decrease almost 80% of infections. ""And that's huge."" Follow Rebecca on Twitter"

60,Coronavirus: How dangerous is lifting lockdown?,"Why is lifting restrictions being described as a ""dangerous moment""?","Mon, 01 Jun 2020 23:57:25 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52878816,"Lockdown is starting to ease. Across the UK we can meet more people, while in England some children are back in school and car showrooms and open-air markets have reopened. But some scientists, even those advising government, have been in mutinous mood - saying ministers are acting too soon. And the lifting of restrictions has been described as a ""dangerous moment"" even by England's deputy chief medical officer. Things are far better than when lockdown came in. There were an estimated 100,000 new infections every day in England on 23 March, the day when Boris Johnson announced strict curbs on our daily lives. That compares with around 8,000 daily infections at the moment. ""It's somewhere in the range of 10-fold fewer, but that's still considerable,"" Dr Adam Kurcharski from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told the BBC. The speed at which the virus is spreading is also much slower. The R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus onto - was around three when lockdown came in. That meant 10 people were passing coronavirus onto 30 others. Now the R is around 0.7-0.9, meaning 10 people would be expected to pass it onto around eight others. However, a comparison by the University of Oxford suggests the UK is in one of the worst positions globally for exiting lockdown. And it is notable the government's own coronavirus alert system for England remains at ""Level 4"" rather than ""Level 3"" when social distancing restrictions would be relaxed. The chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warns there is ""not a lot of room"" for manoeuvre and the data ""urges caution"". R is close to one - the tipping point where cases increase again and ""we are still seeing new infections every day at quite a significant rate"". Relaxing lockdown means we will come into contact with more people and that increases the opportunity for the virus to spread. The restrictions being eased are expected to have a small role in spreading coronavirus, but their precise impact is unknown. Uncertainty is a particular issue with schools. The government's evidence on reopening them could not put a figure on the impact. There is also uncertainty about how we will react to the loosening of the rules. Behavioural scientists advising the government already estimate only half of people are isolating for seven days when they become sick. Throughout the pandemic, the scientists and politicians have been following the same script. But there is now a clear, loud and public split between some of those advising government and those ""following the science"". More than a dozen Sage committee members, who advise government, have spoken out, saying we should wait until test and trace is fully working and cases have come down. ""Essentially, we're lifting the lid on a boiling pan and it's just going to bubble over,"" argued Prof Calum Semple. There is a significant consequence to lifting lockdown now - it may lock us into the current number of cases. There are approximately 8,000 infections a day. If easing restrictions raises the R number close to one, then we will continue to have around 8,000 infections every day. Waiting until cases fall further would make the virus easier to control and give more time to react if there was a ""second wave"". However, that requires keeping a painful lockdown for longer. There is also uncertainty about how effective contact tracing will be in the UK. The aim is to replace lockdown for all with isolation for some, by rapidly identifying and quarantining anyone who comes into close contact with someone infected. The strategy is seen as one of the key reasons some Asian countries have excelled at controlling coronavirus (South Korea has around 270 deaths compared with more than 39,000 in the UK). However, there is a danger in expecting identical results. The UK is not using GPS tracking to ensure people do as they are told, like South Korea, or taking people to quarantine centres as they do in Hong Kong. Speed is crucial in order to find contacts before they become infectious, yet there are concerns about how long home testing takes in the UK. And an analysis of South Korea's strategy, by Imperial College London, suggests mass testing when a cluster of cases appears in one area was more influential than tracing contacts. Estimates of the effectiveness of test and trace vary widely, from a 5% to a 30% reduction in infections, depending on how optimistic the number crunching. The number of people that have been infected remains low, so any immunity is also low. That means there is the potential for a second wave, but whether it happens depends on both government decisions and how we react. The plan is to gradually introduce measures and then monitor what happens. ""With a cautious, piecemeal approach, I think the risk of a major increase is not particularly high; let's not call it a second wave, let's call it a second bump,"" said Prof Mark Woolhouse from the University of Edinburgh. A sudden surge in cases is considered unlikely. Dr Kucharski said: ""I don't think we'll see a huge, exponential increase in numbers in a couple of weeks. ""It may take some time for that to happen if transmission is in clusters; it will be late summer or autumn or even winter, depending on what happens. It may be we're in for a long haul.""

61,Coronavirus: Why we don't know how many are being tested,The UK Statistics Authority has criticised the government's handling of Covid-19 testing data.,"Tue, 02 Jun 2020 16:47:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52891611,"The government has not published the number of people tested for coronavirus since 22 May. It's also been criticised for not detailing who was swabbed - staff, patients or those isolating at home. The UK Statistics Authority chairman has written to the Health Secretary Matt Hancock, saying the published official figures are ""far from complete and comprehensible"". The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the publication of headline figures on the number of people tested had ""temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting"". Testing has been a key measure of government performance in handling the outbreak. Making sure supply could meet demand was one of the five criteria the prime minister said needed to be met before easing lockdown. And the government acknowledges testing strategically will be vital as lockdown restrictions ease. But as the programme has expanded, it has become increasingly difficult to interpret and scrutinise the official data. ""People tested"" is a helpful separate indicator since the number of tests carried out does not tell you how many individuals have accessed a test. On 22 May, when the data for people was last published, 140,497 tests were carried out on 80,297 people. The gap between tests and people tested can be explained by a variety of things. Some people needed a second swab because their first was not good enough to give a conclusive result. People with ""void"" or unclear results were sent a new test. Up to 19 May, 8% of tests carried out at drive-through and pop-up testing sites were inconclusive. The figure for home test kits was not provided. There are also good clinical reasons to retest someone - to check whether someone who has previously tested positive is now negative, or to double check a negative result in someone who still has symptoms. On top of this, people tested as part of a surveillance study to estimate the level of infection in the population as a whole were counted in the tests, but not the people tested, figures. The latest round of Office for National Statistics surveillance testing for the period 27 April-10 May involved 10,705 participants. Together, surveillance swab and antibody testing, which are important but aren't used to diagnose people individually, accounted for almost 30,000 of the just under 130,000 tests carried out on 30 May. All of these factors mean there are more tests processed than people given a result. The government has not provided figures on how many individual people received more than one test for each of these reasons, so we can't tell how much each one accounts for the discrepancy between tests and people tested. Another possible explanation for the gap is that certain groups of people (like health and care staff, and care home residents) are being tested regularly. The DHSC was not able to clarify how people who were tested on several different occasions would be counted - as one ""person tested"" or many. A spokesperson did refer to a ""small percentage of cases where the same person has had more than one test"", suggesting routine testing may be limited. An Imperial College London study, by the same modelling group that has informed much of the government's response, said in April that NHS staff should be tested weekly even if they didn't have symptoms. This need for routine testing has been echoed by NHS Providers, the body representing hospital trusts. And Nadra Ahmed, chairwoman of the National Care Association, which represents independent care providers, said routine testing in care homes was ""just not happening"". On 28 April Health Secretary Matt Hancock said care home staff and residents could be routinely tested even if they didn't have symptoms. But Ms Ahmed described this as ""smoke and mirrors"". She said she had heard from providers around the country who had requested batches of tests for their staff and residents, and were still waiting 14 days later. Some hadn't even been able to test their staff and residents once, while others were struggling to get onto the portal. The UK Statistics Authority particularly criticised the inclusion of home kits posted out, but not yet returned, in the number of tests. Its chairman, Sir David Norgrove, accused the government of using the data to ""show the largest possible number of tests, even at the expense of understanding"". Although the DHSC reached its target of providing 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, it has not published data on how many were actually used and returned. After setting the 100,000 tests a day target, the government moved its focus away from the number of people tested. In fact, when it came to the ""people tested"" figures, home kits only showed up in the data once received back for processing in the lab. This may account for some of the gap but, again, we can't say how much. This in itself appeared to be a source of confusion - even within the department. Guidance on the website initially said tests done at home or at a pop-up testing centre run by the armed forces did not contribute towards the ""people tested"" figure. But this note was later taken off the website. A DHSC spokesperson said these tests were only counted as ""people tested"" at the point of being analysed in the lab, and that the note was removed ""to avoid confusion"". Follow Rachel on Twitter"
62,Social distancing: A practical guide to how to socialise now,Meeting friends? Here's how to handle the awkward new rules - from sharing food to avoiding hugs.,"Sat, 30 May 2020 08:43:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52848793,"The UK is starting to relax its coronavirus lockdown rules, meaning some of us can now see friends and family we have been separated from for months. Under the new rules: We asked doctor and TV presenter Xand van Tulleken for his thoughts on ensuring our gatherings are as safe as possible. Details of the rules vary across the UK, so if you are living outside of England some of the advice below may not apply to you. The first thing to do is think about who you're inviting and what pressures that invitation will put on them - we are very differently vulnerable to this virus. If you're inviting overweight men who are older, they face a very different risk to young families with young children. If you're inviting people who've had the virus that's very different again. Think about the invitation and think about who you're putting at risk. If you're thinking of inviting a 70-year-old overweight man, I would consider having quite a detailed conversation about the risks they were prepared to accept. If you're shielding you obviously cannot attend these gatherings. If you are hosting an event and people can get into the garden directly, brilliant. If they can't and people are walking through the house, it would be reasonable to tell them to wear a mask, wash their hands when they get into the house, and then go straight into the garden. They shouldn't touch anything. You need to get them to the garden as quickly as possible. To maintain social distancing, about a quarter of a tennis court is what you need for a six-person gathering if everyone is from different households, which is massive. If you had 12 two-metre by two-metre picnic blankets, you would each need to sit at the intersections where the blankets meet to guarantee that you're two metres away from the other people in your group and two metres away from passersby. I don't expect everyone's got 12 picnic blankets but that is at least the distances that we're talking about. You need to find some way of measuring. You could get a two-metre pole, a bamboo cane, a tape measure or a broom or whatever you can improvise with, hold it and spin around in a circle - everyone needs to be able to do that without knocking into each other. In your garden, you could mark two metres out with blankets, chalk or masking tape to create little zones for people - no-one from separate households should be sitting next to one another on a bench. When we talk about gardens, I look at mine and it's a very small space. To have more than two people in it socially distanced would be impossible. In terms of bringing your own cutlery, it's difficult. Everyone through these sets of guidelines is going to have to determine how much risk they're prepared to accept. If you think you've had coronavirus and/or you're low risk, meaning you're young, you're slim, you're female - those are the main variables - your behaviour at a picnic is probably going to be much more relaxed with regards to things like sharing the potato salad and using other people's cutlery. But of course you need to be doing everything you can to stop yourself being a carrier and making other people ill. If you are a man who's older and overweight and don't think you've had the virus, I would say bring your own cutlery and bring your own coleslaw. If you're in the park you might not be able to wash your hands, so I would say bring hand gel, wipes and perhaps water to wash your hands with or identify a sink nearby. If you're having people in your garden, you need to do everything you can to signal to them that things are not back to normal and to help them feel safe and you feel safe. You could ask your guests to set their alarms for every 45 minutes or every hour in a staggered way, then everyone could wash their hands when their alarm goes off. If you're hosting, say to everyone ""we're all going to wash our hands once an hour"". You could also have a sign somewhere in the toilet that says ""wash your hands"". There needs to be at least two minutes between people using the toilet. You should flush with the seat down - a lot of people don't bother with this but the spray from the toilet generates an aerosol and there is coronavirus in bodily fluids. Once you flush, then you need to wipe down the loo. You need either disinfectant wipes in the loo, or you need a spray with some disposable towels. You also need a fresh hand towel for everyone drying their hands so you're not re-contaminating from the usual hand towel that hangs in the bathroom. You want a pile of disposable towels and you want a large quantity of soap available in the bathroom. All the surfaces need to be wiped down. Even then, remember it's not a risk-free zone. Probably the toilet paper is going to be contaminated - you are definitely taking a risk by doing this. You're not allowed to hug people and that's the rule. But in my experience, if a small child wants a hug, it's virtually impossible to stop them. For people with nieces, nephews, grandchildren, godchildren or other important children in their lives who they haven't been able to see for a long time, if you're going to a picnic in their garden, it's going to be quite difficult to avoid contact. I would say, if you do end up having a hug at least don't grab the person and pull them into your face. A proper full-frontal hug is the most dangerous, but a child hugging your leg is much less dangerous. The only safe advice though is not to hug. You should do anything you can do to signal that this is not a normal gathering. You are having a picnic or gathering at a time of a deadly serious disease circulating widely in the population. We still have a high level of transmission in the UK. Alcohol does break down inhibitions and people get much more tactile when they're drunk. The other thing is the time limit. If you spend all afternoon in the garden with people drinking, that's wildly different to coming over and saying we're going to sit two metres apart for an hour and we'll wear a mask on the way in. Anything you can do to flag to people that this is not a normal gathering will make you and them feel safer. The virus either moves through the air, or it moves through droplets coming out of people's mouths and landing on surfaces and people touching those droplets. I would get out your household cleaning products and wipe down all surfaces once people have left. This virus is unpredictable and dangerous - significantly more dangerous than other viruses that circulate in the UK. We have to have quite a high level of paranoia about it."
63,Lockdoon's naw fur me: Schoolgirl's cheeky poem gets FM approval,Schoolgirl Leah Begg's funny lockdown poem has attracted the praise of Nicola Sturgeon.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:01:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53067673,"A Scottish schoolgirl who captured the essence of lockdown in Scotland has won the praise of the first minister for her writing. Leah Begg has been writing about her experience of the coronavirus restrictions and penned a cheeky take on living life between four walls. The 10-year-old has already had a poem published but this one caught the attention of Nicola Sturgeon. She wrote the youngster a letter to tell her how much she enjoyed it. The first minister wrote: ""Your words really do sum up the experience and frustrations of lockdown for many people. ""I know that you are finding it difficult not being able to go to school and will be missing friends and family. ""I know I am missing being able to hug my friends and family. I am very proud of how you all have been handling this difficult situation."" She also said that she hoped Leah would continue to write about her experiences in lockdown and in the future. Leah told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime with Fiona Stalker that the poem was her mum's idea. She said: ""I was in the house and my mum said why don't you write about how you are feeling in lockdown. So I did."" Leah's class teacher at Oxgang Primary in Kirkintilloch, Miss Nisbet, said: ""We are all so proud of Leah and think her poem is simply brilliant. ""She puts into words how many of us are feeling during this very strange time and does it so beautifully. ""She is very talented and often shares her poems and writings with us all and I have no doubt that her talent will see her go far. "" She added: ""To have received a letter from the first minister with such kind words about the poem, is a wonderful experience for Leah and another feather in her cap."""

James Bowen met Bob in 2007 during his battle with drug addiction when he found the cat abandoned and injured and decided to look after him. He began taking the ginger cat with him when busking or selling The Big Issue in London. Bowen eventually wrote a book about their relationship which became a smash hit and was made into a film, featuring Bob, in 2016. A Street Cat Named Bob: And How He Saved My Life was published in 2012, and there have since been five further books released in more than forty different languages. A second film, A Gift from Bob, which also features the eponymous feline, is due to be released later this year. Bowen credits his scarf-wearing companion with aiding his own recovery. In a statement on the official Facebook page for his books, the author said Bob had saved his life. ""It's as simple as that. He gave me so much more than companionship. With him at my side, I found a direction and purpose that I'd been missing."" ""He's met thousands of people, touched millions of lives. ""There's never been a cat like him. And never will again.

65,Coronavirus: How charity shops are handling the nation's spring clean,How charity shop staff are preparing to be on the receiving end of the great Covid clearout.,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:32:21 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-53082847,"The coronavirus lockdown has led to a national spring clean of epic proportions, with people stuck at home preparing to donate their unwanted goods. What does this mean for the charity shops on the receiving end of the Covid clearout? Tucked away on a small retail park on the edge of Shoeburyness, near Southend, Essex, is the Havens Hospices charity shop, brimming with colour and intrigue. ""We take anything,"" manager Eany Callahan says. ""Everything is money to us. We get money when we recycle, which is brilliant, so we don't say no to anything. ""I've had well over 100 calls in the past three days asking about donations and I've asked them to stagger them so we can cope."" But the drop-off-and-sort system has had to change, though. All donations are quarantined for three days before sale. Mr Callahan says items are ""processed, steamed and sprayed with disinfectant"" before reaching the shop floor. ""We've had lots of different things, from bric-a-brac to clothing,"" he adds. ""We've had very vintage items such as handbags, puzzles, games and books. ""In one case, we had more than 40 signed photos of the same person and we even had a sword donated, which I nearly got in trouble with the police for."" Among the packed racks and shelves is a new green sequinned dress, which will go on the hospice's eBay store. The price tag is £220 for the ""best dress in the shop"". However, even if it was being sold in the shop, a potential buyer wouldn't be able to try it on as the fitting rooms are closed off. There is also a limit on numbers, hand sanitizer for customers, a screen at the till and contactless payments.""We are asking everybody coming into the shop just to act sensibly,"" Mr Callahan adds. The store is one of 23 Havens Hospices shops, raising money for a charity that provides palliative and respite support for children, young people and adults across Essex. Financially, the charity is ""in a stable position until July, and then the future looks uncertain"" - when it is expected to lose 70% of its fundraising income. The Southend Half Marathon, which was cancelled on 14 June, would normally generate £200,000 alone. The charity's director of income generation, Trevor Johnson, said measures were in place ""to let our managers, staff and shoppers feel safe"". ""We wanted to be part of the community again and start raising funds but we could only do that if we had a proper plan. But the lockdown has affected staffing levels, with older volunteers and those shielding unable to return, while others had ""re-evaluated their priorities"" and stepped down. ""It's not a case of losing 14 people and recruiting 14,"" he said. Mother-of-three Kim Shambrook has worked in the shop for three years - and is currently the only volunteer there. ""The changes are a bit of a nightmare but they have to be done to keep ourselves and our customers safe. It's a massive difference,"" she said. ""We were used to a shop-load of people now it's just five at a time. And people want to pay cash."" She said she hoped the new way of working wouldn't put shoppers off. ""Please come - we need you,"" she said. Mr Johnson said it was too early to say how much money the charity's shops had lost during the lockdown, but he had been encouraged by Monday's trading figures. Charity shops need to adapt, he said, and this flexibility had become more important than ever. ""The pandemic has changed everything for everyone, but I do think there is still a place for charity shops as a social hub in the community."""
66,Premier League: Mystery over 'professional' haircuts,Fans are asking how some players managed to have such immaculate hairdos despite lockdown,"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 14:54:27 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-53096057,"Hawk Eye's fail isn't the only controversy from the return of the Premier League - the player's lockdown haircuts are also coming under close scrutiny. While some looked suitably shaggy - step forward Matteo Guendouzi and Matt Targett -  others looked surprisingly sharp. With most of us in the UK desperately waiting for the re-opening of hairdressers - fingers crossed on 4 July - some barbers felt a few of the barnets on show were amazingly professional. ""I was angry, I know a good haircut when I see one,"" says Steve, a barber in Norwich. He watched last night's matches paying close attention to the player's hair. He's had his chain of salons shut for months. There's no evidence any footballer's broken lockdown rules on trims, but it does beg the question - how did Arsenal's Sead Kolasinac or Man City's Gabriel Jesus manage such a smart do? ""You know, I feel they've approached certainly their wives and girlfriends,"" explains Steve. Is it me, or did all the footballers manage to perfectly cut their own hair during lockdown, or that their partners are all hairdressers? #footballsback ✂️🤷‍♂️ End of Twitter post  by @markrhysdavies ⚽️⚽️ so have all prem footballers got hair dressers for wives , most looking pretty sharp !!!

You know, a bit Rapunzel at the back with a hint of scarecrow at the sides. Aston Villa's Jack Grealish was freshly shaved at the back and sides - but on top his flowing locks had to be tucked away in a French plait. Arsenal's Aubameyang has let his hair grow - as has Aston Villa's Matt Targett who was wearing an Alice band to hold his mop back. None of the four clubs have commented yet on how their players were turned out. The Premier League has no regulation around haircuts and says Project Restart - aimed at football's comeback - is focusing entirely on the game. For hairdressers (and those of us who need a sheep shearer after three months) those sharp dos seemed to be a little galling. ""Barbers, like myself, are respecting the guidelines"" says Steve from Norwich. ""We're trying to gear up for 4 July at the earliest. We've been given some money from the government but the rent in my shops is very, very high and that money will run out."" My first questions about football: why is their hair so short?

67,The Trump administration's attempt to oust one of the most powerful prosecutors appears to be latest move to protect the President,The Trump administration's attempt to oust one of America's most powerful prosecutors raises fresh and glaring suspicions about its assault on the independence of the justice system and its respect for the rule of law that underpins constitutional governance.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:06:23 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/3eoe3uPZoAw/index.html,"The Trump administration's attempt to oust one of America's most powerful prosecutors raises fresh and glaring suspicions about its assault on the independence of the justice system and its respect for the rule of law that underpins constitutional governance. Attorney General William Barr's declaration he replaced Geoffrey Berman of the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York renewed the debate over the extent to which Barr is acting on President Donald Trump's interests rather than the nation's. The office of Berman, who is refusing to quit, is leading a probe into Trump's lawyer Rudolph Giuliani and associates and has also indicted a Turkish state-owned firm involved in an Iran sanctions-busting case which Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has raised with Trump. Scores of former Justice Department officials had already called for Barr to quit over a series of interventions that appear specifically designed to benefit Trump politically. Berman's refusal to go quietly meanwhile set off a new crisis and governmental showdown for an already reeling administration that is struggling to cope with a pandemic, a consequent economic crisis and a national reckoning on race. The President had been thinking of removing Berman for two years and believes that the investigation into Giuliani is an attempt to damage him politically, two sources told CNN's Kevin Liptak. But Friday night's dramatic events stoke fresh intrigue of exactly why Barr and Trump are suddenly so keen to oust Berman -- a Trump donor who was installed by the Trump administration in 2018 -- less than five months before the election. Berman, before walking into his office in downtown New York Saturday morning, told reporters, ""I issued a statement last night, I have nothing to add to that this morning. I'm just here to do my job."" Fundamentally, the episode reveals the extent to which a President with authoritarian impulses, who has worked constantly to challenge the justice system's independence and sought to force it to act in his own personal interests, is prepared to act with impunity in the wake of his Senate acquittal by fellow Republicans on impeachment charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. In recent weeks, Barr has ordered the clearing of protesters from Washington's Lafayette Square minutes before the President's controversial photo-op at a church. His department ditched the prosecution of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn -- who twice admitted lying to the FBI -- and attempted to reduce the sentencing recommendation for political fixer Roger Stone, another prominent Trump associate. One year ago, Barr may have saved Trump's presidency by shaping an impression of special counsel Robert Mueller's report in a way that was favorable to Trump -- before anyone could read the report. The President has meanwhile gutted top leadership of the FBI and the Justice Department in a way that suggests political motivation. More recently he has threatened to send regular troops into the streets to confront anti-racism demonstrations. And he has conducted a purge against inspectors general who are independent watchdog officials in government departments. The Berman controversy came at the moment when the President kicks his 2020 reelection campaign into high gear with a rally Saturday night in Oklahoma before a big crowd that defies Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations on stemming the pandemic. A 'Friday Night Massacre'? Extraordinary events over the fate of Berman were the latest disturbing echo of former Richard Nixon's ""Saturday Night Massacre"" when the then-President ordered his attorney general to fire special prosecutor Archibald Cox at the height of the Watergate scandal. Late on Friday evening -- the traditional dumping ground for controversial news stories -- Barr issued a press release announcing Berman's sudden resignation that said that he would be replaced by Jay Clayton, the head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has never served as a prosecutor. On its own, Barr's move was shocking since the Southern District of New York is one of the most prestigious and independent prosecutorial perches and typically handles highly sensitive financial, politically sensitive and terrorism cases. The fact that SDNY also investigated and convicted the President's personal lawyer Michael Cohen and is currently looking into Giuliani's financial and business affairs immediately raised the suspicion of conflicts of interests and political interference as well as new scrutiny over Barr's conduct and motivations. Adding to the intrigue is that Giuliani was the top federal prosecutor in New York during the 1980s. The New York federal prosecutor's office is also working on a number of cases to which it was referred by Mueller when he wrapped up his investigation into whether the Trump campaign knowingly cooperated with Russia's election interference operation. It named the President as ""Individual-1"" in its case against Cohen saying he directed campaign finance offenses related to the paying of hush money to several women who said they had affairs with Trump. The attempted firing of Berman ignited another conflagration in Washington with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, immediately announcing a hearing for Wednesday and inviting Berman to testify. ""America is right to expect the worst of Bill Barr, who has repeatedly interfered in criminal investigations on Trump's behalf,"" Nadler said in a statement. CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said late Friday that if it looked as though Barr was facilitating actions that would ""undermine the expedience ... or going forward of any cases it adds another log to the fire for people burning about their problems with this attorney general and his inability to boost or really contribute to morale and career prosecutors' ability to do their job."" Berman refuses to go An already massive confrontation exploded further when Berman, in a stunning move, issued his own late-night statement rebuking Barr over his decision to oust him and refusing to go, arguing that since he was technically appointed by a panel of judges on an acting basis in 2018, Barr has no power to force him out and that he would continue to serve. ""I learned in a press release from the Attorney General tonight that I was 'stepping down' as United States Attorney. I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,"" Berman said. ""I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption,"" he said. The chances of a new US Attorney for the Southern District of New York being confirmed much before the election seem slim and there is the possibility of legal battles over Berman's tenure. CNN legal analyst Paul Callan said: ""I think the President is going to have a great deal of difficulty in forcing Mr. Berman out of office because he came in under strange circumstances."" Berman's reference to those investigations immediately posed the question of whether he was speaking specifically about the general work of his department or to any cases that might interest Barr and Trump specifically. His defiance left next steps unclear but at the very least spoke to the remarkable chaos unleashed in the Justice Department under Trump which has intensified ever since Barr took over. CNN has reported rising tensions between Washington and Berman's office, including over some cases including the indictment of Turkish bank Halkbank. In his new book, former national security adviser John Bolton said that Trump told the Turkish strongman he would take ""care of things"" when he had replaced the prosecutors in New York with his own people.  The Justice Department and Berman did, however, bring a case against the Turkish bank in October 2019. The administration discussed replacing Berman with Ed O'Callaghan, a senior official last fall but the move was put on hold after prosecutor's indicted Guiliani's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, sources said. CNN's Erica Orden, Evan Perez, Kara Scannell and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."
68,US Attorney refuses to step down after Barr tries to push him out,"In a fast-escalating crisis Friday night, Attorney General William Barr tried to oust Geoffrey Berman, the powerful US attorney for the Southern District of New York who has investigated a number of associates of President Donald Trump, but Berman defied him by refusing to step down.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:02:53 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/DryCniAK6Ek/index.html,"Washington In a fast-escalating crisis Friday night, Attorney General William Barr tried to oust Geoffrey Berman, the powerful US attorney for the Southern District of New York who has investigated a number of associates of President Donald Trump, but Berman defied him by refusing to step down. In an extraordinary statement sent roughly an hour after Barr said Berman was set to leave the office, Berman said he had learned of his purported exit from a press release. ""I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position, to which I was appointed by the Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate,"" Berman said. ""Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption."" The standoff opens up a fresh crisis at the Justice Department, places the leadership of the most prominent federal prosecutors office outside Washington in a precarious position and again raises questions about Barr's willingness to steer the department to suit Trump's political agenda. Berman's rebuttal came about an hour after the Department of Justice announced Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, who has never been a prosecutor. A Justice Department official told CNN that Berman was offered other positions at Justice, including the head of the civil division, where assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt abruptly announced his departure this week. Berman declined. A second source with knowledge of the matter said Berman was asked to resign and refused. Barr asked Berman to resign in an in-person meeting in New York on Friday, the source said. Berman, before walking into his office in downtown New York Saturday morning, told reporters, ""I issued a statement last night, I have nothing to add to that this morning. I'm just here to do my job."" A late-night announcement The timing of the move, announced after 9 p.m. ET, immediately raised questions about the circumstances regarding Berman's departure. Any forced ouster of Berman is likely to draw scrutiny inside the US attorney's office and among career prosecutors. He has been the US attorney for Manhattan since 2018, and under his leadership, his office prosecuted Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, is investigating top Trump confidante Rudy Giuliani and indicted the former New York mayor's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. Tensions between the New York and Washington offices have grown with Berman and Barr butting heads over the handling of some cases, including the indictment of Turkish bank Halkbank. Last fall, Justice Department officials discussed replacing Berman with Ed O'Callaghan, a senior official, but then prosecutors indicted the Giuliani associates, a move that appeared to extend Berman's tenure. Trump and Barr have long taken issue with the office's handling of various cases, but people close to the office believe its string of extremely high-profile investigations -- including those of Cohen, Giuliani and Jeffrey Epstein -- may have deterred Justice officials from pushing out Berman because his exit would have been certain to cause an uproar and charges of political interference. For the last several months, however, largely due to the coronavirus pandemic, the office has had a relatively quiet period, and some believe Barr seized that opportunity to oust Berman. Preet Bharara, a CNN senior legal analyst who was fired by Trump as US attorney for the Southern District shortly after Trump took office in 2017, told CNN's Don Lemon that the late-night announcement was a ""highly irregular thing to do ... when there are all sorts of investigations swirling around."" ""The President, his associates, there may be anger about the way that some of the prior investigations were conducted, with respect to his former lawyer Michael Cohen and others,"" he added. Democrats on Capitol Hill immediately demanded answers. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the ""late Friday night dismissal reeks of potential corruption of the legal process. What is angering President Trump? A previous action by this U.S. Attorney or one that is ongoing?"" House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a New York Democrat, said ""America is right to expect the worst of Bill Barr, who has repeatedly interfered in criminal investigations on Trump's behalf,"" adding that he would invite Berman to testify. Long-running feud with SDNY Trump has frequently clashed with the leadership of the prosecutors' office in New York and bristled at their investigations. The President has been weighing replacing Berman since at least the middle of 2018, two people familiar with the matter told CNN, and Trump made references in private to replacing him since at least the summer of 2018, they said -- only a few months after Berman assumed the role. Trump has grown progressively more upset with the office since it began its investigation into Cohen, and believed its investigation into Giuliani was meant to damage him politically, one person said. In 2018, Trump lashed out after federal agents in New York raided Cohen's office, home and hotel room as part of an investigation by federal prosecutors who were examining a hush-money scheme involving Trump and adult film star Stormy Daniels, calling the searches ""an attack on our country."" Cohen later pleaded guilty to eight counts, including campaign-finance violations, and implicated Trump. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that in 2018, Trump offered to help Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with a Justice Department investigation into a Turkish bank, Halkbank, with ties to Erdogan that was suspected of violating US Iran sanctions. Trump, according to Bolton, told his Turkish counterpart that the Southern District prosecutors ""were not his people, but were Obama people,"" and the problem would be fixed when they were replaced by Trump. At the time, Berman had already been installed in New York office. Berman and the Justice Department brought a case against Halkbank in October 2019. Before Clayton was nominated to the SEC post by Trump, he was a corporate lawyer at Sullivan & Cromwell. If confirmed, Clayton would be the first non-prosecutor to lead SDNY. Barr and Clayton have known each other for years, the Justice official said, and Clayton was planning to leave to go back to NY. He expressed interest in the SDNY job, the Justice official said, and Barr agreed. Barr said Trump has appointed Craig Carpenito, currently the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, to serve as the acting United States attorney for the Southern District of New York until Clayton is confirmed. Carpenito will begin the role on July 3. This story has been updated to include additional reporting, background information and reaction.

69,Why it will be a tough climb to confirm anyone new to Berman's post before the November elections,"Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham's announcement Saturday that he will honor tradition to let home-state senators sign off on a replacement for Geoffrey Berman's US attorney post means that it will be a tough climb to confirm anyone new to the job before the November elections, according to Senate sources.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:50:17 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/f7eARhMblE0/index.html,"Attorney General Bill Barr's effort to push out one of the most powerful prosecutors in the country ran into headwinds Saturday, with Republicans signaling little appetite to fight to confirm a new US attorney amid Democratic accusations that the move was an effort to shield President Donald Trump's associates from federal investigation. Republicans on Capitol Hill were blindsided by the late Friday night effort by Barr to seek the ouster of Geoffrey Berman, whose office at the Southern District of New York was investigating Trump confidante Rudy Giuliani and other sensitive matters. After Barr had announced that Berman would be stepping down, the New York prosecutor said Friday he would not resign until there's a Senate-confirmed replacement. But Republicans on Capitol Hill showed little willingness to confirm a new nominee without Democratic support -- meaning there's a real possibility that the nomination of Jay Clayton to replace him could languish and Berman could stay at the post indefinitely. The fast-moving developments seemed to catch by surprise Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Trump's and Barr's, who said Saturday he had not been told about the effort to fire Berman. And in a significant announcement Saturday, Graham announced that he will honor tradition to let home-state senators sign off on a replacement for Berman's post, meaning that Democrats essentially have veto power over a replacement to a position considered the most powerful US attorney job in the country. Berman, seemingly undeterred by the controversy, showed up to work Saturday morning, telling reporters: ""I'm just here to do my job."" The latest controversy at the Justice Department came after Barr and Berman met Friday in New York, when Barr offered Berman a job at the main Justice Department, something the Manhattan-based prosecutor declined. According to a person familiar with their conversation, Berman was left with the impression that there would be more conversations in the future about his job, and Barr never ""fired"" Berman during their talk. Then late Friday night, the Justice Department sent out a press release that the source said was a complete shock to Berman and implied Berman agreed to leave, prompting the US attorney to issue his extraordinary statement saying he is not resigning. ""I will step down when a presidentially-appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate,"" he said in the statement. Though it isn't clear that any one particular investigation or conflict led to Barr's attempt to push Berman out, federal prosecutors in New York, working under Berman, have continued to pursue cases that pose significant threats to Trump and his allies. In the past month, according to two people familiar with the matter, prosecutors and FBI agents have been actively interviewing witnesses as part of their investigation concerning Giuliani and his former associates, Soviet-born businessmen Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. In April, during discussions about delaying the trial date for Parnas and Fruman as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, prosecutors informed the parties in the case that they expected to file additional charges in what's known as a superseding indictment no later than the end of July, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. In their recent witness interviews, prosecutors and agents have focused on several aspects of the probe, including the campaign-finance allegations and charges tied to a marijuana business venture in an indictment against Parnas and Fruman, these people said. They have also questioned witnesses about Fraud Guarantee, a Florida-based company that paid Giuliani $500,000. CNN has previously reported that prosecutors were weighing additional charges connected to Fraud Guarantee, although it isn't clear that those charges would be filed against Giuliani. Given the controversy surrounding the attempt to replace Berman, Senate sources don't believe a nominee will be confirmed to the post before November since Democrats plan to fight any new nominee. US attorney nominees typically follow what is known as the ""blue-slip"" process in the Senate, meaning that once home-state senators sign off on the nominee, then the confirmation proceedings will take place. But given the controversy around the attempted firing of Berman, it is highly unlikely that both Democratic senators from New York will sign off on Clayton's nomination to replace Berman. On Saturday, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, called on Clayton to withdraw his name for consideration and for an inspector general probe into the reasoning behind Barr's attempt to fire Berman. ""Jay Clayton has a similar choice today: He can allow himself to be used in the brazen Trump-Barr scheme to interfere in investigations by the U.S. Attorney for the District of New York, or he can stand up to this corruption, withdraw his name from consideration, and save his own reputation from overnight ruin,"" Schumer said in a statement. Graham on Saturday signaled he would let Schumer and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand sign off on Clayton's nomination before taking it up in his committee, something that is highly unlikely to happen. ""As to processing U.S. Attorney nominations, it has always been the policy of the Judiciary Committee to receive blue slips from the home state senators before proceeding to the nomination,"" Graham said. ""As chairman, I have honored that policy and will continue to do so."" It's unclear whether Barr and President Donald Trump gave Republicans advanced notice about this attempt to remove Berman, who is investigating Trump associates, and whose office named Trump as ""individual 1"" in the Michael Cohen hush-money scandal where Trump sought to silence stories about his alleged extramarital affairs. Graham said nobody had contacted him about the matter ahead of time, and a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment on Saturday. The process for considering a new nomination for the job would take several weeks, if not several months to play out. The nominees have to get FBI background investigations, have to fill out a questionnaire and have to answer written committee questions for the record. US attorney nominations typically are approved with little dissent since home-state senators have already signed off on their nominations. But this nomination almost certainly would not get backing from both parties, meaning Republicans would have to push the Clayton pick forward and defend Trump's decision to fire Berman in the middle of an election year. There appears to be little appetite for that. Indeed, if the GOP attempted to move Clayton's nomination, it undoubtedly would spark a huge partisan fight and eat up floor time when the Senate has a limited number of legislative days before the August recess and before the November elections.

71,"Who is Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney refusing to step down?","Geoffrey Berman, the powerful US attorney for the Southern District of New York who has been thrust into the national spotlight for refusing to leave his post, has a long history at the prosecutors' office in New York and held a position on President Donald Trump's transition team before going on to investigate a number of Trump associates.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:10:36 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/MW1TGLjFFSw/index.html,"Geoffrey Berman, the powerful US attorney for the Southern District of New York who has been thrust into the national spotlight for refusing to leave his post, has a long history at the prosecutors' office in New York and held a position on President Donald Trump's transition team before going on to investigate a number of Trump associates. Berman was an associate counsel in the Office of Independent Counsel during the Iran-Contra investigation, where he prosecuted a former CIA employee for tax fraud, before serving as an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York from 1990 to 1994. During his first run as a US attorney, he handled criminal prosecutions involving tax securities and computer hacking violations, according to the department's website. He went on to practice in the private sector before helming the US Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York. After Attorney General William Barr tried to oust him from that position late Friday, saying Berman was set to leave the office, Berman released a remarkable statement refusing to step down. ""I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate,"" Berman said. ""Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption."" Appointment initially met with concern Berman has been the US attorney for Manhattan since 2018. His initial appointment was met with some public and private concerns among the office's prosecutors and others about his previous associations with Trump. He had held a position on Trump's transition team, and the President had personally interviewed him for the US attorney post, which worried members of the office who prize its reputation for independence, according to people familiar with the matter. Berman had also been a law partner of Rudy Giuliani -- though they never worked on a case together at their former firm, Greenberg Traurig, LLP, according to a person familiar with Berman's time there, and had little involvement with one another. But in the time since Berman took office, according to people familiar with the matter, New York federal prosecutors have come to support and trust him, saying they believe he has upheld the office's independence and pursued politically sensitive cases based solely on their legal merits. During his tenure, the office has prosecuted Trump's former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, a case from which Berman himself was recused; investigated whether the Trump Organization violated campaign-finance laws; is investigating top Trump confidante Giuliani and indicted the former New York mayor's associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman. An unusual position among US attorneys US attorneys are typically nominated by the President and then are required to be confirmed by the Senate, but Berman, who has led the office since January 2018, is neither. Berman was initially appointed on an interim basis by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions for a 120-day term. At the time, some Democrats promised to use procedural efforts to block Berman's nomination, saying his interview with Trump for the job posed a conflict of interest. When the end of that term came without the White House putting forth a nominee, the judges of the federal district court in Manhattan voted to appoint Berman to remain in the job. As a result, under federal law, he can serve until the Senate confirms a Trump nominee. ""As Interim U.S. Attorney for this same district, he will lead an incredible team of attorneys and investigators and help provide New Yorkers with safety, security, and peace of mind,"" Sessions said at the time Berman took his position. ""I am pleased to appoint him to this important role."" Tension with Trump Trump has been weighing replacing Berman since at least the middle of 2018, two people familiar with the matter told CNN. And he has made references in private to replacing Berman since at least the summer of 2018, they said -- only a few months after Berman assumed the role. The President has grown progressively more upset with the office since it began its investigation into Cohen, and believed its investigation into Giuliani -- which was revealed late last year -- was meant to damage him politically, one person said. In addition, Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that in 2018, Trump offered to help Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with a Justice Department investigation into a Turkish bank, Halkbank, with ties to Erdogan that was suspected of violating US Iran sanctions. In a meeting at the G20 in Buenos Aires, Bolton writes ""Trump then told Erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people."" The Justice Department and Berman did, however, bring a case against the Turkish bank in October 2019. Berman asserted his office's independence There has also been tension between Barr and Berman since Barr became attorney general last year. Barr has attempted to a micromanage certain cases by asking more questions than his predecessors, according to people familiar with the relationship. Berman has pushed back, those people said. And when career prosecutors clashed with Justice Department leadership over the handling of politically sensitive cases, Berman asserted his office's independence. ""The Southern District of New York has a long history of integrity and pursuing cases and declining to pursue cases based only on the facts and the law and the equities, without regard to partisan political concerns,"" he said in March. ""My primary commitment is and has been to maintain those core values and that's how our office is operating.""

72,They voted for Trump. Here's what they think now,"In the wake of Donald Trump's surprise election win in 2016, CNN's Van Jones went on a journey of discovery across America to understand why voters sent Trump to Washington.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 22:49:35 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/z1HySiF2U3g/index.html,"In the wake of Donald Trump's surprise election win in 2016, CNN's Van Jones went on a journey of discovery across America to understand why voters sent Trump to Washington. Today, as the country wrestles with the death of George Floyd in police custody, the protest movement that grew from it, and the national conversation about race that is reverberating in every corner of American life, Jones revisited three of those voters who backed Trump in 2016 to see how they are experiencing this moment in history. Ohio Democrat who backed Trump says clearing White House protesters 'was about the last straw for a lot of folks' Scott Seitz is a union Democrat in blue-collar Trumbull County, Ohio. Farmland and factories dominate the landscape of this stretch of the industrial heartland, which had voted Democrat for president in every election since 1976. But a number of plant closings and layoffs here, especially during Obama's second term, helped deliver the county to Trump in 2016. Seitz, who voted for Obama twice, said that Trump's business background and lack of engagement by then Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton lead him to a first -- voting Republican. ""We put Democrats in office and she turned around and forgot completely about us,"" Seitz told Van Jones back in 2016. ""We are what makes this world go 'round. We built the tanks and bombs that won this country's wars and for you to come through here and completely neglect us, we would have rather vote for anybody instead of her."" Today, he's very troubled by Trump's reaction to the protests and walk to St. John's Church. ""I think he handled it like an arrogant businessman that he is, showing lack of compassion for people. What he did out in front of the church and making those folks move and smoke bombs and tear gas or whatever it was. Just so he can get to that vista and have that shot of him holding that Bible up with that prop. ... If he's any form of religious guy like he says, then he wouldn't have done that,"" said Seitz, adding, ""that was about the last straw for a lot of folks."" Still, Seitz says while he has reservations, he plans to vote for Trump. ""I dislike Biden that much and don't feel he's going to lead our country. I only support him about 10%. Trump's only about 25%,"" he said. What could sway him between now and November is Biden's vice presidential pick because he's so concern ed about Biden's age, he believes Biden likely wouldn't finish a first term. Seitz mentioned California Sen. Kamala Harris as a potential pick he would be interested it, but former First Lady Michelle Obama tops his VP list, although she seemingly ended any speculation about political aspirations in her 2018 memoir ""Becoming"" when she wrote, ""I'll say it here directly: I have no intention of running for office, ever."" 2016 Michigan Trump voter: It's not a systemic issue, 'it's a bad cop issue' Leslie Curtis is a lifelong Republican who once voted Democrat. Back in 2008, he supported Barack Obama, but as a black man, Curtis says he was disappointed in what he saw as Obama's lack of focus on black issues. He never before or since has crossed party lines. Today, Curtis defends the way Trump has handled the protest movement and sees value in his photo op at St. John's Church. ""That's a gesture of him saying that, 'we're strong, you know I believe in the Bible, I believe in Christianity and I'm just going stand by it and we're gonna beat this,'"" said Curtis, adding, ""it was meant to be a symbolic show of strength."" In 2016, while Trump only garnered 6% of the black vote in Michigan, support from voters like Curtis helped Trump win the state by less than 11,000 votes. Curtis has since moved to Arizona, which is expected to be a battleground state in November's election. While Curtis supports people's right to protest, he does not see Floyd's death as indicative of a wider issue with police and race. ""I've had the opportunity to witness black and white police officers abusing their powers so I don't say that it's ... a systemic issue overall but I think it's a bad cop issue. Of course what happened to George Floyd was a tragedy, it was sad. As a black man, it's hard to watch things like that and not have some type of emotion about it, which leads you to react when you're more emotional than think logically,"" he said, adding, ""When you say it's systemic, it takes the responsibility away from the individual who committed the crime."" West Virginia Trump voter: President's response to protests has been 'proportionate' Allen Lardieri is a proud veteran and proud coal miner. In 2016, every single county in his state of West Virginia voted for Trump. Just after Trump's inauguration, Lardieri told Van Jones he hoped the President would not only follow through on his promise to bring coal jobs to his state but that his presidency would be a game changer for every political office. ""My whole reasoning for voting for Trump was not because of policies but the presence of Trump,"" said Lardieri. ""His unconventional nature will cause a political shake-up ... you have these career politicians, the same individuals that's populated Capitol Hill for so long, they're so disconnected from their base. Trump being such an outsider will make people start to think and realize hopefully that, 'Oh, wait, we could possibly lose our jobs if we don't become more representative.'"" Today, Lardieri is satisfied with Trump's record and his reaction to the protest movement. ""I think what he's done has been proportionate,"" said Lardieri. ""He's said that he supports protest. What the President and myself and many others do not support is when somebody hijacks a lawful protest and turns it into some of the things that you've been seeing playing out at night."" As a veteran and an American, however, Lardieri condemns the actions of the officers now charged in Floyd's death. ""I took an oath when I joined the military ... and the oath doesn't leave when you have the uniform on or you have it off. It's still with you for life. Any time somebody that's in a trusted position --  law enforcement, military or otherwise -- steps outside and does something completely outside of their oath, it's insane. And in this case not only is it insane, it's lethal."" "

74,Federal judge denies Trump administration's attempt to block release of Bolton's book,A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's attempt to block the upcoming publication of a book by former national security adviser John Bolton.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:36:34 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/D03vVhMV4n0/index.html,"A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's attempt to block the upcoming publication of a book by former national security adviser John Bolton. Judge Royce Lamberth of the DC District Court wrote in a 10-page decision Saturday morning that the Justice Department's arguments weren't enough to stop the book's release. He cited how the book, which is scheduled to be released Tuesday, had already been widely distributed, and could easily be distributed further on the internet, even if the court said it could not be. ""For reasons that hardly need to be stated, the Court will not order a nationwide seizure and destruction of a political memoir,"" Lamberth wrote. The judge's ruling Saturday quickly dispels a long-shot attempt by the Trump administration to stymy the book's release -- an attempt roundly condemned as antithetical to the First Amendment. But Lamberth's decision also keeps alive major risks for Bolton, such as the administration's effort to claw back proceeds from the book, including from any movie and TV rights, and other consequences for disclosing classified information. Lamberth also noted Bolton could still be exposed to criminal liability. The court fight over Bolton's book has turned the former national security adviser's skirmish with President Donald Trump into a symbolic fight over freedom of speech and the press, and allowed Bolton to push for an outside referee over whether the White House's national security decision-making was proper, or done to protect Trump politically in an election year. Lamberth had heard from Trump administration lawyers and Bolton's team at an almost two-hour hearing Friday, three days after the Justice Department first sued. He reviewed the executive branch's classification descriptions in private following the public hearing. In the decision Saturday, Lamberth slammed Bolton for moving the publication forward before he formally got the administration's approval. ""He opted out of the review process before its conclusion. Unilateral fast-tracking carried the benefit of publicity and sales, and the cost of substantial risk exposure. This was Bolton's bet: If he is right and the book does not contain classified information, he keeps the upside mentioned above; but if he is wrong, he stands to lose his profits from the book deal, exposes himself to criminal liability, and imperils national security,"" Lamberth wrote. ""Bolton was wrong."" Lamberth said the Trump administration convinced him on Friday that sensitive national security information was still included in the book. The judge didn't make a decision at the almost two-hour hearing Friday and said he would wait to review more details from the Justice Department before deciding. ""Upon reviewing the classified materials, as well as the declarations filed on the public docket, the Court is persuaded that Defendant Bolton likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations,"" Lamberth wrote. Bolton attorney Charles Cooper welcomed the ruling in a statement Saturday, but added that ""we respectfully take issue, however, with the Court's preliminary conclusion at this early stage of the case that Ambassador Bolton did not comply fully with his contractual prepublication obligation to the Government, and the case will now proceed to development of the full record on that issue."" ""The full story of these events has yet to be told -- but it will be,"" Cooper said in the statement. One reviewer from the National Security Council had worked with Bolton over several sessions to remove all classified information from the book. But once she finished early this spring, other officials deemed details still in the book to be classified, and the White House told Bolton this month it wasn't ready for publication. President Donald Trump called the ruling a ""BIG COURT WIN against Bolton"" in a post on Twitter Saturday. ""Obviously, with the book already given out and leaked to many people and the media, nothing the highly respected Judge could have done about stopping it...BUT, strong & powerful statements & rulings on MONEY & on BREAKING CLASSIFICATION were made,"" Trump said, adding: ""Bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing, with a really big price to pay."" In a separate statement later Saturday, the White House said that ""the Government intends to hold Bolton to the further requirements of his agreements and to ensure that he receives no profits from his shameful decision to place his desire for money and attention ahead of his obligations to protect national security."" In the book, Bolton makes stunning accusations against his former boss, claiming that Trump personally asked his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, to help him win the 2020 US presidential election, and that he expressed support for China's concentration camps, among other embarrassing foreign relations conversations. Several news outlets including CNN obtained copies of the book this week and published articles describing and quoting Bolton's writing. One reporter from CBS even held a copy while questioning the White House press secretary on camera. By the time the Justice Department sued, Bolton's publisher Simon & Schuster had already distributed 200,000 copies of the book in the US and thousands more have been distributed in the UK, Canada, Australia and India, Bolton told the court. The CEO of Simon & Schuster came to Bolton's defense in court this week, writing that the book's portrayal of Trump is ""of utmost public importance."" And a spokesperson for the publishing company noted they were pleased with the ruling Saturday, saying, ""We are grateful that the Court has vindicated the strong First Amendment protections against censorship and prior restraint of publication."" The book is set to be released on June 23, and it is already believed to be a bestseller. This story has been updated with additional developments Saturday. CNN's Zachary Cohen, Kaitlan Collins, Kristen Holmes and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report."

76,Parent of toddler in 'manipulated' Trump video gets Facebook and Twitter to remove it,Facebook and Twitter on Friday removed a video posted by President Donald Trump's account that had twisted a viral video of two toddlers after one of the children's parents lodged a copyright claim. The video had more than 4 million views on Facebook and more than 20 million views on Twitter before it was taken down.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 03:55:30 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/bBiT2gylqdM/index.html,"New York Facebook and Twitter on Friday removed a video posted by President Donald Trump's account that had twisted a viral video of two toddlers after one of the children's parents lodged a copyright claim. The video had more than 4 million views on Facebook (FB) and more than 20 million views on Twitter (TWTR) before it was taken down. The now-removed clip is a crude and misleading edit of a video that went viral last year which shows a Black child and a White child running to hug each other. The version posted to Trump's account made it first appear as if the Black child was running away from the White child. Jukin Media, a company that represents creators of videos including the parent who owns this video, said in a statement provided to CNN Business Friday afternoon, ""Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorized usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense."" Jukin said in its statement that it had submitted a takedown request to Twitter. Jukin did not confirm it had sent the takedown request to Facebook, but Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesperson, said ""We received a copyright complaint from the rights holder of this video under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post."" Twitter also confirmed it removed the video following a copyright claim. The video was put on Trump's Facebook account after he tweeted it Thursday night, the eve of Juneteenth, the oldest known holiday honoring the end of slavery in the United States. Michael Cisneros, the father of one of the boys in the video, said last year he had posted the original video to social media because he thought it was a beautiful, candid moment to share in the midst of racism and hate in the world. ""The reason that it's getting attention [is] because it is with a little black boy and a little white boy...But if it can change someone's mind, you know, or just change their view on things, then it's totally worth it,"" Cisneros said last year. The version of the video tweeted and posted by Trump first showed a part of the viral video in which one of the boys was chasing the other, which had been overlaid with a fake CNN graphic that read, ""Terrified todler [sic] runs from racist baby."" The rest of the video -- in which the two children run to embrace one another -- is then shown. Responding to Trump's use of the video, Cisneros wrote in a Facebook post Thursday night, ""HE WILL NOT TURN THIS LOVING, BEAUTIFUL VIDEO TO FURTHER HIS HATE AGENDA!! !! !! !!"" CNN Business has reached out to Cisneros for comment. The clip Trump promoted suggested that CNN would have spun the viral video to make it appear negative. In fact, CNN covered the full version of the viral video in 2019. The toddlers and their fathers also appeared on the ""The Van Jones Show"" on CNN. Twitter labeled the video Trump tweeted as ""manipulated media"" shortly after he tweeted it  Thursday night. ""This Tweet has been labeled per our synthetic and manipulated media policy to give people more context,"" a Twitter spokesperson said. Facebook also has a manipulated media policy. The company declined to comment on whether the video violated that policy. Facebook took no action until a copyright claim was filed. A spokesperson for CNN responded to Trump's tweet Thursday night, ""CNN did cover this story - but exactly as it happened. Just as CNN has reported your positions on race (and your poll numbers). We'll continue working with facts and invite you to do the same, rather than tweeting fake videos that exploit innocent children. Be better."" Asked about the video Friday, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said she thought it was funny. ""I think the President was making a satirical point that was quite funny if you go and actually watch the video,"" McEnany said during a press briefing. Jim Acosta, CNN's chief White House correspondent, pointed out, ""It seems as though he's exploiting children to make some sort of crass political point."" McEnany responded by claiming that Trump was ""making a point about CNN specifically. He was making a point that CNN has regularly taken him out of context."" The video Trump tweeted included a credit to @CarpeDonktum, who regularly publishes memes and parody videos supporting the President. After Trump tweeted the video it quickly went viral on Twitter, racking up millions of views in less than two hours. Twitter twice flagged Trump tweets over the past month. The labels Twitter puts on flagged tweets are relatively unobtrusive, but they have enraged the President and his supporters and even prompted Trump to sign an executive order targeting social media companies. In May, Twitter labeled two Trump tweets that made false claims about mail-in ballots in California. A few days later, Twitter labeled as a glorification of violence a Trump tweet in which he said, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Earlier on Thursday, Facebook removed ads run by the Trump campaign, saying the ads violated its policy against organized hate. The ads, attacking the leftwing group antifa, featured a symbol that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) said was ""practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps."" The Trump campaign defended itself claiming the symbol was used by antifa activists. The ADL said in response that some antifa activists have used the symbol, but it is not particularly common. "

Follow him on Twitter: @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. US Attorney General William Barr triggered yet another firestorm this week when he announced that Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, would resign. The news — which was came late Friday night — immediately created concerns that this was a politically motivated ouster. Berman's office has investigated high-level associates of President Donald Trump, including the President's former attorney Michael Cohen and Trump confidante and personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, and Trump had reportedly considered firing him for some time. Barr's move came two days after former national security adviser John Bolton alleged in his new book that the President offered to interfere in a Southern District investigation of a Turkish bank. Trump told Turkish President Recep Erdogan that the problem (that is, the investigation) would be fixed when the prosecutors were ""replaced by his people,"" Bolton wrote. Though Berman was once seen as a Trump loyalist put into office during the purge of Preet Bharara, the President has now turned against him. Berman, however, won't play along. ""I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning,"" he announced Friday. Berman added, ""I will step down when a presidentially appointed nominee is confirmed by the Senate. Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption."" The news is one more piece of evidence that Trump is the anti-law-and-order President, despite his claims to the contrary. Trump touts law and order when it suits him, but attacks the courts and erodes our judicial system when it comes to his agenda and actions. He loves to tweet former President Richard Nixon's famous catchphrase — law and order — which Nixon used in the 1968 election against Hubert Humphrey to promise an end to the riots and protests that had shaken the nation. But the truth is, the Trump administration has repeatedly taken steps that undermine our nation's confidence that this White House adheres to the notion that nobody is above the law. Barr has been the point man in this strategy. He brings a level of legal sophistication and political savvy that Trump lacks and has repeatedly placed the political interests of the President above the law. When the Mueller investigation wrapped up, the attorney general framed the findings of the report in a way that exonerated the President from wrongdoing. During the impeachment hearings and trial earlier this year, Trump reportedly leaned on Barr to limit the ability of legislators to obtain necessary information. And in Trump's post-impeachment attacks on inspectors general and US attorneys, Barr has proven willing to take the bold and controversial steps necessary to insulate his boss. Under Barr, the Justice Department has supported an aggressive response to the Black Lives Matter protests. Millions of Americans have taken to the streets across the country to demand bold policing reforms that aim to stop the police brutality that led to the death of George Floyd. But Barr has denied that systemic racism is a problem in policing, and the Justice Department has stood firm, years after scrapping Obama-era police reforms. The Justice Department also deployed armed forces against peaceful protesters at Lafayette Park. Rather than embracing the notion, which many conservatives would have once agreed to, that protecting individual human rights from unaccountable police officers is the way to ensure law and order on the streets, the Justice Department under Trump has instead pushed for a breathless acceleration of state policing power. The restraints that have checked previous administrations have deteriorated, and we are now living in a moment when President Trump — with Barr's assistance — appears to believe that there are no law and order guardrails prohibiting what he can do. Given the fact that Senate Republicans continue to back him, the President is not wrong in this assumption. Senate Republicans have played an essential role in allowing Trump to continue eroding our democratic institutions. As long as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is willing to stand firm in backing the administration, the odds of any sort of serious check on these kinds of actions diminish. The wildcard remains the courts. This week, the Supreme Court defied the President by ruling that he could not immediately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, delivering a major blow to his anti-immigration platform. This decision came soon after Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch shocked conservatives by joining Chief Justice John Roberts and four liberals on the bench in a decision protecting gay and transgender persons from workplace discrimination. Though the Supreme Court is now under a conservative majority, it is not an institution where members can be primaried out of their posts, and federal judges have the capacity to be true institutionalists, even in an era when many elected officials refuse to accept that role. Certainly, Chief Justice Roberts is following these events with a close eye. As the President bends law and order to fit his own agenda, the biggest question remains: How much are the federal courts willing to tolerate and at what point will they finally check the President in the dangerous campaign that he has undertaken? Until the courts step in, the nation is in a dangerous place. The stories that have converged in the past few weeks have revealed quite clearly that law and order is under threat. The threat, however, isn't coming from the streets but from the highest office in the land. "

In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday Trump said there were ""a lot of insurance reasons"" for why he couldn't go in. That isn't true. Facts First: ""There were no insurance reasons"" why Trump could not have entered St. John's Church, Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington told CNN on Friday. She said only a small room in the basement of the church, a nursery, had been damaged in a fire the day prior, and ""the main sanctuary was not harmed at all."" Trump has faced criticism not only because police used force to clear peaceful protesters out of the way before the photo-op but because he merely brandished the Bible without opening it, offering a prayer, or going into the building. Asked by the Wall Street Journal in a Wednesday interview why he didn't pray, Trump said it was ""very, very noisy"" outside because of the protesters. He added: ""And I didn't think it was exactly the right time to pray. I'm on the sidewalk. And the church itself, I didn't want to go in because they had a lot of insurance reasons. You know, the church was boarded up."" Budde said there was no conversation between Trump's team and church leaders before Trump showed up at the church, which is located a short walk from the White House. Presidents ""usually call in advance"" when they are going to come, she said. Budde said she had herself been inside the church after the fire, to inspect the damage. She said the church was closed to the public at the time of Trump's arrival, but ""no, there were no insurance reasons why he couldn't go in."" ""Of course, he didn't ask -- he didn't tell us he was coming, so there was no way to prepare,"" she said. ""There was nothing in his posture that indicated he was coming to the church to engage with us. There was no engagement."" Trump continued in the Wall Street Journal interview to baselessly blame the peaceful protesters who were present before the Monday photo-op for the fire that police say had been set at the church the previous night. ""The protesters, who, the day before tried to burn down the church,"" Trump said. ""You know, everyone was saying, 'Oh, they were so wonderful.' They weren't wonderful. They tried to burn down the church. And it was, they told me, the same group. A similar group."" Nobody has been charged for the fire. We don't know what Trump was ""told,"" but there is no evidence that any of the peaceful Monday protesters, much less all of them, were responsible. "
79,Cell phone pings led investigators to the bodies of her children,"Authorities used the pings from the cell phone of the brother of Lori Vallow when determining where to search for the remains of her missing children, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate East Idaho News.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:12:23 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/8fK7rzNNu1M/index.html,"Authorities used the pings from the cell phone of the brother of Lori Vallow when determining where to search for the remains of her missing children, according to a probable cause affidavit obtained by CNN affiliate East Idaho News. Earlier this month, law enforcement officials found the remains of Tylee Ryan, 17, and JJ Vallow, 7, on the rural property of Chad Daybell in Fremont County. Daybell was married to Lori Vallow for less than a year. He and Vallow are both in the custody of Idaho officials as their cases move through the courts. Both have pleaded not guilty to charges related to the disappearances. Daybell was charged with concealing evidence and Vallow is accused of desertion and nonsupport of children. Authorities have not said how the children died. According to the affidavit, Vallow's brother, Alex Cox, went to Daybell's property four times in September, and two of those visits came the days after each of the children were last seen. Cox, who died in December, went to Yellowstone National Park on September 8 with Vallow and the two children. It was the last time Tylee was seen. Police say that tracking the phone's location puts Cox in Vallow's apartment three times immediately after the trip to Yellowstone, with the final visit beginning at 2:42 a.m. on September 9. At some point the phone was back in Cox's apartment -- in the same complex -- then shows up in Daybell's backyard at 9:21 a.m. The phone registers being there for more than two hours, except for a time it pings in a city five minutes away, the court document says. About 14 minutes after Cox's phone last registers being in the backyard, Daybell texts his then-wife Tammy Daybell to tell her he shot a raccoon that morning and buried it in their pet cemetery. ""Well, I've had an interesting morning,"" he writes. The investigator, recalling that raccoons are usually nocturnal, notes his suspicion in the affidavit, and says the pet cemetery is where Cox's phone had been. In the days before JJ is last seen, a friend and her boyfriend come to stay with Vallow. The friend recounts for authorities that Vallow said JJ was a zombie. Zombies have dark spirits and a person is in limbo until the body dies, the friend says Vallow told her, according to the affidavit. The friend also tells police that Vallow said she and Daybell are in a church that was to lead the ""144,000"" mentioned in the Bible's Book of Revelation. ""They also stated their mission was to rid the world of zombies,"" the document records. Vallow had also called Tylee a zombie last year, the friend says, according to the affidavit. JJ was last seen the night of September 22, and on September 23, Cox's phone once again pings from Daybell's backyard in a location where human remains are later found. On the day of the property search, Daybell was in his SUV watching authorities from his driveway and on property belonging to his daughter, across the road. About the time remains were found, he drove away and police followed and arrested him, the document says. Authorities conducted a welfare check on JJ near the end of September at the request of his relatives, who hadn't heard from him in months. When they arrived, Vallow informed them he was not at the family home because he was staying with a family friend. Police returned the next day to serve a search warrant after discovering that was not true, but Vallow and Daybell were gone. They were later found in Hawaii, and despite requests from police did not cooperate and did not present the children. Shortly before Tylee, JJ and their mother moved from Arizona to Idaho, Vallow's estranged husband, Charles Vallow, was shot and killed during a fight with Cox, CNN affiliate KIFI/KIDK reported. Cox was not charged in the case, and he died in December, the affiliate reported. Tammy Daybell died on October 19, and a few weeks later, Chad Daybell and Vallow were married. Authorities initially believed Tammy Daybell died of natural causes, but Rexburg police later said her death was suspicious and exhumed her body. "
80,20-year-old trader's apparent suicide causes Robinhood to tweak app,"The family of a 20-year-old student says he died by suicide after confusion over an apparent negative balance of $730,000 on his Robinhood account. Now they are now demanding answers from the millennial-focused trading app.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 12:43:42 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/pCY_ApggfQw/index.html,"New York The family of a 20-year-old student says he died by suicide after confusion over an apparent negative balance of $730,000 on his Robinhood account. Now they are demanding answers from the millennial-focused trading app. Alexander Kearns, who was using Robinhood to trade complex options instruments, was found dead on June 12, according to local authorities in Plainfield, Illinois. His death is being treated as a suicide, according to the family and Robinhood. It isn't clear what factors contributed to his death. The tragedy has drawn attention to the potential dangers of the free-trading boom inspired by Robinhood, which has given young, first-time investors easy access to exotic financial instruments typically used by sophisticated investors. The Kearns family believes Alexander was misled by the app's interface suggesting he owed $730,000, when that was not really the case. ""The kid threw himself in front of a train over nothing, because a tech company can't figure out they shouldn't show a negative $730,000 cash balance to a 20-year-old kid,"" Bill Brewster, a relative of Kearns, told CNN Business. ""How much are these guys thinking about the fire they are playing with?"" Robinhood responds with changes Brewster, Kearns' cousin-in-law, vowed to do whatever it takes to draw attention to what he sees as serious lapses in Robinhood's oversight that allowed for this tragedy to happen. ""This company is toxic to me right now,"" he said. On Friday, after Brewster posted a long Twitter thread about Kearns' death, Robinhood announced a series of changes to its options offering and user interface directly in response to the incident. Robinhood also pledged to do more to explain how these sophisticated trading strategies work. ""We are personally devastated by this tragedy,"" Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt, Robinhood's co-founders and co-CEOs, wrote in a blog post Friday afternoon that confirmed Kearns was a customer. Confusion over a negative balance Brewster shared a note on Twitter that he says Kearns left behind before he died, which indicated he was distraught and confused over his Robinhood account. ""How was a 20-year-old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars' worth of leverage?"" Kearns wrote in the note that Brewster posted. ""The puts I bought/sold should have cancelled out, too, but I also have no clue what I was doing now in hindsight."" Although Brewster initially believed Robinhood had improperly granted Kearns vast amounts of leverage to trade with, he no longer believes that was the problem. Twitter users who saw Brewster's stream of tweets alerted him that options traders on Robinhood sometimes see a negative cash balance until the other half of their trades are executed. In other words, Kearns did not actually owe $730,000. But he was apparently led to believe he did. ""My sense is that it was all over nothing. It was a user interface issue,"" said Brewster. Brewster blamed Robinhood for simultaneously pushing its product to young traders while not putting in safeguards to prevent this kind of confusion. ""That they didn't have enough foresight to think this might happen is offensive to me,"" he said. A source familiar with Robinhood's procedures told CNN Business that during options trading it is possible that cash and buying power will display as negative until the other side of the trade is processed. That does not mean, however, that this is a negative balance due or debt. Still, Brewster questioned why Robinhood hasn't done more to explain this issue to its mostly young users. ""Why is there no pop-up window to say this is not an actual obligation?"" Brewster said. ""Why is it necessary to show a bunch of millennials that you know are signing up in droves? Why is this OK?"" Improving the app Robinhood appears to be working to address this issue directly. The company announced plans Friday to roll out improvements to its user interface, including the way buying power is displayed Robinhood said it would also make improvements to its in-app messages and emails that get sent to customers about options transactions as well as changes to the in-app history page to help users ""understand the mechanics"" of options trades. Additionally, Robinhood said it is ""considering"" additional criteria and education for customers that seek authorization to trade sophisticated options to help them understand how they work. The startup also added additional educational resources in its help center and plans to hire an options education specialist. ""These changes will take a bit of time to roll out, but our teams are hard at work,"" the Robinhood co-founders said in the blog post. The Robinhood co-founders said that while they ""recognize that nothing can ease the pain that Alex's family is feeling now,"" the company is making a $250,000 donation to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and urged people in trouble to reach out for help. Brewster has been tweeting about Kearns' death for the past week and is urging Congress to investigate the issue. ""The only thing I know how to do is fight,"" he said. The free-trading boom The incident underscores some of the risks involved with the free-trading boom. Robinhood's zero-commission business model disrupted the brokerage industry, forcing its rivals to eventually capitulate and do the same. The drastic shifts in business models set off a wave of consolidation in the industry, with Morgan Stanley agreeing to buy E*Trade and Charles Schwab taking over TD Ameritrade. Robinhood is growing rapidly, adding more than 3 million users in 2020 as of May 4. About half of those new users were first-time investors, according to the company. As of June 8, Robinhood's desktop and mobile weekly visitors were up 332% from the year before, according to research from SimilarWeb. That's more than twice the rate of growth as Robinhood's next-closest competitor in the wealth management space. Brewster recalled that Kearns loved technology and was super interested in computers, even at a young age. He said Kearns' favorite company was Microsoft. ""Tech didn't kill him. But people's oversight and building of a tech interface put him in an emotional tailspin he could never recover from,"" he said. "
81,Twitter permanently suspends account of Katie Hopkins,Twitter has permanently suspended the account of extreme right-wing British columnist Katie Hopkins for violating its hateful conduct policy.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 22:07:20 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/HmtnG3PgPIQ/index.html,"Twitter has permanently suspended the account of extreme right-wing British columnist Katie Hopkins for violating its hateful conduct policy. A spokesperson for Twitter would not elaborate on the exact tweets or content that had violated their policy, simply saying: ""Keeping Twitter safe is a top priority for us - abuse and hateful conduct have no place on our service and we will continue to take action when our Rules are broken. In this case, the account has been permanently suspended for violations of our Hateful Conduct policy."" Hopkins is well known for her anti-immigrant views and was previously suspended from Twitter for a week in January. She initially found fame in 2007 as a contestant on the UK's ""The Apprentice"" TV show, a game show modeled on the US program of the same name that starred Donald Trump. Hopkins subsequently became a conservative commentator, and her controversial views on immigration and Islam have regularly made headlines across the UK. In 2015, she compared refugees to cockroaches in an article she wrote for British tabloid The Sun, prompting a petition with more than 300,000 signatures calling for her to be fired. The article even drew condemnation from the United Nations Human Rights Chief. In 2017, she was fired from a radio show when she called for a ""final solution"" to Muslims in the UK following a terror attack in Manchester. Last July, Hopkins made global headlines after President Trump came under fire for retweeting one of her tweets (something he also did during the 2016 campaign.) Twitter's policy defines ""hateful conduct"" as anything that promotes violence against or directly attacks or threatens other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, caste, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or serious disease. ""We also do not allow accounts whose primary purpose is inciting harm towards others on the basis of these categories."" Twitter has been taking a stricter approach to posts on its platform recently, even flagging some of President Trump's tweets for either being hateful or supposedly spreading misinformation. The labels Twitter puts on flagged tweets are relatively unobtrusive, but they have enraged the President and his supporters and prompted Trump to sign an executive order targeting social media companies.

84,"For Black Tulsa residents, the city's racial past and present hover over Trump rally","A group of young Black men stands at attention. Clad in black, they are practicing military drills at BS Roberts Park in Tulsa, Oklahoma.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:55:29 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/x_hu30uSEAM/index.html,"A group of young Black men stands at attention. Clad in black, they are practicing military drills at BS Roberts Park in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ""Original salute! Left face! Back at attention!"" They're preparing for a Juneteenth weekend tinged with tension, in a small city that has garnered national attention. Just a stone's throw from where these men are practicing, President Donald Trump will take the stage on Saturday for his first rally since the Covid-19 outbreak. The men are all Tulsa natives following the tenets of the original Black Panther movement, which was created in 1966 as a force to create social reform. In that vein, they are advocating against the oppression of Black people. Although the small group is comprised of fewer than a dozen men and not affiliated with any national movement, they hope to keep the peace by employing de-escalation tactics if the rally descends into chaos. ""This is unity, this is brotherhood. All of us come from these streets out here,"" Akono Bey, one member of the group, told CNN. ""All of us have dealt with the same problems. We all want better for our children out here. And the only way to get better is to do better."" As Tulsa braces for Trump's visit, civic leaders and others here are mindful of the city's troubled history with racial violence while also cautiously hopeful for the potential of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many are concerned about Trump's visit yet also curious if now is the moment that Tulsa will reckon with its complex racial history. Greg Robinson, a native Tulsan running to become the first Black mayor in the city's history, says he's learning a lot from the young men. But he understands some might view them with a degree of fear, given how young Black men are often depicted. The men have read reports of outside agitators, including white supremacists, disrupting protests in Minneapolis after George Floyd's death. They believe this devalues the Black Lives Matter movement, and they say they will be vigilant for potential trouble as President Trump descends on their city. While the movement is not armed, Oklahoma residents have the right to carry arms. However, they say that is only out of a need for self-defense. ""They're so much more peaceful than what society and media would have you believe,"" Robinson said, referring to the group. ""They want an education, they want economic opportunity. They want the space to be able to express themselves and not feel like they have the police hanging over their neck."" Lasting emotional trauma Like many American cities, Tulsa has experienced well-publicized controversies between the local police department and the Black community. Earlier this month, two teenagers were detained by police for jaywalking after walking down the middle of a street that did not have sidewalks. Police body-cam footage and eyewitness cell phone video show some of the interaction between the officers and the teens. In a video shot by a bystander, one of the officers is seen leaning into his police car where he had placed one of the handcuffed teens. After a few seconds, the officer is seen kicking into the car. Moments later, that officer throws the handcuffed teen out of the car and onto the sidewalk. In police dash camera video released by the Tulsa Police Department, an officer can be seen searching the pocket of the teen who had been put in the front seat of the police car. A few minutes later, the officer can be seen kicking his legs as the teen struggles. Although the boys were eventually released, and the Tulsa Police Department announced an investigation, the lasting emotional trauma of incidents like this one often runs deeper than some realize, Robinson says. ""A white boy wakes up and says, 'What do I want to do today?' And a black boy wakes up and says, 'What can I do today?'"" Robinson said. He hopes that as mayor he can clear a path forward in a city with a long history of racial violence, dating back to the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, which destroyed the Black Greenwood District and killed some 300 Black residents. ""When you look and think that we are just on the sunset of the 100-year anniversary of the Tulsa race massacre, and not one descendant of a victim has yet to receive justice,"" Robinson said. ""There are still families that are being victimized by police violence, and no justice is found."" 'Rally cry' for alt-right? Anissia West is an educator and activist who has also lived in Tulsa her whole life. A descendent of Creek Freedmen, former African slaves of Muscogee Creek tribal members, West says it's crucial for Tulsa to reckon with its past as it looks to the future, starting with President Trump's rally this weekend. She says he should have moved the rally to a different weekend. ""Juneteenth is a whole weekend celebration. It might start on Thursday and last through Sunday,"" she said. She says Trump's decision to rally in Tulsa, not far away from the site of such a deadly racial massacre, is more than coincidence. ""I can't help but look at it as anything other than an act of terrorism,"" she said. ""He knows that whether he believes he is racist or not, he knows that members of the KKK and other alt-right organizations are following him and that they will see what he is doing as a rally cry."" Although West is dismayed by the President's visit, she says she has never been prouder of her city and its response to the police killing of George Floyd. ""I've spent years protesting in Tulsa and other places in Oklahoma with really low turnouts,"" West said. ""I was mad at Tulsa because we have a tendency to do the thing we call 'Tulsa nice,' where we're fighting for something, but we're gonna also have a barbecue. This time was different."" West strolls to a popular spot in the Greenwood District, where a large mural commemorates the neighborhood that was once known as Black Wall Street, at one time the beacon of hope for Black life. ""This is sacred space,"" she said. ""We know this is a space where buildings were destroyed. People died here. But the spirit is still here. But we're still here, and we're going to keep building, and we're not going anywhere."" "

The 53-year-old Zanardi, who had both his legs amputated after a motor racing accident almost 20 years ago, lost control of his handbike machine while competing in the 'Obiettivo tricolore' relay race in Tuscany, Italy on Friday. According to multiple reports, he crossed the white line into the path of an oncoming truck, which was unable to avoid him. Following the accident, the Italian was airlifted to the Santa Maria alle Scott hospital in Siena where he underwent three hours of emergency neurological surgery for facial head injuries. READ: The fairytale of Alex Zanardi continues at Rio Olympics A statement released by the hospital said Zanardi is in a ""stable"" condition in intensive care following his operation. ""He is incubated and supported by artificial ventilation while the neurological picture remains serious,"" read the medical bulletin. Zanardi's plight was captured in the headlines of all the major Italian sports papers as news spread of the seriousness of his accident. ""No Alex, no!"" said Corrierre dello Sport, while Italian prime minister Giusseppe Conte wrote on Twitter:  ""Come on Alex # Zanardi, don't give up. All of Italy is fighting with you."" Zanardi raced for Jordan, Minardi and Lotus in F1 before a successful switch to CART racing in the US where he was series champion in 1997 and 1998. He returned to F1 with Williams for one season in 1999 before returning to the CART series. It was in that formula that he suffered his infamous 320kmh crash at Lausitzring in Germany in September 2001, escaping with his life, but losing both his legs. In an incredible show of determination and spirit, Zanardi adapted to his prosthetic legs and returned to compete in the European Touring Car Championship in 2003, driving for BMW. But it was for his exploits on a handbike that the man from Bologna has become best known to a worldwide audience, winning multiple medals at the 2012 and 2016 Paralympics and world championships. He was in training for this year's Tokyo Paralympics, hoping to add to his impressive tally of gold medals, until it was postponed. Zanardi has also competed in grueling Ironman triathlon races, setting a new world best for a Paralympic athlete at a race in Italy last September as well as continuing to race specially-adapted BMWs in various endurance motorsport events. Messages of support have come flooding in across the sporting world, with former F1 world champion and Indy Car legend Mario Andretti writing: ""I am so anxious and frightened about Alex Zanardi that I'm holding my breath. I am his fan. I am his friend. ""Please do what I'm doing and pray, pray for for this wonderful man,"" he tweeted. ""Alex is one of life's truly inspirational people and as we all know, a fighter through and through. Stay strong and Forza Alex,"" his former Williams team posted on Twitter. ""Fight as you know how to do it, Alex. You are a very great man, courage,"" Ferrari star Charles Leclerc tweeted in Italian. "

""We are committed to being a part of the solution on racial equality, and recognize the term is derogatory,"" Elizabell Marquez, head of marketing for parent company Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, told CNN in a statement. The chocolate-covered vanilla ice cream bar joins brands such as Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's in overhauling long-used names and marketing strategies considered racially offensive. The trend comes amid global demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism following the deaths of George Floyd and other African Americans at the hands of police. Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream has been reviewing the business for some time, Marquez said. The name ""Eskimo"" is commonly used in Alaska to refer to Inuit and Yupik people, according to the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska. ""This name is considered derogatory in many other places because it was given by non-Inuit people and was said to mean 'eater of raw meat.'"" Linguists now say the word has another origin, based on a word meaning ""to net snowshoes,"" the language center notes on its website. But people of Canada and Greenland prefer other names. Nestle sold Dreyer's and the rest of its US ice cream brands to Froneri, a joint venture with a private equity firm, in a $4 billion deal in 2019. "

In California, which on Friday broke another record for the number of cases in a single day, Gov. Gavin Newsom mandated that masks be worn inside public spaces and in situations where staying six feet apart from others is not possible. But at least five sheriff's departments in the state say they won't enforce the order, in some cases citing the minor nature of the offense or a lack of resources. The governor of Nebraska also pushed back against attempts to make masks mandatory. Gov. Pete Ricketts said he will withhold federal coronavirus relief funds from counties that require people to wear face masks in government buildings, according to a state guidance document obtained by CNN on Friday. Health experts are encouraging face coverings to mitigate the pandemic's impact. Fifteen states and Washington DC now require the use of face coverings in public. But while the guidance to curb spread -- which also includes social distancing and limiting large gatherings -- has remained consistent, intensifying anti-science sentiments have led people to ignore public health guidelines, Dr. Anthony Fauci said on CBS Radio Friday. The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases called the trend ""disturbing"" and ""disappointing."" Cases continue to climb, especially in Florida, which experts say could become the next coronavirus epicenter. On Saturday, the state reported 4,049 new cases -- the most reported in a single day -- bringing the state's total to 93,797. Seven other states are reporting their highest seven-day averages of new coronavirus cases per day since the crisis began, including Arizona, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Utah. Globally, Thursday saw the most coronavirus cases reported to the World Health Organization in one day since the outbreak began, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a Friday briefing. The latest trends According to data from Johns Hopkins University: • These 24 states are seeing upward trends in newly reported cases from one week to the next: Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Oregon, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, West Virginia and Wyoming. • Seven states are seeing steady numbers of newly reported cases: Alaska, Arkansas, Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, Nebraska and Wisconsin. • These 18 states are seeing a downward trend: Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Virginia. • One state, Vermont, has seen a decrease of at least 50%. Nationwide, more than 2.2 million people have been infected and at least 119,112 people have died of the virus, according to John Hopkins. Uncertainty in the awaited treatments and vaccines Researchers are racing to get treatments and vaccines approved. But one clinical trial has ended. Novartis, one of the makers of hydroxychloroquine, announced Friday it was stopping its clinical trial in the US of the drug in coronavirus patients. The FDA revoked emergency authorization for the drug to be distributed to treat coronavirus patients on Monday, saying that there was ""no reason to believe"" it worked against the virus and that it also increased the risk of side effects that include heart problems. Novartis said the trial did not stop over safety issues but had trouble recruiting patients. Treating the virus, however, might not come down to one drug, Dr. Rick Stevens, associate laboratory director for Computing, Environment and Life Sciences at the Argonne National Laboratory, told the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology on Friday. ""We think the best strategy is probably a multiple ... therapeutic mix, that would go after multiple targets -- maybe a target that would help in blocking viral entry, one that might block replication, and one that might block some host process that is a problem,"" Stevens said. And it may take a while. It took over a decade to develop effective treatments for HIV, he said. The WHO paused trials for hydroxychloroquine immediately when safety problems arose, and Tedros said it will do the same for highly anticipated vaccines. Immunization has been ""the single most effective health intervention, and the single most effective life-saving intervention for children all over the world,"" said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program. But, he said, ""there are no shortcuts in science and safety is a must."" Research shows soaring cardiac arrests during the pandemic The longer the pandemic continues, the more researchers are learning about its ripple effects. Fatal cardiac arrests soared in the streets and homes of New York at the peak of the coronavirus epidemic there in March and April, researchers reported Friday. People needing emergency resuscitation increased three-fold in 2020 and 90% of those people died, the team at Albert Einstein College of Medicine/Montefiore Health System found. While coronavirus likely caused many of these deaths, others were probably a consequence of an overwhelmed medical system, the researchers reported in the journal JAMA Cardiology. ""The tragedy of the Covid-19 pandemic is not just the number of patients infected, but the large increase in out-of-hospital cardiac arrests and deaths,"" said Dr. David Prezant, a professor of medicine at Einstein and the chief medical officer for the Fire Department of New York, and colleagues concluded. CNN's Alexandra Meeks, Jen Christensen, Jenn Selva, Maggie Fox, Jacqueline Howard and Stephanie Becker contributed to this report."
89,The Miami Dolphins have opened a socially distanced drive-in theater at Hard Rock Stadium,The Miami Dolphins are opening up their home field not to an opposing team but to moviegoers to enjoy two new outdoor movie theaters.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 19:00:00 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/VBXQi3XmqVU/index.html,"The Miami Dolphins are opening up their home field not to an opposing team but to moviegoers to enjoy two new outdoor movie theaters. The Dolphins unveiled the theaters Friday at Hard Rock Stadium, one of which is a drive-in theater that allows moviegoers to drive their cars onto the field to watch a film on the stadium's big screen. Visitors can watch from their vehicle or set up in an assigned ""tailgate space"" directly outside their vehicle while maintaining a 6-feet distance from other vehicles and visitors, according to the Hard Rock Stadium website. Masks must be worn in all common areas where social distancing is not possible. Moviegoers can listen to the movie through the stadium's speakers or from inside their cars by tuning to 100.3 on their car's FM radio. Food and drink service is available to be ordered through an online menu and delivered directly to guests' vehicles. A second movie experience has been created outside the stadium in an open-air theater complete with couches and restaurant-style dining, according to the stadium's website. Moviegoers are assigned seats for each movie and the stadium asks that guests not congregate in public areas. Movies playing this month include ""Jurassic Park,"" ""Despicable Me 3,"" ""Men In Black"" and replays of past Super Bowls. Tickets start at $17 per person for the open-air theater and $39 per vehicle for the drive-in theater, the website says. The drive-in theater can handle 175 vehicles while the outdoor theater can accommodate 400 people, according to CNN affiliate WPLG. All proceeds from the two theaters will go towards the Miami Dolphins Foundation Food Relief Program, according to the stadium. "
90,Healthy teenager who took precautions died suddenly of Covid-19,"It started as a normal day. Dawn Guest, 54, got up and headed out to her job as a nurse around 5 a.m. She heard her 16-year-old son, Andre, stirring in his room, but he had always been an earlier riser, even when his school was shut for Covid-19. Later that day she would get a call from her husband, telling her there was something wrong with their son.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 19:33:39 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/Pw5GMbzYSpA/index.html,"Indianapolis (Kaiser Health News)It started as a normal day. Dawn Guest, 54, got up and headed out to her job as a nurse around 5 a.m. She heard her 16-year-old son, Andre, stirring in his room, but he had always been an earlier riser, even when his school was shut for Covid-19. Later that day she would get a call from her husband, telling her there was something wrong with their son. That call would be the beginning of a 12-day journey that would end in tragedy. ""I can't tell you how a perfectly healthy 16-year-old boy can be making his own peanut butter sandwich late Wednesday night, getting his own tea out the fridge and head up to bed like any other teenager in the state or in the country is doing. And then within 24 hours is fighting for his life,"" Dawn said. Andre, an easygoing sophomore at Lawrence North High School, loved YouTube and knew everything about video games; for his birthday in April, he asked for a game that wasn't set to be released until December, and his parents planned on getting it for him when it was released. He also loved photography and annoying his siblings and excelled at basketball and bowling. Born prematurely at 25 weeks, he and twin sister Abby spent months in the hospital before they were brought home and later adopted by Dawn and her husband, Johnny. Though Andre was diagnosed with moderate autism, his parents were fierce advocates and he thrived with a positive attitude and a smile on his face. ""He always just flew through,"" said Dawn. Because Dawn is a nurse in the nursing home at a continuing care community, the family took more than the usual precautions when the coronavirus started to spread around the United States. After each shift, she'd take off her shoes at the door — where Johnny would disinfect them — and she'd head upstairs to shower. The family cleaned surfaces with disinfectant wipes, wore masks when they had to leave the house and practiced social distancing as much as possible. In fact, Andre was the only family member who did not leave the house at all. But the virus has proven to be a wily foe, circulating in some communities before public health officials realized it was there. It found vulnerable people like Andre Guest despite all recommended precautions. After Dawn left for work that morning, Andre — normally self-sufficient — asked his dad for help getting a drink. Odd. At 1:30 p.m., when Johnny went to check on Andre, the teen said he was tired, but, Johnny said, ""his speech was really slurred. He could still understand me and answer me."" A short time later, when Andre fell down in the bathroom, Johnny called his wife. By the time Dawn got home, Andre had lost the ability to grip objects, he had trouble standing, his head and eyes were rolling, he could not hold his body weight up, and he appeared confused. She called an ambulance, which rushed Andre to the nearest emergency room, which transferred the critically ill teen to Riley Hospital for Children. Although Andre had no underlying medical conditions, the first thing doctors discovered was that he had developed Type 1 diabetes — his blood sugar was a dangerous 1,500 milligrams per deciliter, more than 10 times normal. Type 1 diabetes frequently comes to light for the first time in the setting of an infection. Because he had a fever and cough and was breathing hard, he was tested for Covid-19. Negative. But the doctors were having trouble controlling the teen's blood sugar — usually fairly straightforward with an insulin infusion in a first episode of diabetes. At the same time, his temperature kept rising and his breathing deteriorated even with increasing supplements of oxygen. A second Covid test came back positive and he was moved to a Covid unit. Johnny and Andre's two sisters were subsequently swabbed, and they, too, were positive, though they had only mild fevers and fatigue. Dawn, who was at the hospital with Andre, decided not to get tested because, according to Riley's policy, if she tested positive she would not be allowed back into the hospital until she tested negative twice. A few days later, Andre was on a ventilator, and doctors, trying to understand and treat his quickly changing illness, even tried ""proning"" — placing him on his stomach to improve lung capacity. In his 12 days at the hospital, Andre experienced issues with his brain, heart, lungs, kidneys and more. ""Everything that they would fight to try to correct, the coronavirus would find something else to attack,"" said Johnny. Though the staff had gotten the experimental drug remdesivir for Andre, his kidney and liver function were too poor to safely administer it. Many of Andre's symptoms resembled what has since been dubbed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children — a rare but extremely serious Covid-associated immune reaction that was not described until mid-May. Andre was never diagnosed with the syndrome. Still, his mother thought he'd survive. He was getting superb care, and his blood sugar was finally at normal levels — suggesting the worst of the infection had passed. He was young and had always been resilient. On the morning of April 27, that hope quickly evaporated. His blood sugar spiked. His arterial line began to clot, suggesting coagulation problems that have been a hallmark of the disease. He went into cardiac arrest and, despite chest compressions, succumbed. Andre is among the small number of children who have died of Covid-19 and Indiana's first recorded victim under age 18. ""They were wonderful there,"" Dawn said. ""Every nurse and every doctor. I can't complain. We just didn't get the results that we wanted."" Despite stay-at-home restrictions, Andre's death resulted in an outpouring of support from the community. Letters and cards arrived from teachers recollecting their favorite encounters with the teen. More than 70 cars drove by the Guests' house to express their condolences in a memorial organized by Lawrence Township — where Andre attended school. Marion County Northeast Special Olympics retired Andre's team basketball jersey — No. 54 — and sent it to the family's home. With this virus, ""you are taking care of your community, as much as you're taking care of yourself. You have no idea if you're a carrier or if you've touched something that has it on there,"" said Dawn. Kaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

91,What happened on this island when the tourism 'machine' stopped,There's a reason Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis flew to Santorini earlier this month when he wanted to announce the reopening of his country to tourism.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 08:23:05 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nIvvL74c3sg/index.html," — There's a reason Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis flew to Santorini earlier this month when he wanted to announce the reopening of his country to tourism. When the evening sun begins to dip behind the rim of the extinct volcano of which the island forms part, it is one of the most romantic and beautiful photo opportunities on the planet. It's a view that helps make Santorini Greece's most visited island, receiving up to two million tourists annually -- many arriving on the gigantic cruise ships that can normally be seen parked in the middle of the natural bay below. The island will be welcoming international visitors via airplane once again from July 1, but cautions over the coronavirus mean their numbers will be far fewer than before and the cruise ships won't be returning any time soon. And while that means a brutal time ahead for some businesses, others on the island are relishing the prospect of a new era, one in which Santorini's beauty can flourish without being turned into a ""machine that just created money."" Double blow The impact of a Covid lockdown has already been dramatic for a destination that relies on tourism for 90% of its income. In Santorini's case, the lockdown came as a double blow as the island had recently begun to open its hotels and restaurants all year round. During this enforced isolation only Santorini residents were allowed on the island. Guests from the mainland had to return home and no new tourists were allowed in. The drastic shutdown worked, however. Not one case of the potentially deadly disease was diagnosed on Santorini. Although the island is opening up again, everyone is being careful. Personal protection will not just be for the benefit of guests. ""No one on Santorini wants to catch Covid,"" says Joy Kerluke, who runs Dmitri's Taverna at Ammoudi Bay. ""I have to say that with the lockdown we felt safe on Santorini as we had no cases and nobody was coming here. I think we all enjoyed the scenery and the quietness for a while."" Santorini, with its blue-domed churches and thousand-foot cliffs will look exactly the same, but it's going to be unusually empty. ""We expect 15% percent of the visitors compared to previous years,"" says George Filippidis, general manager of the Andronis Suites hotel on Santorini. ""The economic damage will be huge. We will operate at a loss for 2020 but we want to open so that we offer employment to our staff, and support the local community that is wholly dependent on tourism."" Quiet and uncrowded The complete absence of visitors has allowed several major projects to be completed. ""The new terminal at the airport is now operational,"" says Filippidis. ""The new road which connects Oia with the airport and part of Athinios port has also been completed, so getting round the island is going to be much easier."" For a destination that was second only to Venice with its cruise-ship issues, the fact that very few of these enormous vessels -- if any -- will return in 2020 is considered to be good news. With each ship disgorging up to 3,000 people onto minibuses, these floating hotels clogged up Santorini's roads. ""No cruise ship arrivals have been confirmed yet,"" says Filippidis. ""And even if they start at some point it will be very limited."" At Dmitri's Taverna, one of the few quayside restaurants to offer an uninterrupted view of Santorini's famous sunset, Kerluke is having to space out the tables and prepare personal protection equipment. ""We will have fewer tables along the quay, which for us is hard as we have a small taverna already,"" she says. ""And we will wear masks and gloves. There will be antiseptic for our customers too."" Kerluke, who arrived from Canada 25 years ago, says there are consolations. ""Those people who do decide to come to Santorini will have a lovely time,"" she says. ""They will see Santorini, quiet and uncrowded like it used to be."" 'Strange time' Apart from tourism, the other mainstay of Santorini's economy has been its vineyards. The unique, Assyrtiko-based wines of Santorini are exported all over the world, and most of the island's 18 vineyards are open to visitors. By now the 2019 vintage should be in restaurants and supermarkets across the island, but Petros Vamvakousis, manager of Venetsanos Winery, says the lockdown has disrupted distribution. ""Our 2019 vintage remains inside stainless steel tanks and barrels,"" he says. ""It should have been bottled between February and April but the five people who would do this had to remain at home. Now we are trying to catch up. ""Normally we produce 50,000 bottles a year but we rely on exports, and these are close to zero at the moment. Our distributor in America informed us that while restaurants remain closed in the USA, there is no market for Santorini wine in America."" Like many wineries, Venetsanos had until the crisis been able earn income through tastings and tours. Cut dramatically into the cliffs overlooking Athinios Harbour, the winery has a beautiful terrace where wine is served with snacks, but Vamvakousis says that the numbers of people who can be accommodated will be limited to four or six per table from now on. ""We are living in a strange time,"" he says. ""Everything about the island reminds me of winter. Many restaurants, cafés and hotels are closed. It is summer now and it is extremely strange for Santorini to be so quiet and lonely."" Stopping the 'machine' Vamvakousis says he is optimistic that busy days will once again return, but believes the enforced downturn will help prompt a reevaluation of the island's future. ""Santorini is one of the most beautiful places on Earth, but I am sure that lockdown was helpful,"" he says. ""It stopped the machine that just created money and did not care about the environment. Now it is the right time to think what was wrong with Santorini. We have the right to protect, but we don't have the right to destroy."" While money is going to be a big issue in 2020, not everything about the interrupted tourist season is a disaster. Gill Rackham, originally from Britain, who has run Lotza restaurant and the Oia Old Houses apartments with her husband Vasilis for more than 30 years, sees mixed blessings. ""About a month ago our July bookings were looking good, approximately 75% occupancy, but now it's down to 20% and falling,"" says Rackham. ""But my take is that within this catastrophe there will be winners. Santorini has been given a respite to breathe again... no crowds, no traffic jams... no cruise ships."" Rackham has noticed that ""on the beaches of Perivolas and Perrissa there are a few tavernas up and running but most for local Greeks and Athenian visitors! Elsewhere owners are starting to return to open up for 1 July, which is the expected date for international flights."" Some hotels have taken the three-month lockdown time to rethink how they interact with guests. ""We will be offering our services digitally,"" says George Filippidis at Andronis. ""You'll be able to check in online, order cocktails, book a cruise in the azure Aegean waters, and check out when your trip comes to an end, simply by using your mobile device."" Honeymoon advantage Indeed the privacy model that made Santorini so successful as a honeymoon destination could well work to its advantage. ""Rather than huge hotels with large public spaces, most of Santorini's suites have private entrances and sunlit balconies with a dedicated pool or Jacuzzi that is cleansed and chlorinated daily,"" says Filippidis. ""Breakfast is served in your room, not in a dining hall. This is ideal for guests who want to feel safe. Unlike in big resorts we're not having to put up perspex screens between sun-loungers."" Greece is no stranger to financial crises, but in the 1950s and '60s, and as recently as 2008, it has always been able to look to mass tourism as a means of reviving the economy. The irony of the current situation is that tourism, once the solution, is now the problem. In his Santorini speech, Prime Minister Mitsotakis said he wants Greece to be safe but he also knows with 20% of Greek nationals working in tourism and the industry contributing up to 30% of the economy, he needs islands like Santorini to have a long and profitable summer and even a prosperous fall."
92,Which international destinations are reopening?,"Although most governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel, a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 17:09:24 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RLLRPDkc6QU/index.html," — Although most governments are still advising against ""nonessential"" international travel, a host of popular destinations are beginning to ease their Covid-19 lockdown measures and border restrictions and are moving toward welcoming tourists back. Back in May, the European Union unveiled an action plan to reopen its internal borders in time for summer, while countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have formed ""travel bubbles,"" lifting restrictions for each other's citizens. Some Caribbean islands are already beginning to open their doors to foreign visitors again, while destinations such as Mexico and Thailand are planning to reopen region by region in the coming weeks. If you're one of many travelers eagerly awaiting news on where you can travel to this year, here's a guide to the top destinations making plans to reopen, as well as some of those that are keeping their borders firmly closed for now. Aruba The Caribbean island of Aruba is planning to open its doors to travelers once again at some point between June 15 and July 1. However, the visitor's bureau for the Caribbean island, which has reported just over 100 confirmed coronavirus cases, says this ""tentative"" date may change if Aruba opts to ""consider additional precautionary measures as needed."" Although there's no mention of any Covid-19 testing requirements for arrivals, tourists will be required to undergo temperature checks on arrival. While nonessential businesses including shopping malls, cinemas, beauty salons and outdoor restaurants were allowed to reopen on May 25, the island country's 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in place. This means such establishments are required to close by 10 p.m. every day. In addition, the department of Public Health has introduced the ""Aruba Health & Happiness Code,"" a mandatory cleaning and hygiene certification program for all businesses related to tourism in the country. Bali Bali has also been successful in containing its coronavirus outbreak, with less than 350 confirmed cases and, at the time of writing, a total of four deaths. The Indonesian island now hopes to welcome tourists back by October, provided its infection rates stay low. According to a statement from Ni Wayan Giri Adnyani, secretary of the ministry, Yogyakarta, situated on the island of Java, is likely to reopen first, along with the Riau islands province. Bali's economy is hugely dependent on tourism and visitor numbers have been rising in recent years, with around 6.3 million people visiting in 2019. ""The coronavirus has collapsed the Balinese economy ... it's been a steep drop since [mid-March] when social-distancing measures were put in place,"" Mangku Nyoman Kandia, a Bali tour guide, told ABC News in April. ""No tourist, no money."" All foreign nationals, except for diplomats, permanent residents and humanitarian workers, are currently banned from Indonesia, and anyone entering the island must undergo a swab test and provide a letter stating they are free of Covid-19. It's unclear what the entry requirements will be if restrictions are lifted later this year, or whether Bali will accept travelers from regions badly affected by the pandemic. However, tourism officials have been calling for a ""travel bubble"" to be implemented between Bali and Australia. Cyprus Cyprus is so keen to get its tourism industry back on track, officials are offering to cover the costs of any travelers who test positive for Covid-19 while on vacation in the Mediterranean island nation. According to a letter shared with CNN, the Cypriot government will pay for lodging, as well as food, drink and medication for tourists who are taken ill with coronavirus during their visit. The detailed plan was set out in a five-page letter issued to governments, airlines and tour operators on May 26. Officials have also earmarked a 100-bed hospital for foreign travelers who test positive, while a 500-room ""quarantine hotel"" will be available to patients' family and ""close contacts."" ""The traveler will only need to bear the cost of their airport transfer and repatriation flight, in collaboration with their agent and/or airline,"" states the letter. The country's hotels began to reopen on June 1, while international air travel restarted on June 9. Once the destination reopens, visitors from only chosen countries will be allowed to enter. Officials have issued a list of countries to be granted access to Cyprus in two separate stages. Incoming flights from Greece, Malta, Bulgaria, Norway, Austria, Finland, Slovenia, Hungary, Israel, Denmark, Germany, Slovakia and Lithuania will be authorized first. From June 20, Cyprus will also permit incoming flights from Switzerland, Poland, Romania, Croatia, Estonia and the Czech Republic. The UK and the US, both listed among the nations with the highest number of confirmed Covid-19 deaths, are noticeably absent. However, the list is to be expanded to include furthe23r countries in the coming months. Travelers heading to Cyprus will need to provide a valid certificate proving they've tested negative for Covid-19, while they'll be subject to temperature checks on arrival as well as testing at random during the course of their trip. The destination has already put measures in place to protect travelers and residents, such as ensuring hotel staff wear masks and gloves, regularly disinfecting sunbeds and keeping tables at restaurants, bars, cafés,and pubs at least two meters (6.5 feet) apart. Tourism accounts for at least 15% of Cyprus's economy. Egypt Tourism brings in around $1 billion in revenue for Egypt each month, so the impact of the travel restrictions caused by the pandemic has been significant. The government suspended passenger flights back in March, while all hotels, restaurants and cafes were closed and a night curfew imposed. These measures are currently being relaxed, with hotels that meet certain requirements, such as having a clinic with a resident doctor on site, being granted permission to reopen for domestic visitors at a reduced capacity. But a curfew remains in place between 8p.m. and 5 a.m, and the government has made wearing masks mandatory in public places and public transport. Although international flights are yet to begin operating again -- bar a select few routes -- the cabinet has indicated scheduled international flights will be allowed to enter from July 1, while foreign tourists will be permitted at the resorts least affected by Covid-19. ""We have to prepare,"" cabinet spokesman Nader Saad said during a televised interview last month. ""A number of global carriers have expressed willingness to resume flights to Egypt in July, and as a result we are considering a gradual resumption of international flights beginning towards the end of this month and in the first half of July."" France France was the most visited country in the world before the coronavirus pandemic. Now, like the rest of the EU, restrictions are currently in place on all nonessential travel from outside the Schengen Zone (a grouping of 26 countries which normally have open borders). Travelers who do enter the country, with the exception of EU citizens or arrivals from the UK, will be subject to a compulsory 14-day quarantine until at least July 24. Although the government is slowly lifting lockdown measures, with car journeys of up to 100 kilometers now allowed and beaches beginning to reopen, officials have made it clear the country is in no hurry to ease border restrictions for international travelers. ""Since the start of the crisis, the closure of the borders is the rule, and the authorization to cross a border is the exception. ""We have to keep this protection in place, this will not change soon,"" French Interior Minister Christophe Castane said during a televised news conference earlier this month. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe recently announced a $19.4 billion stimulus package to boost its ailing tourism sector. ""What is good for tourism is often good for France, what strikes tourism strikes France,"" he said during a news conference. The country's hotels, bars, restaurants and cafés were granted permission to reopen on June 2. Meanwhile Paris was downgraded from a ""red zone"" to a ""green zone"" in mid-June It was announced on May 29 that the country's most visited museum, the Louvre, will reopen July 6. ""Tourism is facing what is probably its worst challenge in modern history,"" added Philippe. ""Because this is one of the crown jewels of the French economy, rescuing it is a national priority."" He went on to state that residents can take holidays within France during July and August. The country's hotels will be reliant on domestic tourism once they do reopen, as all signs suggest international travelers will not be able to enter for the foreseeable future. ""When the lockdown measures soften, French tourists are likely to want to stay close to home in the short term,"" a spokesperson for French hotel chain Accor told CNN Travel earlier this month. ""It will be the moment for them to rediscover their own country and we will be there to welcome them."" Georgia Georgia was experiencing a tourism boom before the coronavirus pandemic, with five million travelers visiting in 2019, a 7% increase on the previous year. But the country was forced to close its winter resorts and place a ban on all foreign visitors back in March because of the crisis. Eager to revive its tourism sector, the country's government says it plans to reopen to international travelers on July 1. Officials have brought in a three-stage ""anti-crisis"" plan, which includes a marketing campaign designed to promote Georgia as a ""safe destination."" The next stage will allow for domestic travel in special ""safe"" tourism zones, while the final stage involves reopening borders and resuming some flights. ""We are transitioning to the third stage [of Covid-19 response], which means post-crisis management of the economy and devising plans [on] how to kickstart different sectors,"" Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia said at a recent council meeting focused on fighting Covid-19. ""[The] tourism sector will be first to which emergency relief measures will apply."" Germany Although nonessential travel to Germany is prohibited at present, the land of poets and thinkers lifted restrictions for EU countries on June 15. Officials are also considering allowing entry to visitors from Turkey, the UK, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, although a final decision is yet to be made. The proposal was listed in a paper called ""Criteria for the Enabling of intra-European Tourism,"" which suggested the current travel warnings would be replaced by individual travel advice relating to each country. ""The revitalization of tourism is important both for travelers and the German travel industry, as well as for the economic stability of the respective target countries,"" it reads. The Austria/Germany land border is also reopening -- travel between Austria and Germany is possible as of June 15 -- and restrictions around the country are being relaxed. Bars, restaurants and museums have reopened, while some hotels have begun to resume business. Chancellor Angela Merkel has opted to extend social distancing rules until June 29. Greece Tourism accounts for almost 20% of Greece's gross domestic product, as well as one in five jobs, so it's perhaps no surprise the Mediterranean nation is angling to reopen to tourists as soon as it possibly can. The European country, which managed to keep its coronavirus case numbers low by implementing a strict lockdown early on, has already begun to allow some travelers back in. ""The tourism period begins on June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced on May 20. ""Let us make this summer the epilogue of the [Covid-19] crisis,"" he added. Mitsotakis went on to state that direct international flights to Greek destinations will slowly resume from July 1, and tourists from 29 designated countries will no longer be expected to take a Covid-19 test or go into quarantine on arrival. However, Tourism Minister Haris Theoharis has indicated health officials will conduct spot tests when necessary. ""The tourism experience this summer may be slightly different from what you've had in previous years,"" Mitsotakis told CNN earlier this month. ""Maybe no bars may be open, or no tight crowds, but you can still get a fantastic experience in Greece -- provided that the global epidemic is on a downward path."" The 29 countries are Albania, Australia, Austria, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Estonia, Japan, Israel, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Latvia, Lebanon, New Zealand, Lithuania, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, South Korea, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Finland. Greece resumed regular ferry services to its islands on May 25, while travel restrictions within the country were lifted on May 18, ""allowing movement from one prefecture to another,"" apart from the islands. Bars and restaurants have also been allowed to take up business again, while city hotels were scheduled to reopen on June 1, followed by seasonal hotels in July. All international passengers had previously been required to take a Covid-19 test upon arrival or go into quarantine for 14 days. Mitsotakis had suggested tourists would be required to undergo testing before their visit as a further precaution in the future, but it seems this is only the case for travelers from countries that aren't on the list, which is based on a document from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency of airports worldwide ""located in affected areas with high risk of transmission of the Covid-19 infection."" Iceland Iceland reopened it borders to tourists on June 15 after recording just under 2,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases. The move came weeks after the Nordic country banned all foreign nationals, except for nationals of the EU and associated European countries. Up until recently, everyone arriving from outside the country was required to go into quarantine for 14 days. However, travelers now have the option to either submit to a Covid-19 test on arrival, provide proof of a recently taken test with a negative result, or agree to a two-week quarantine. Although the tests are currently free, a $112 charge will be implemented from July 1. Visitors will also be encouraged to download the app Rakning C-19, designed to help trace the origin of transmissions and available in seven languages -- Icelandic, English, Polish, German, French, Spanish and Italian. ""When travelers return to Iceland we want to have all mechanisms in place to safeguard them and the progress made in controlling the pandemic,"" Thordis Kolbrun Reykfjord Gylfadottir, Minister of Tourism, Industry and Innovation said in an official statement last month. ""Iceland's strategy of large-scale testing, tracing and isolating have proven effective so far. "" We want to build on that experience of creating a safe place for those who want a change of scenery after what has been a tough spring for all of us."" Italy Italy has been one of the destinations worst hit by the pandemic, but the hugely popular European country is keen to get its tourism industry up and running now that infection rates have slowed down. Travelers from the EU, along with the UK and the microstates and principalities of Andorra, Monaco, San Marino and the Vatican, were  allowed to enter without having to go into quarantine starting June 3, in a move the government has described as a ""calculated risk."" ""We're facing a calculated risk in the knowledge that the contagion curve may rise again,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a televised address to the nation earlier this month. ""We have to accept it; otherwise, we will never be able to start up again."" Visitors were previously required to undergo a two-week quarantine before being allowed entry. All museums, including Rome's Vatican Museums, have been slowly reopening throughout May with strict social-distancing rules. Bars and restaurants were permitted to reopen with reduced numbers of diners as well as plastic shields to divide customers, on May 18. St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican also opened its doors again on May 18 after being closed for over two months, the Leaning Tower of Pisa has also reopened, while the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express is scheduled to return to railways on July 8. Jamaica Jamaica reopened to international tourists on June 15, nearly three months after closing its borders. Up until the end of June, travelers heading to the Caribbean island will be required to complete a travel authorization form within 72 hours of departure and be willing to undergo a test for Covid-19 on arrival. A ""resilient corridor"" has also been introduced, limiting the movement of visitors to a section of Jamaica's northern coast between Negril and Port Antonio. Hotels and businesses within this area are allowed to reopen provided they have received a ""Covid-19 Readiness Certificate"". Visitors will also be required to adhere to local protocols, such as wearing face masks or coverings in public and social distancing. ""Tourism is the lifeblood of our local economy, and with the help of international experts and a dedicated task force, we have developed protocols that allow us to safely reopen our borders,"" Jamaica's Director of Tourism Donovan White said in a statement. ""We are confident that as we restart our economy, Jamaicans will work together to ensure a safe, secure and seamless experience for our tourism workers, their families, and visitors, while preserving the authentic experiences travelers seek when they visit our shores."" Jamaica welcomes over 4.3 million visitors each year, with tourism accounting for 34% of its GDP. The Maldives The Maldives closed its national borders and canceled all flights shortly after recording its first two coronavirus cases in March. However, around 30 resorts here have stayed open, with tourists opting to self-isolate in the famous honeymoon destination rather than return home. The island nation, which is made up of over 1,000 islands, has recorded around 1,457 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19 so far. While it was previously thought the destination would reopen at the end of the year, officials have brought this forward to July. A spokesperson for the tourism board has confirmed the Maldives will be open to tourists of all nationalities from July. While a previous draft proposal indicated travelers would need to present a medical certificate confirming proof of a negative Covid-19 test, the new plans will see visitors allowed to enter the country without prior testing or a mandatory quarantine period. There are also no new visa requirements or additional fees. ""We are planning to reopen our borders for visitors in July, 2020,"" reads an official statement issued by the Ministry of Tourism on May 30. ""We also want to assure our guests that they will not be charged any additional fees to enter the Maldives."" The government is also considering issuing a ""Safe Tourism License"" for tourist facilities that comply with government legislation and certain safety requirements, such as having a certified medic readily available and holding an ""adequate stock"" of PPE equipment. But the destination's tourism board has confirmed that visitors will not have to commit to spending a minimum of 14 days in the country, as was previously suggested, nor will they need to have a confirmed booking with a tourist facility with a ""Safe Tourism License."" The Maldives received more than 1.7 million visitors in 2019 and the destination had expected numbers to rise to two million in 2020. Malta Shortly after Malta registered its first Covid-19 case in March, a mandatory 14-day self-quarantine was put in place for all tourists entering the small Mediterranean country. Outbound flights to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Switzerland were then suspended, before all flight departures and arrivals were banned on March 20. Prime Minister Robert Abela recently confirmed Malta will be re-opening its borders to visitors from at least 17 countries on July 1. Travelers from Germany, Austria, Cyprus, Switzerland, Iceland, Slovakia, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Finland, Ireland, Lithuania, Israel, Latvia, Estonia, Luxembourg, and the Czech Republic will all be permitted to enter without going into self-isolation for two weeks. The destinations chosen are those apparently deemed ""safe"" by the Malta Tourism Authority with regards to Covid-19 transmission. However, restrictions on all other flight destinations will be lifted from July 15, according to officials. Mexico Mexico is aiming to welcome visitors back within weeks. While the nation remains in lockdown, with hotels and restaurants yet to recommence business, officials are planning to reopen the country bit by bit in order to get things back on track. ""The plan for the country is to open in stages and by regions,"" WTTC CEO Gloria Guevara told CNN Travel recently. ""The target is domestic travelers first, followed by travelers from the US and Canada and then the rest of the world. However, the border between the US and Mexico border will remain closed to ""nonessential"" travel until July 21, according to a statement from the US Department of Homeland Security on June 16. The restrictions were first announced in mid-March. While most international flights in and out of Mexico's key airports are currently suspended or significantly reduced, Delta Air Lines will be increasing and/or resuming various services from the US to Cancun, Mexico City Los Cabos and Puerta Vallarta in the coming weeks. Quintana Roo, a state on the Caribbean side of Mexico that's home to the likes of Cancun, Playa del Carmen and Tulum, hopes to reopen in mid-June, according to Marisol Vanegas, the state's tourism secretary. ""We want to revive tourism and expect to start opening sights and hotels sometime between June 10 and 15 but don't know which ones yet,"" she says. ""It depends on what the federal government allows us to do."" Meanwhile, Los Cabos will kick off a five-phase plan to revive tourism in June. Rodrigo Esponda, managing director of the Los Cabos Tourism Board, says he hopes to be able to accept both international and domestic travelers by August and September. However, beach destination Riviera Nayarit, situated north of Puerta Vallarta, currently has no immediate plans to bring back tourists, according to Richard Zarkin, the public relations manager for the Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau. Portugal Portugal is still in the process of relaxing lockdown restrictions, allowing restaurants, museums and coffee shops to reopen at reduced capacity from mid-May. But the European country is keen to revive its struggling tourism industry, with Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva recently declaring ""tourists are welcome."" While incoming flights from outside the EU are still suspended, some routes in and out of Portuguese-speaking nations such as Brazil are still operating. The land border between Portugal and Spain, which has been closed to tourists since March, is unlikely to reopen until EU travel restrictions are lifted. ""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said earlier this month. Although the prospect of reopening to international tourists appears to be a little while off, officials are putting measures in place to ensure foreign travelers will feel confident to return once they're able to. Rita Marques, the country's Secretary of State for Tourism, has launched a ""don't cancel, postpone"" scheme, allowing tourists to reschedule any pre-arranged holidays to Portugal until the close of 2021. This is valid for all bookings made through accredited travel agencies, along with hotels or Airbnbs, for trips scheduled between March 13 and September 30, 2020. In addition, national tourism authority Turismo de Portugal has created a free hygiene-certification stamp to distinguish ""Clean & Safe"" tourism enterprises to increase visitors' confidence. Businesses will have to comply with hygiene and cleaning requirements for the prevention and control of Covid-19 to receive the stamp, which is valid for one year. According to Santos Silva, Portugal's airports will soon be introducing health checks for arrivals, but visitors will not be subject to a mandatory quarantine Spain Spain's lockdown was one of the toughest in Europe, but restrictions are gently being lifted. Beaches set to reopen in June while hotels in some parts of the country have already been permitted to resume business. From July 1, the European destination, which welcomed a record 84 million visitors in 2019, will grant EU travelers permission to enter without having to quarantine for two weeks. ""Come July, we will allow the arrival of foreign tourists to Spain under safe conditions,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said at a recent news conference. ""We will guarantee that tourists are not at risk, and that they don't represent a risk (to Spain)."" While there's been little mention of opening borders to travelers beyond the EU, it's thought Spain is hoping to follow the lead of destinations such as Lithuania and  the Czech Republic by establishing safe corridors, or a ""travel bubble,"" with nearby destinations that have managed to keep the outbreak under control. ""We have to guarantee, when international tourism opens, that the person who comes to Spain is a safe person,"" Spanish Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto recently told local newspaper El Pais. ""The issue of borders will be accompanied by the evolution of the health crisis."" At present, it's mandatory for anyone 6 and older to wear face masks while in public, both indoors and outdoors, ""where it is not possible to maintain [an interpersonal] distance."" St. Lucia St. Lucia is one of several Caribbean islands trying for a tourism comeback. The tropical destination, which closed its orders to foreign travelers on March 23, began its phased reopening on June 4, when it lifted it borders to visitors from the United States. Those traveling to the country must present ""certified proof"" of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 48 hours of boarding their flight. Visitors will also be subject to screening and temperature checks by port health authorities and must wear face masks and maintain social distancing during their visit. Officials are also bringing in new safety measures for taxis to separate drivers and passengers. ""Our new protocols have been carefully crafted and will build confidence among travelers and our citizens,"" Minister of Tourism Dominic Fedee said in a statement. ""The government of Saint Lucia remains resolved to protect both lives and livelihoods as it jump starts its economy."" Local businesses have also been allowed to reopen, provided they have appropriate cleaning measures and social distancing measures in place. Details of the second phase of the island's reopening, which is to begin on August 1, will be announced in the coming weeks. Thailand Thailand has long been among the top destinations for travelers, receiving close to 40 million foreign tourists last year. However, visitors have been banned from entering the Southeast Asian country since March because of the pandemic. While the number of cases here has been relatively low in comparison to other destinations -- Thailand has reported more than 3,000 confirmed cases and over 50 deaths -- officials aren't taking any chances when it comes to reopening the country. ""It is still dependent on the outbreak situation, but I think the earliest we may see the return of tourists could be the fourth quarter of this year,"" Yuthasak Supasorn, governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) told CNN Travel. The governor went on to stress there will be limitations on who can visit the country and what regions they can go to once restrictions are relaxed. ""We are not going to open all at once,"" he added. ""We are still on high alert, we just can't let our guards down yet. ""We have to look at the country of origin [of the travelers] to see if their situation has truly improved."" This effectively means Thailand is unlikely to open its borders to travelers from destinations that don't appear to have the coronavirus situation under control. Those that are given permission to enter may be offered ""long-stay packages"" in isolated areas ""where health monitoring can be easily controlled,"" such as the remote islands of Koh Pha Ngan and Koh Samui. However, Thailand's borders are firmly shut for the time being. The ban on incoming international commercial flights -- excluding repatriation flights -- was recently extended until June 30 and Phuket International Airport remains closed. As a result, the TAT estimates that visitor numbers will drop to 14 to 16 million this year. Like many other global destinations, Thailand is currently focusing on domestic tourism. In fact, some resorts and hotels have already been given the go ahead to reopen -- Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometers (124 miles) south of Bangkok, being one of them. Shopping malls, museums, markets and some tourist attractions have also been reopening their doors, with Bangkok's Grand Palace resuming business on June 4. Turkey Turkey made over $34.5 billion from tourism in 2019, and the transcontinental country is eager to get back in business. According to Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy, the destination plans to restart domestic tourism by the close of May and hopes to receive international visitors from mid-June. During an interview with Turkish news channel NTV, Ersoy indicated that Turkey may reopen to Asian countries such as China and South Korea first. The country has set out new guidelines for its hotels and resort facilities, such as temperature checks at entrances and at least 12 hours of room ventilation after checkout. Guests will be required to wear face masks and maintain social distancing. ""The more transparent and detailed information we give, the more we will earn the confidence of tourists,"" Tourism Minister Mehmet Ersoy told Reuters earlier this month while revealing plans to open around half of Turkey's hotels this year. Meanwhile, restrictions on intercity travel have been lifted, while restaurants, cafes, parks and sports facilities are permitted to reopen from June 1, along with beaches and museums. Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, one of the world's largest markets, reopened for the first time in two months on June 1. United Arab Emirates When the UAE, which is made up of seven emirates, closed its borders in March, the stringent restrictions included withdrawing tourist visas and banning all outgoing flights. A nationwide night time curfew, officially called ""the national sanitization program,"" was also put in place, while the emirate of Dubai issued a 24-hour lockdown, which meant its residents had to apply for a police permit to leave their homes. Now the Emirati authorities are gradually scaling down these restrictions. In the past few weeks, hotels have started to reopen for domestic tourists at a reduced capacity and under strict guidelines. In Dubai, guests are required to wear masks at all times and can only check in to rooms 24 hours after the previous guest has checked out. Meanwhile, in Abu Dhabi, masks are also compulsory for guests and all returning employees be required to undergo Covid-19 screenings. A number of shopping malls and restaurants in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah have been allowed to open their doors again, provided they follow strict sanitation and social-distancing rules, while Dubai's public  parks and hotel beaches are permitted to open for groups of up to five people. In April, Dubai opened its first drive-through coronavirus testing center, located at the Al Nasr Club, which supplies tests for no charge. Although flights remain suspended, the Emirates' main airports are being reopened for connecting flights, while Emirates-based airlines Etihad, Emirates, flydubai and Air Arabia say they will recommence flight schedules in the coming weeks. ""We welcome the UAE authorities' decision to re-open UAE airports for all connecting travelers. Emirates and Flydubai will shortly announce the resumption of passenger flights to more cities with connections to, and through, Dubai,"" Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President of Dubai Civil Aviation Authority, tweeted on June 3. ""The decision includes Abu Dhabi International Airport, Dubai International Airport, and Sharjah International Port, and covers Etihad Airways, Emirates, flydubai, and Air Arabia."" Despite this, officials are yet to offer a strong indication of when international tourists will be allowed to return to the Emirates. During a recent interview with Bloomberg TV, Helal Al Marri, the Director General of Dubai's Department of Tourism and Commerce Marketing, suggested that foreign travelers could return to the destination in July or September, depending on how the situation develops. ""The thing about this current scenario is it's a global question: many airports internationally remain closed and it's really about the bilateral discussions that are under way to have a coordinated approach to the reopening,"" he said. ""We're quite concerned about the timeline, that's the main risk: is it going to be July when things open up? Is it going to be September? ""We just need to make sure we're ready if things come earlier than expected."" United Kingdom While other destinations are relaxing travel restrictions and bringing in measures to lure travelers back, the UK is choosing to enact stricter regulations. Despite previously opting against a mandatory quarantine for travelers, visitors to the UK are now required to self-isolate for a 14-day period. Under the new rules, which came into effect on June 8, all arrivals will have to provide an address, at which they must remain for two weeks. Those who break the rules will be subject to fines of up to $1,218. The decision, which is to be reviewed every three weeks, has quashed any hopes of rescuing international tourism here in the coming weeks. It's thought the move may discourage airlines from restarting flight operations swiftly, while officials have warned there's little chance of UK residents being able to go abroad this summer. ""I'm saying, right now you can't travel abroad,"" Transport Minister Grant Shapps said during a BBC television interview when asked whether UK citizens should book flights in July. ""If you are booking it, you are clearly by very nature taking a chance of where the direction of this virus goes and therefore where the travel advice is in the future."" Around nine out of 10 flights have been grounded since the UK went into lockdown. At present, hotels are primed to open in early July, but as EU border restrictions are still in place, it's likely the UK will be focusing on domestic travel for now. Luxury country house hotel Beaverbrook is one of many establishments eagerly waiting to be given the go ahead to open their doors again while implementing major changes to protect guests and staff. ""We're still awaiting further clarity from the government on when the hotel can reopen, but we have been working behind the scenes to adapt our operations to ensure extra safety for both our staff and guests when we do,"" a spokesperson from the Surrey hotel told CNN Travel earlier this month. ""All visitors and staff will be required to submit a temperature check on arrival and be asked to sanitize their hands when entering all buildings on the estate. CNN's Kocha Olarn, Karla Cripps, Shivani Vora and Elinda Labropoulou also contributed to this article."
93,"'Into the Wild' bus, known as a deadly tourist lure, has been removed by air","The abandoned bus on the Stampede Trail in Alaska -- made famous by the book and film ""Into the Wild"" -- has made its first journey in decades. This time by air.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 11:31:31 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/njBbG51blls/index.html," — The abandoned bus on the Stampede Trail in Alaska -- made famous by the book and film ""Into the Wild"" -- has made its first journey in decades. This time by air. An Alaska Army National Guard CH-47 Chinook helicopter airlifted the bus, also known as the Fairbanks Bus 142 and the ""Magic Bus,"" on Thursday afternoon, the Alaska National Guard said. The decision to remove the bus in coordination with the Department of Natural Resources was made out of concern for public safety, the guard said in a statement. In its current location, near Healy, Alaska, the bus has drawn people into danger of the Alaska wilderness. It will be secured while the department considers all options for its permanent placement. Visiting the dilapidated vehicle became a kind of pilgrimage for hikers ever since Jon Krakauer's book was published in 1996; a movie adaptation was released in 2007. The nonfiction book chronicles the life of Christopher McCandless, who grew up in an affluent suburb of Washington. But after graduating from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1990, he left behind his comfortable life and headed west without telling his friends and family members. In April 1992, McCandless hitchhiked to Alaska, where a man dropped him off at the head of the Stampede Trail, according to the book. A few days later, he came upon the abandoned bus and lived there for about three months before deciding to head back to civilization. As he attempted to make his way back, he arrived at a crossing of the Teklanika River. But because the river was running fast and high from rain and the snowmelt from glaciers, he was unable to make his way across, according to Krakauer. Defeated, he turned around and headed back toward the bus, where he survived for about a month before succumbing to death in August 1992. Hikers from around the world attempt to retrace McCandless' steps every year, but many have failed and have had to be rescued. Some even died. Last February, firefighters and Alaska state troopers rescued five Italian hikers on the Stampede Trail as they were returning from visiting the abandoned bus. Less than a year before, a Belarus woman died on the trail trying to cross the Teklanika River to visit the bus with her new husband."
94,"Stay home this solstice, Stonehenge urges revelers","As the evening of 20 June approaches, so too does summer solstice.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 10:37:33 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/hLGEuko2iyo/index.html," — As the evening of 20 June approaches, so too does summer solstice. But this year, the coronavirus pandemic has cast a shadow over the event, which marks the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, and the official start of summer. One of the world's largest solstice celebrations in the world usually takes place at the sarsen rocks of Stonehenge in England, but this year, the organization which manages the site in Wiltshire, southwestern England, has asked revelers to stay home and tune in online. Usually tens of thousands would gather at the site, but English Heritage has renewed its pleas for people to enjoy the occasion from the comfort of their own homes after declaring the site closed for the celebration back in May. ""Stonehenge is currently closed due to the coronavirus pandemic so please do not travel to site for summer solstice,"" English Heritage said on Twitter on Saturday. Mass gatherings are still prohibited in the UK, which is tentatively easing lockdown restrictions after suffering one of the highest death tolls in the world so far. Even so, authorities are struggling to keep up with hastily organized parties springing up around the country, some attracting thousands of people at a time. Instead of congregating at the site, English Heritage is encouraging viewers to tune into a live streamed sunset on June 20 and sunrise on June 21, broadcast live from the precisely arranged giant stones, which date back to around 2500 BC. The June 20 sunset is at 9:26 p.m. local time, and sunrise takes place at 4:52 a.m. local time. Though the purpose of Stonehenge remains unknown to modern archeologists and historians, the layout of the famous stones is positioned in relation to the solstices and the sun's movements. Gathering at the site on the summer solstice is an age-old tradition that, under normal circumstances, thousands still observe every year. Those wanting to visit the sarsen stones won't have to wait for much longer -- according to English Heritage, the site should be open to visitors with advanced bookings from July 4."
95,Opinion: Trump's tweet exploits and defames toddlers,"So it's come to this. In a presidency debased by extraordinary and ongoing assaults on truth and the First Amendment, Donald Trump is now exploiting and defaming toddlers, to further his political goals and war on the media.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 17:02:39 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/X7xlJjkeeX0/index.html,"Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. is a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and specializes in First Amendment law.  He has represented many different news organizations, including CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. So it's come to this. In a presidency debased by extraordinary and ongoing assaults on truth and the First Amendment, Donald Trump is now exploiting and defaming toddlers, to further his political goals and war on the media. Thursday, on the eve of Juneteenth, Trump tweeted and posted on Facebook a sloppily manipulated video based on a much-loved viral clip of a pair of 2-year-old best friends running and joyfully hugging on a sidewalk. Trump's new version of the 2019 video featured fake (and misspelled) chyrons, supposedly from CNN, that read ""TERRIFIED TODLER RUNS FROM RACIST BABY"" and ""RACIST BABY PROBABLY A TRUMP VOTER,"" as one of the toddlers, who is Black, runs ahead of his friend, who is White, while ominous background music plays. The implication is that CNN had misleadingly recast a sweet encounter between two little boys through the prism of our national reckoning over racism and inequality. The patently fake video came from a pro-Trump, meme-generating Twitter account whose owner later gloated that ""Todler"" was trending on Twitter. Trump's son, Eric, also posted the manipulated video, which has been seen more than 20 million times. The real video could not have conveyed a more fundamentally different message from Trump's post. It showed the two children toddling toward each other on a New York sidewalk as quickly as they could, hugging excitedly, then running down the street together. The father who first uploaded the video to Facebook wrote that the clip of the two ""BESTIES"" was ""just so beautiful,"" and that he wished that ""we could all be like this."" Facebook took down Trump's post after a complaint from a representative of the father that it violated copyright law. Twitter first labeled the video ""manipulated"" and marked it with a blue exclamation point, under a policy that prohibits ""deceptively shar[ing] synthetic or manipulated media that are likely to cause harm."" It later disabled the video based on a copyright claim, after Trump's Tweet was liked 459,000 times. CNN, the ostensible target of the President's video smear, can fend for itself. It issued a statement that ""CNN did cover this story — but exactly as it happened."" But what about the children, whose legal rights were plainly violated — by the President of the United States himself? New York has a right of privacy law that protects what is known as the right of publicity — the right to protect one's own image and identity from exploitation by someone else. Sections 50 and 51 of New York's Civil Rights law prohibit exactly what President Trump did — the unauthorized use of a ""name, portrait or picture of any living person"" for ""advertising purposes, or for the purpose of trade."" A successful plaintiff is entitled to both an injunction to stop the violation and to money damages — including punitive damages if it is shown that the defendant ""knowingly used such person's name, portrait, picture or voice."" As New York's highest court explained in 1952, the right of privacy statute was ""born of the need to protect the individual from selfish, commercial exploitation of his personality."" Trump's misconduct falls well within the contours of this law.  He used footage of these children without consent to raise money for his presidential campaign. What he did was plainly an effort at political advertising and fundraising: tweeting what looked like a Trump campaign ad playing off two of the campaign's favorite tropes — that opposing racism is misguided, silly political correctness and that the media is evil and duplicitous. Needless to say, this tweet was not part of the President's official duties; ""presidential immunity"" won't fly here. Trump posted the video knowing it was manipulated. New York courts have ruled that such ""knowing fictionalization"" negates First Amendment protections that might otherwise protect the use of a person's image in connection with speech.  (According to his press secretary, the video was only meant to be ""satirical"" and ""funny."") The situation is somehow both absurd and mind-bogglingly offensive. Trump, who files defamation lawsuits targeting freedom of speech and of the press with impunity and wants to ""open up the libel laws"" to make it easier to sue, has now maliciously defamed a young boy by falsely suggesting he is a tiny racist. Just when you think that the despicable disinformation war being waged by President Trump and his campaign on the press and the American people can't get any lower, it somehow has. It would be poetic justice for Trump to get sued over this repulsive stunt. Those little boys have a very strong case, even though they may not know it yet. "
96,Summer solstice 2020: Sensual traditions on the longest day of the year,Call it love. Call it romance. Call it sensuality. Go ahead and call it old-fashioned lust if you want.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 04:30:33 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/FIBov8NkSG4/index.html," — Call it love. Call it romance. Call it sensuality. Go ahead and call it old-fashioned lust if you want. But whatever you call it, the summer solstice for 2020 is arriving -- and it has a history of stirring hearts and libidos. The longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere kicks off the official start of summer and with it, the bounty of the harvest. So it should come as no surprise that the solstice is linked to fertility -- both of the plant and human variety -- in destinations around the world. CNN Travel explores some of those long-standing summer traditions. But first, we'll take a look at the science of a solstice and what's special in 2020. Summer solstice: Q&A Question: I like precision. Exactly when is the summer solstice in 2020? It will happen at 21:43 UTC (Universal Coordinated Time) on Saturday, June 20. If you're in the Eastern Time Zone of the United States, that's 5:43 p.m. June 20. But if you happen to live in Tokyo, for instance, your precise summer solstice moment actually happens at 6:43 a.m. on Sunday, June 21. In fact, all of Asia will observe the solstice on June 21. Berlin, Germany, in Central Europe barely falls on the June 20 date at 11:43 p.m. local time. The website TimeandDate has a handy tool to let you calculate the time for where you'll be. Question: It's the longest day of the year -- and it happens all over the world? Nope. It's the longest day only in the Northern Hemisphere. It's the shortest day of the year south of the equator. They are about to welcome three months of winter there. And the differences in how much daylight you get become very dramatic as you get closer to the poles and farther from the equator. For instance, residents of northerly St. Petersburg, Russia, will get a 3:35 a.m. sunrise and almost 19 hours of light. Even the night doesn't get that dark. In Singapore, a Northern Hemisphere city-state but one just barely above the equator, people barely notice the difference. They get a measly extra 11 minutes of daylight. As for those poor penguins in Antarctica guarding their eggs -- if they could talk, they could tell you a lot about living in 24-hour darkness. Question: Why don't we just get 12 hours of daylight all year? Folks all over the planet actually did get equal doses of day and night back during the spring equinox on March 20. But the amount of sunlight we get in the Northern Hemisphere has been increasing daily ever since. Why? That's because the Earth is aligned on an axis, an imaginary pole going through the center of our planet. But this axis tilts -- at an angle of 23.5 degrees. ""As Earth orbits the sun [once each year], its tilted axis always points in the same direction. So, throughout the year, different parts of Earth get the sun's direct rays,"" according to NASA. When the sun reaches its apex in the Northern Hemisphere, that's the summer solstice. At that time, ""the sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer, which is located at 23.5° latitude North, and runs through Mexico, the Bahamas, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, India and southern China,"" according to the National Weather Service. Bonus for 2020: Annular eclipse It's going to be a really big celestial weekend for some people in the Eastern Hemisphere. In addition to the solstice, they will get to witness an annular eclipse. (Using proper eye protection, of course). On Sunday, the new moon will pass between the Earth and the sun, blocking it out minus a fiery ring on the edges. An annular eclipse differs from a total eclipse, in which the entire sun is blocked. A new moon is simply too far away from Earth to completely obscure the sun's disc in an annular eclipse. People in the Western Hemisphere will just have to settle for a good solstice as it will be nighttime in their part of the world when the annular eclipse occurs. Sensual traditions: Midsummer in Sweden But let's turn our attention to what's really on our minds -- the romance of the solstice. We'll start in Sweden. Their traditions include dancing around a maypole -- a symbol which some view as phallic -- and feasting on herring and copious amounts of vodka. ""A lot of children are born nine months after Midsummer in Sweden,"" Jan-Öjvind Swahn, a Swedish ethnologist and the author of several books on the subject, told CNN before his death in 2016. ""Drinking is the most typical Midsummer tradition. There are historical pictures of people drinking to the point where they can't go on anymore,"" said Swahn. While the libations have a hand in the subsequent baby boom, Swahn pointed out that even without the booze, Midsummer is a time rich in romantic ritual. ""There used to be a tradition among unmarried girls, where if they ate something very salty during Midsummer, or else collected several different kinds of flowers and put these under their pillow when they slept, they would dream of their future husbands,"" he said. Pagan rites in Greece There is a similar mythology about dreaming of one's future spouse in parts of Greece. There, as in many European countries, the pagan solstice got co-opted by Christianity and rebranded as St. John's Day.  Still, in many villages in the country's north, the ancient rites are still celebrated. One of the oldest rituals is called Klidonas, and it involves local virgins gathering water from the sea. The village's unmarried women all place a personal belonging in the pot and leave it under a fig tree overnight, where -- folklore has it -- the magic of the day imbues the objects with prophetic powers, and the girls in question dream of their future husbands. The next day, all the women in the village gather, and take turns pulling out objects and reciting rhyming couplets that are meant to predict the romantic fortunes of the item's owner. These days, however, the festival is more an excuse for the community of women to exchange bawdy jokes. ""In my village, the older women always seem to come up with the dirtiest rhymes,"" says Eleni Fanariotou, who has filmed the custom. Later in the day, the sexes mingle and take turns jumping over a bonfire. Anyone who succeeds in jumping over the flames three times is meant to have a wish granted. Fanariotou said the festival often results in coupling. ""It's a good time to meet someone, because all the young people in the village go, and it's a good opportunity to socialize. Plus, all the men like to show off, and make the biggest fire they can to jump through."" Yoga in India Few things get you in touch with your mind -- and your body -- like yoga does. In India, where they definitely know their yoga, the summer solstice is traditionally celebrated with mass yoga sessions. According to the summersolstice.blog, they do this ""for strength, for happiness, for love, for forgiveness and for correcting mistakes done in past."" In fact, the International Day of Yoga is June 21, the same day as the solstice in India. Like many other things in 2020, this year will be different because of the coronavirus pandemic. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is encouraging people to avoid the traditional mass events and to do their yoga sessions just with family, according to NDTV. A Slavic Cupid In Eastern Europe, solstice celebrations fall on Ivan Kupala Day -- a holiday with romantic connotations for many Slavs (""kupala"" is derived from the same word as ""cupid""). In 2020, Ivan Kupala Day starts on the evening of July 6 and ends of the evening of July 7. ""It was once believed that Kupala night was a time for people to fall in love, and that those celebrating it would be happy and prosperous throughout the year,"" recalls Agnieszka Bigaj from the Polish tourist board. It used to be that young, unmarried women would float floral wreaths in the river where eager bachelors on the other side would try to catching the flowers. she adds. According to Polish folklore, the man and woman in question would become a couple. Bonfires are also a large feature of the holiday, and it's tradition for a couple to leap through the flames together while holding hands -- if they don't let go, it is said their love will last. Stonehenge One of the largest annual solstice celebrations in the world takes place at Stonehenge in England, where thousands usually gather each year. Like many other events in 2020, it's having to alter traditions because of the pandemic. While the usual in-person gathering is on hold, you'll be able to live stream sunset on June 20 and sunrise on June 21 at the site of these precisely arranged giant stones on English Heritage's Facebook page. Talk about a short night. The June 20 sunset is at 9:26 p.m. local time, and sunrise will start at a very early 4:52 a.m. local time, so be sure use an online time zone converter if you want to watch either or both. Dating back to druid and pagan times, Stonehenge has allure. ""All druid rituals have an element of fertility, and the solstice is no exception,"" King Arthur Pendragon, a senior archdruid, told CNN. ""We celebrate the union of the male and female deities -- the S\sun and the Earth -- on the longest day of the year.""

98,Think that buried treasure was a fake? He has the photos to prove it wasn't,"As soon as Forrest Fenn announced that his treasure was found earlier this month, rumors swirled about whether it had really been found or if the treasure hunt had been a hoax all along.","Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:33:55 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/cWIF9pSGQzw/index.html," — As soon as Forrest Fenn announced that his treasure was found earlier this month, rumors swirled about whether it had really been found or if the treasure hunt had been a hoax all along. Well, this week, Fenn tried to put some of those to rest by unveiling the first photos of the discovered treasure. On Tuesday, the 89-year-old art and antiquities collector posted three pictures of the treasure on dalneitzel.com, a fan blog dedicated to the treasure hunt that Fenn sparked 10 years ago after he published clues in his autobiography ""The Thrill of the Chase."" One photo shows Fenn sorting through the bronze chest filled with gold, jewelry and other artifacts that are believed to total over $1 million. ""Removing objects from the chest. It is darker than it was ten years ago when I left it on the ground and walked away,"" Fenn wrote in the caption. Another photo shows the treasure ""not long after it was discovered,"" according to Fenn. And a third picture shows a picture of him wearing a silver bracelet that has been tarnished black. Fenn announced that the decade-long adventure for the treasure had come to an end on June 6, after a man from ""back East"" had discovered it. ""It was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago,"" Fenn wrote on his website at the time. ""I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot."" Fenn estimated that as many as 350,000 people from around the world went hunting for the treasure, according to the Santa Fe New Mexican. Some quit their jobs to fully dedicate their lives to the hunt and some even died. Fenn reiterated in Tuesday's post that the finder wanted to remain anonymous. While some remained skeptical, most of the comments under the pictures congratulated the finder and thanked Fenn for the experience. ""I give a heartfelt thank you to Forrest for his wild and wonderful adventure that gave me new places to explore, peacefulness, joy, wonder, and a challenge like no other,"" one person commented."
99,Brands have been ignoring people of color for too long. He's on a mission to change that.,"Editor's Note: The content in this story is part of a ""Risk Takers"" TV special. It airs on CNN on Saturday, June 20 at 2:30 pm ET.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 14:16:57 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/LBBcN4N5EaU/index.html,"Editor's Note: The content in this story is part of a ""Risk Takers"" TV special. It airs on CNN on Saturday, June 20 at 2:30 pm ET. For decades, companies making beauty and personal care products catered almost exclusively to white consumers' needs. What few products were created for people of color typically were relegated to a small ""ethnic beauty"" section in stores. In 2013, Tristan Walker set out to change that by founding Walker & Company Brands. Its mission: to meet the health and beauty needs of people of color on a global scale. Through his success -- his company became a subsidiary of Procter & Gamble in 2018 -- Walker has sought to educate investors and other consumer product makers about the opportunities to expand their businesses. They've been ignoring a huge market, he says, especially given projections that by 2045, non-Hispanic whites will no longer make up the majority of the US population. ""We have an audience that has not been served in over 100 years as well as they deserve to be. ... If the majority of the world represents this audience, why aren't you serving them?"" he said in a recent interview with CNN Business' Rachel Crane. When asked if he believed other retailers should follow Sephora's lead and dedicate 15% of their shelf space to products from black-owned companies, Walker replied, ""It's a great start, I hope to see more of it."" But he also encouraged brands to be bolder than that. ""Why only 15%? When I think about folks of color being the majority of this country in 20, 30 years -- why not kind of push for that future? Can more than half of the store represent the need for this growing audience?"" The same question might be put to corporate America, which in the wake of George Floyd's killing is under pressure to finally reckon with the racism and exclusion that has held back African-Americans and other minority employees for decades. Walker said he's heartened to hear companies taking a strong stand against racism. But to make real change going forward he recommends they first acknowledge the trauma black employees face daily in relation to justice and equity. Then take a hard look at what the company's stated values are and whether its decisions and actions are really in line with them. ""This isn't only about just donating to a few organizations, it's actually following up. Are you hiring folks who represent the audience that you're serving? Are you putting folks on your boards who represent the audience that you're serving?"" "
100,Everyone you know uses Zoom. That wasn't the plan,The tweet was when Eric Yuan knew something had to change.,"Fri, 22 May 2020 19:54:55 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/s9NIICmmXKc/index.html,"The tweet was when Eric Yuan knew something had to change. Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, shared a photo from his first ever virtual cabinet meeting. The cybersecurity red flags jumped out immediately. Some cabinet secretaries' Zoom screen names were visible, you could see which platform the cabinet was running its computers on, and most glaringly, the meeting ID was visible for all to see. The significance of the moment was not lost on the team at Zoom. ""That was the big aha moment,"" Zoom board member Santi Subotovsky told CNN Business. Zoom grew into a vastly profitable business selling software to businesses that could enable a venture capital firm to seamlessly take virtual pitch meetings from around the globe or an executive to deliver an all-hands to a remote workforce. Powering British Cabinet meetings was never on the radar. ""Our company that used to be a 100% enterprise-focused, is now powering the world. It's powering governments, education, social activities... And then when the other shoe dropped, it's like we need to get ready for that,"" Subotovsky said. Zoom was already enmeshed in controversy. Less than two weeks earlier, The New York Times had raised the flag on ""Zoombombing,"" opening the door to a flood of scrutiny, from its feeding data into Facebook to the New York State Attorney General scrutinizing its data practices. But for Eric Yuan, the 50-year-old founder and CEO of Zoom, it was the Johnson tweet that changed everything. ""This was our wake-up call,"" Yuan told CNN Business over a Zoom interview from his San Jose home. Yuan blames himself for not anticipating that users might want to share a screenshot of a meeting. For his business clients, sharing a screenshot of your board meeting would be unthinkable. But business clients weren't his only worry anymore. The world had become his customer. Within a week, Zoom pushed out an update that would hide the meeting ID from view. But for Yuan and his team at Zoom, the damage had only just begun. Yuan built Zoom to please his customers — to use Zoom-speak he wanted to ""deliver happiness"" — and for years that meant giving his business clients a high-quality video conferencing platform that was easy-to-use. ""Frictionless,"" as the company likes to say. But during a global pandemic that has transformed Zoom into an essential tool for schools, church groups, weddings, and the cabinet of a G7 economy, Yuan is trying to figure out how to make Zoom something it was never meant to be. Now, ""Zoom is not only a business communication company, suddenly it's becoming an infrastructure company,"" Yuan said. Since the pandemic, Yuan has had little time to enjoy his family's multiplying fortune ($8 billion at last count, according to Forbes). He refers to this time as the most stressful weeks of his life, which now consists of three things: Zooming, eating and sleeping, and he's barely been doing much of the last one. ""I've had several sleepless nights"" Yuan said in front of a virtual background with the words ""WE CARE"" hovering over a heart-shaped earth. What is the question keeping the CEO of the company — one that is now worth more than General Motors —up at night? Yuan takes a breath. ""How did we get here?"" Shandong to Silicon Valley Yuan grew up in the Shandong Province in China in what he describes as a middle-class family. The child of geological engineers, Yuan was an average student who studied computer science, and after a stint working in Japan, decided he wanted to come to the center of technological innovation: Silicon Valley. ""I wanted to embrace that first wave of internet revolution,"" Yuan said. Yuan applied for an H-1B visa to come to America but was rejected. And then rejected again. And again. In what has now become part of his founder's lore, Yuan applied eight times before being accepted into the United States. Yuan entered Silicon Valley in 1997, during the first internet boom. Entranced by fast-growing companies like Netscape and Yahoo, who were revolutionizing the world's communications, Yuan wanted to get in on the ground floor of a bustling startup. He found it at WebEx, a young company — he was among the first 20 hires — whose goal was to leverage rapidly increasing bandwidth capabilities into online meetings where you could share your desktop screen easily and cheaply. Yuan, who was 27 years old at the time of his arrival, fit into the global workforce of WebEx — a significant number of Chinese immigrants were recruited alongside Yuan — but found himself stymied by his inability to speak English. While he could understand the conversations around him, he says he couldn't participate. ""I couldn't join a marketing team or a sales team,"" said Yuan. ""I had to go back to writing code."" Yuan's former colleagues associate Yuan's limited English (he still has a thick Chinese accent) with him being repeatedly overlooked. ""I saw a tremendous amount of unconscious bias against Eric because he didn't look the part, he didn't sound the part,"" says David Knight, a former VP of Product Management at WebEx. ""We put so much stock in how people communicate. We ascribe their eloquence to be their intelligence."" While Yuan couldn't control how others understood his English, he focused on what he could control: his work. ""I knew two things from my father: keep working hard, stay humble, and someday you'll be OK,"" Yuan said. The WebEx years WebEx was founded by two immigrants: Subrah Iyar came from India and ran marketing and sales, while Min Zhu, a Stanford-educated immigrant from China, was in charge of technical development. Both became mentors for Yuan. WebEx's early days were similar to many startups in the Valley: a flat, diffuse hierarchy that rewarded long hours from a loyal staff intent on changing the world. ""We were very scrappy,"" said Ed Wong, a friend of Yuan who worked as a product manager with him at WebEx. Unlike other product-focused companies, WebEx sold itself as a cheap cloud-based ""SaaS"" (software as a service) that only required you to download its product: no expensive hardware purchases necessary. ""Your economics had to be different,"" explained Subrah Iyar to CNN Business. ""The price point for SaaS meant that you didn't get too much money upfront, you got it on a monthly basis."" That SaaS model put tremendous pressure on the employees of WebEx to continually service and respond to their customer's demands. Companies were taking risks moving meetings and events online and any disruption in that service was seen by the WebEx team as an existential threat. ""Nobody thinks of web conferencing as mission critical. But when a meeting goes south and you've got eight or ten executives on the call, it's a big deal,"" said Knight. ""If WebEx was down for five minutes, I would spend the next month traveling and meeting customers, explaining to them why it happened and why it wouldn't happen again,"" said Velchamy Sankarlingam who worked alongside Yuan as an engineer at WebEx. ""If your service goes down, you're going to get churn. People are going to switch away."" Yuan proved his worth to Iyar and Zhu, rising to lead the engineering team as the company's fortunes grew. First there was the RuPaul Superbowl ad in 2000, then a successful IPO later that year. WebEx even received an unlikely boost after 9/11. Amid global panic, companies who didn't want their employees flying unnecessarily instead turned to a service that could enable cheap and easy virtual meetings. And because WebEx was built on the cloud, Yuan and his engineering team's software could scale and meet the increasing demand. After first fielding an offer from IBM, Iyar and the WebEx board decided to sell their company in 2007 to Cisco for $3.2 billion. Yuan, who was so attached to WebEx that he referred to it as ""his baby,"" now found himself an employee of the one of the largest technology companies in the world. From fast-growing startup to a 'rounding error' Thanks to the Cisco acquisition, Yuan became a rich man. But while some WebEx employees took their earnings and split — wary of making the transition from fast-growing startup to cog in a Fortune 500 corporation — Yuan stuck around. It was still his baby after all. ""He wasn't ready to leave yet. He had a lot of loyalty,"" said David Knight, a VP at WebEx at the time of the acquisition. But, that loyalty was quickly tested. ""Almost immediately they started to dismiss everything that we did,"" said Matt Sheppard, then a WebEx employee. ""Eric was dismissed, along with the other leadership at WebEx, as being kind of second rate."" But still, Yuan stayed. ""Every time I felt like leaving, I just got emotional,"" said Yuan, who worked at Cisco for four years. Former WebEx employees who made the transition to Cisco describe a key philosophical difference in how the two companies handled their customers. While WebEx's SaaS business model required them to serve their customers 24/7, Cisco made its billions selling physical routers and switches. ""It's a completely different mindset,"" said Sankarlingam. ""Cisco just sells the gear. And after that it's up to your network ... if a company's network goes down, nobody's going to go blame Cisco."" WebEx, once a fast-growing startup, now was a cog in a blue-chip behemoth. ""We were a rounding error in Cisco's business,"" Knight said. Yuan felt for the first time that he couldn't satisfy his customers. He says his WebEx customers grew frustrated with the quality of the product. They wanted WebEx to work reliably and more intuitively. And above all else, they wanted video to run seamlessly. ""He was sincere, almost naïve in that he always cared about the WebEx customers and that they were not being attended to,"" said Iyar, who was often told by Yuan that he should have never sold the company. Yuan would confide in Iyar that he felt like he was betraying the customer-obsessed ideals he learned at WebEx. ""He had the advantage, in retrospect, that that's the only thing he grew up with, right? In a sense, one of his strengths is that he's a purist to that model,"" said Iyar. For Yuan, his time at Cisco turned out to be invaluable: it transformed him from engineer to entrepreneur. Yuan's frustrations at Cisco ""sparked the flames in his fire that he became very competitive,"" said Sheppard. Founding Zoom ""was purely a reaction to them not listening to him."" A Cisco spokesperson told CNN Business in a statement that the WebEx acquisition was a ""very important one for us and changed the way the world works. We thank Eric for his time at Cisco."" Zoom founding Yuan left Cisco in 2011, along with around 40 China-based WebEx engineers. Initial funding for his new company came from his acquaintances and former colleagues, including Subrah Iyar. ""If he told me he was sending a person to Mars I would have put money in,"" recalls Iyar. With funding and staff in place, Yuan could launch his new baby: Zoom. The pitch was simple. Build a better WebEx. ""He didn't try and revolutionize it. He just made it better and cheaper and higher quality and simpler and video-centered,"" said Knight, who left WebEx shortly before Yuan. Yuan's plan to capture WebEx's enterprise market relied on building Zoom video-first. It would be cloud-based, run on Macs and PCs, iPhones and Androids, and you could make it work without downloading any software in your browser. But above all else, Yuan wanted to make his customers happy. ""I wanted to join a company where I woke up every morning and felt happy: I wanted to build a better solution to deliver happiness to the WebEx customers,"" said Yuan. ""That's it."" AT&T, which owns CNN's parent company WarnerMedia, offers business customers Cisco's WebEx collaboration software, which competes with Zoom. 'The Holy Grail' It turns out, what makes the customers of video conferencing happy is the things they don't have to think about. No one wants to download an app or sign up for an account if they don't have to. They just want the thing to work. But ask any engineer and they'll tell you that making a simple product is never simple. ""You have to build a lot of discipline into the product,"" Oded Gal, a former WebEx veteran who now works alongside Yuan at Zoom as its Chief Product Officer, told CNN Business. Just as WebEx built a cutting-edge screensharing platform off the new bandwidth enabled by the DSL and T1 lines of the 1990s, Zoom would be built off the advanced data networks capable of streaming HD video. ""Video was not possible in the 2000s because the bandwidth was not there,"" said Iyer. ""That was changing."" In a Zoom call, each user can upload upwards of two streams (one for video, one for screensharing) to a cloud server which then compresses each stream, adjusts the output for the bandwidth and CPU capability of each computer or phone, and sends them back, with as low a latency as possible. Multiply that by up to 100 users, and the problem becomes exponentially more complicated. ""You don't know what you don't see, you just experience the end result,"" said Iyar. ""Everybody thinks video conferencing is easy and it turns out the tech is really hard to do,"" says Knight. ""You don't control the network, you don't control the ISP, you don't control whether somebody turns the microwave on and interferes with the WiFi."" While figuring out how to make scalable video calls was a daunting challenge, for Yuan's Zoom team, it was only half the battle. They also had to make Zoom frictionless enough that anyone could use it. So easy that it makes his customers happy. Zoom could work in any browser. It wouldn't need you to adjust your firewall settings. And unlike WebEx meetings, with their hard-to-remember pins and meeting IDs, Zoom would be accessible with a simple link. ""Getting rid of that user friction... in the tech world, it's kind of the holy grail,"" said Beth Kindig, technology analyst at beth.technology. Zoom spreads Yuan's new baby was up and running. Yuan's plan for Zoom was to pilfer off WebEx's customers. To attract new users, Zoom began offering a freemium version of its product. Meetings under 40 minutes with up to 100 users would be free to use. Yuan's bet was that as more users tried Zoom, businesses would see that it worked better than WebEx, and would end up paying to switch to his new product. Zoom's freemium model gave it an entrance into a crowded marketplace where its competition were some of the largest companies in the world. Of course, there was Cisco's WebEx, but Zoom was also up against Microsoft and Google. But while companies might have had established deals with WebEx, Zoom's freemium accounts meant that the employees at those companies could just use Zoom. ""Everyone had Cisco WebEx, or they had Microsoft Suites,"" said Kindig. ""But everyone used Zoom because of how easy it was to just send out that link."" Live from Zoom, it's 'Saturday Night Live!' Zoom was winning. Yuan's freemium strategy worked and tech companies, entranced by Zoom's simplicity and efficiency, signed up for premium Zoom subscriptions. In a few short years, Zoom found itself the video conferencing market leader, and, after a successful 2019 IPO, Yuan became a billionaire multiple times over. Yuan's baby was all grown up. But a funny thing happened on the way to dominating the B2B remote video conferencing market: a global pandemic turned Zoom into a household name. With the world shutting down in a matter of weeks, every institution, every school, every college, every family now found themselves in desperate need of a way to communicate. ""You don't go into a pandemic with the video conferencing solution you wish you had. You go into the pandemic with the video conferencing solution you have,"" said Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab. Over a mindboggling month of coronavirus-fueled growth — according to Zoom, its traffic is up 3,000% since December — Zoom unexpectedly joined Google, Kleenex and Band-Aid in the hallowed branding pantheon of proprietary eponyms. ""You free to Zoom?"" a phrase that would have been incomprehensible to the vast majority of us a couple of months ago, became an invitation your grandparents understood. And during an unprecedented spike in traffic, Zoom's cloud network, built on AWS and Oracle, scaled up to meet the crushing demand. Yuan's obsessions — his focus on video, on ease-of-use, on building scalable architecture — all paid off, and amid a cratering global market, Zoom's stock surged over 200%. But as Zoom transitioned from IT departments to ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon"" and 10 Downing Street, security researchers began to dig into this newly ubiquitous company. Was this easy-enough-for-anyone-to-use product actually safe for any of us to use? 'Speed at the expense of all else' The hits came quick. First it was ""Zoombombing."" Then Zoom's encryption was discovered to be inadequate and its data was found to be routed through Chinese servers. Its privacy policy was picked apart. Lawsuits were filed, New York Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter asking whether the company ""is taking appropriate steps to ensure users' privacy and security,"" and institutions like NASA, New York City schools, and SpaceX banned their employees from using Zoom. Zoom says that the problems stem from its overnight transformation into an infrastructure company for the world. Before, Zoom expected its business customer base to have security teams who would enable best practices, like enabling passwords by default. Yuan wrote a blog stating that the servers located in China were an accident due to the surge in traffic, and Zoom data would not be routed through them again. ""[Yuan] realized that he has to be the IT department, the compliance department for the world, which I don't think he signed up,"" said Yuan's old mentor, Iyar. Zoom acted swiftly, quickly patching uncovered security vulnerabilities, purchasing Keybase, an encryption startup, instituting a 90-day product freeze, and hiring Alex Stamos, former chief security officer at Facebook, and Lea Kissner, formerly the global lead of privacy technology at Google to bolster its security team. It has since come to an agreement with Attorney General James, and New York City public schools are now permitting its use. When you begin to examine Zoom's security vulnerabilities, a theme emerges. ""A lot of the security issues we saw seem to be the result of choices made that privileged user experience over security,"" said Marczak, who was part of the Citizen Lab team that uncovered security vulnerabilities in Zoom. ""You get this clear pattern where it looks like there were these vulnerabilities that were caused by decisions made to increase speed at the expense of all else."" Marczak helped uncover a vulnerability in Zoom's ""waiting room."" The waiting room is the first step of a password protected meeting, where the host could choose to let people in. Marczak and his colleague John Scott-Railton discovered that Zoom was sending an encrypted stream of the meeting to those not-yet-accepted. A savvy user could scoop up that data and spy on the meeting, ""presumably, so that when you were admitted the video would show instantly,"" explains Marczak. Or, take the Boris Johnson photo. Having the meeting ID visible on the top-left corner of the screen was an intentional choice to make Zoom's customers not have to dig around menus to find a meeting ID. ""We wanted it to be easier for the end user to let others join,"" Yuan said. But having a visible meeting ID meant that a screenshot posted on social media would allow anyone to enter the ID and join in (assuming that the meeting was not password protected).  ""Did we think about privacy? No, that's the problem,"" Yuan said. 'His product did so well, it broke' Zoom's security and privacy problems aren't Yuan's only concerns. After news that Facebook is entering the video conferencing game, Zoom's stock dropped 12%, which was on the heels of news that Verizon was buying Zoom's rival BlueJeans. Zoom's long-standing ties to China are also becoming an increasing liability. The company has utilized Chinese developers from its onset — its R&D department in China has over 700 employees — a practice that Zoom warned in its annual report ""could expose us to market scrutiny regarding the integrity of our solution or data security features."" In April, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi erroneously referred to Zoom as a ""Chinese entity,"" while rejecting the idea of a Zoom enabled remote Congressional session. (Zoom is an American-based company, headquartered in San Jose). Yuan admitted to CNN that as tensions between China and the United States rise, Zoom might have to adjust its long-standing ties to China, suggesting Denver, Ohio or Virginia as possible sites for a relocated Zoom R&D center. ""If things get worse, we do have a plan,"" said Yuan. Meanwhile, the safety of Zoom has remained a controversial subject amongst security researchers. ""Zoom is Malware,"" reads one headline, while a trio of security researchers published ""Zoom isn't Malware,"" offering a number of steps to bolster up security for the average user. And while Zoom's continued public lashing is ongoing, it could end up helping them in the long run. ""I think that probably a lot of CEOs are envious of his position,"" said Kindig. ""His product did so well, it broke."" ""Thank you, Zoom, for listening,"" wrote Doc Searls, a technology journalist who had been highly critical of Zoom's privacy policies.  ""At least in public, they're taking all the right steps,"" echoed Marczak. Yuan says the scrutiny that Zoom has received has been a blessing in disguise, allowing him to improve his company in ways that he never could have imagined otherwise. He now devotes his entire day only to security and privacy matters. ""The harshest criticism may be the best words you ever hear,"" Yuan muses. Even in response to Nancy Pelosi wrongly describing Zoom as a ""Chinese entity"" Yuan blames himself. ""If the world misunderstands us, then I don't blame others, it's our problem... We are a very proud American company. The company is a public Nasdaq company, headquartered in San Jose. I'm a Chinese American. I truly believe... as long as you do the right thing, sooner or later they will know it... just be patient."" ""In ten to twenty years, when people write the history of Covid-19, I want them to write that Zoom did the right thing for the world,"" Yuan said. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said that Zhu was still with WebEx when it was sold to Cisco. "

The report, from cybersecurity firm Awake Security, found at least 111 ""malicious or fake"" Chrome extensions capable of taking screenshots, stealing login credentials and capturing passwords as users typed them. The campaign impacted a wide range of sectors including financial services, healthcare and government organizations, it added. Extensions allow users to add features and capabilities to their browsers, such as a recently popular one that allows multiple laptops to stream Netflix shows simultaneously and another from Google that lets users flag suspicious websites. But the new report highlights the potential for fraudulent extensions to do harm and compromise a wide variety of systems. ""The actors behind these activities have established a persistent foothold in almost every network,"" researchers at Awake said. Google confirmed that all the browser extensions flagged by Awake have since been removed. ""We appreciate the work of the research community, and when we are alerted of extensions ... that violate our policies, we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses,"" Google spokesperson Scott Westover said in a statement provided to CNN Business. ""We do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques, code, and behaviors, and take down those extensions if they violate our policies."" Awake linked all the extensions associated with the spying campaign back to Galcomm, an Israeli web hosting company that claims to manage around 250,000 browser domains. ""By exploiting the trust placed in it as a domain registrar, Galcomm has enabled malicious activity that has been found across more than a hundred networks we've examined,"" Awake researchers said in the report, adding that they found more than 15,000 Galcomm domains that were ""malicious or suspicious."" ""Galcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,"" Moshe Fogel told Reuters, which was first to report on Awake's findings. After this story published, Galcomm refuted parts of Awake's report, saying 25% of the domains Awake claimed to have checked were not Galcomm domains or had been deleted. The Israeli firm also said Awake had not sought its input before publishing the report. ""The report is at least irresponsible, if not worse,"" Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel said in an email to CNN Business. ""We are considering our steps and actions against Awake."" Google did not comment on Galcomm's role in the campaign. Google Chrome extensions have been linked to cyberattacks in the past, including as recently as February this year. The company has taken several steps to improve the browser's privacy and security protections, Westover said. ""In addition to disabling the accounts of developers that violate our policies, we also flag certain malicious patterns we detect in order to prevent extensions from returning,"" he added. "
102,Trump isn't aging well,Donald Trump is not coping well.,"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:59:58 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/nHphi1_V9c4/index.html,"Michael D'Antonio is the author of the book ""Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success"" and co-author with Peter Eisner of ""The Shadow President: The Truth About Mike Pence."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Donald Trump is not coping well. As he turned 74 last weekend, the oldest man ever to assume the presidency got all defensive about how he looked walking down a ramp at West Point. In truth, his slow-mo shuffle didn't reveal anything that should embarrass a senior citizen. What was truly troubling was what Trump revealed the next day, when he shouted on Twitter: ""THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER!!!"" The tweet harked back to Richard Nixon, who was president when the term ""silent majority"" was first used in 1969. It revealed how even in these troubled times, with the pandemic death toll passing 115,000 and citizens crying out for an end to police violence against minorities, the President is stuck in the past, out of step with a country that has changed practically overnight. Some of the change is evident in the streets, where citizens of every race, religion, ethnicity and age group have joined a nationwide protest movement that recognizes police violence against African Americans and insists that Black Lives Matter. More proof of a changed society can be found in a recent Gallup poll that found four-in-10 support some aspects of socialism. Trump even seems to be losing the support of high-ranking military leaders as he refuses to consider renaming bases named for Confederate officers who waged war against the United States. Trump is so incapable of adapting to change that he's been lapped by NASCAR: It recently banned the Confederate flag, which has long been waved by fans at its tracks. Even the National Football League, which engaged in a long row with players who knelt to protest racial injustice as the National Anthem was played, has reversed field. Locked in his increasingly isolated social and political views, Trump sticks to his old tricks, like calling on the ""silent majority"" because he's apparently incapable of seeing modern America. For those who don't remember, or never learned about the term's origin, the ""silent majority"" was first invoked by President Nixon to argue that most Americans supported the war in Vietnam. In fact, polls done at the time showed that most believed the country's involvement in Vietnam had been a mistake. Similarly wrong was Nixon's claim that his ""majority"" was silent. Pro-war Americans argued their side of things in political debates and kitchen-table discussions. They paraded and rallied, and a few would join in an organized attack -- the Hard Hat Riot of 1970 -- on anti-war activists. If the phrase ""silent majority"" was so inaccurate, what about it would appeal to Trump? Well, it's not that he was all for America's war effort. As Trump told interviewer Piers Morgan he ""was never a fan"" of the war. It's more likely that, as a marketing expert, the reality TV host who made ""You're fired!"" his catch phrase loves the way that Nixon's two-word term communicated so much to his political base. Nixon's silent majority was, everyone knew, middle class, middle-aged, Christian, white and conservative, and they supported him. As Trump leans on the term he reveals himself to be not only nostalgic, which is always a hazard for the aging, but a victim of another common problem among older folks: inflexibility. To be clear, this problem can afflict people of all ages, and it's also true that many seniors possess nimble minds. However, Trump has long shown he is rigidly attached to a bygone era, and has demonstrated an inability to recognize change and adapt to it. Take, for example, the political injury he suffered when he scheduled a rally for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. As much of America knows, the date marks the annual Juneteenth celebration of African Americans' emancipation. (The name derives from the day when Union forces notified slaves in Texas that they were free.) Long recognized in black communities, the celebration of Juneteenth has gained popularity in most corners of the nation. Last year the Republican National Committee marked the day with a proclamation. Trump's Senate ally Tim Scott has said the President didn't understand the significance of Juneteenth (he changed the date of the rally when people pointed it out). This is a sign of a man living in an isolated past. So, too, is Trump's selection of Tulsa for his campaign rally. Tulsa is the site of what has been called the worst racial massacre in US history. White mobs burned more than 1,000 black homes and businesses. Deaths were estimated at between 100 and 300. For Trump to pick Tulsa, especially when the country is in the middle of coast-to-coast protests over police violence against black Americans, reflects either a colossal lack of awareness or monstrous cruelty. The way Trump acts and speaks often makes him look like a mean old man. Take his administration's decision to change the rules so health insurance companies can discriminate against transgender people. Many larger insurers opposed the change, which was announced on Saturday. Two days later, the Supreme Court ruled that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination against gay and transgender people. This Supreme Court is never on the leading edge of radical change, but even the justices seated on this court -- six of whom qualify for Medicare -- showed they understand America in a way that the president does not. Our President's inflexible mind is on display every time he calls out for ""law and order"" in response to civil rights protests that are overwhelmingly peaceful and supported by great majorities of Americans. (Perhaps Trump's mind is stuck in the 60s.) He did himself a similar disservice when during a recent press conference where he was questioned by female reporters he appeared to muse nostalgically about the days when women were meek and retiring. Again, we must all recognize that Trump's rigidity says nothing about all older people. (Follow the 84-year-old Dalai Lama on Twitter and you'll see what I mean.) However, in the President's case the inability to adapt does seem to be the sign of a man who is not aging well. He appears even more defensive and reactionary than he was when he was elected. And like an out-of-touch founder of a business he's no longer capable of running, he could do a whole lot of damage on his way out the door.  "
103,"Coronavirus waivers, immunity bills are a mistake","As America reopens, business owners wonder how much physical protection to provide for themselves, their employees and their guests. Patrons wonder whether it'll be safe to go out to eat, to shop or walk into an office.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 23:14:17 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/YH8XeupJ4cU/index.html,"Shanin Specter is a founding partner at Kline & Specter, PC and a professor of law. Watch him this Saturday on Smerconish at 9 a.m. ET on CNN. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. As America reopens, business owners wonder how much physical protection to provide for themselves, their employees and their guests. Patrons wonder whether it'll be safe to go out to eat, to shop or walk into an office. With immunity bills for businesses under legislative consideration and President Donald Trump's campaign foisting waivers on people attending his upcoming rally, you might wonder whether you need medical and legal degrees to protect yourself. The short answer to all of this is: just follow the rules. The rules are easily accessed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has guidelines. They revolve around basics like social distancing, wearing a face mask, cleaning of surfaces and hands and common sense. State and local governments have issued health orders, with the force of law. Many pivot off CDC guidelines and vary depending on local virus prevalence. In some places, work must be done remotely if possible. If you run a business, it's close to a sure thing that if you follow the rules you won't be successfully sued. Compliance with detailed government guidelines and laws is nearly always a successful defense. The law requires reasonable care, not perfection. If someone gets sick despite your reasonable care, liability is unlikely to follow. What about waivers? They're a bad idea. First, a signed form providing that a patron won't sue even if the business was negligent is unenforceable in most states, as it's considered against the public interest. Second, the form itself sends the wrong message. It discourages reasonable care by owners and staff. It suggests that the business isn't operating safely. And it's a turnoff to an already jittery public. How about immunities? They're bad too. A law that says that a business is immune from lawsuits is a government blessing for bad behavior. Like a waiver, it encourages a lack of due care. And as with a waiver, it punishes someone victimized by another's fault by denying them their day in court. What makes more sense is a positive statement. Businesses should consider communicating safety messages. The message should say something like: ""We care about you, your family, our employees and the public. We strive to obey the law and CDC guidelines. If you think we're falling short, please, tell a manager."" That's a business sending the right signal: You should feel good about being here because we're careful. And what responsibility do patrons have? Plenty. If you see something wrong, you should speak up. You're at risk, and so is everyone with whom you'll come in contact. If you're part of the problem — such as by not socially distancing — the business is at fault, but so are you. If you contract Covid-19 in a crowded bar or similar circumstance, you're what's called comparatively negligent for putting yourself in that situation. You knew better than you acted. In the unlikely event a lawyer would take your case, a jury would be asked to compare your negligence to that of the bar. You'd likely be found mostly at fault and in the vast majority of states, you'd collect nothing because most venues bar recovery for plaintiffs whose fault exceeds that of the defendant. How should a business regard their legal responsibility to others beyond their patrons and employees? With concern. Yes, it's true that the patron not socially distanced will have a weak claim. And yes, the employee not socially distanced will be limited to recovery under the worker's compensation system. But the business that permits unsafe practices is subject to successful suit from those who catch the virus from a patron or employee. While it may be hard to prove causation, the possibility of successful suit is real. So even if a campaign rally goer has no claim, his mom might. That's a good reason for everyone to be careful. American tort law has flaws, but usually one who acts unreasonably must pay for the harm they cause. That's a critical principle in a pandemic, where law must serve to deter yet more deaths and compensate victims of others' fault. "
104,White dad with Black kids: George Floyd was my wake-up call,"My wife, Gilda, is Black.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 10:11:55 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/O7hPrRK-qt4/index.html,"Arick Wierson regularly writes for CNN and is a six-time Emmy Award-winning television producer, and former senior media adviser to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He currently advises political and corporate clients in the United States, Africa and Latin America. He and his family live in Excelsior, Minnesota, an area a few miles west of Minneapolis. You can follow him on Twitter @ArickWierson. View more opinion at CNN. My wife, Gilda, is Black. We met years ago when I was working in Angola, her native country in southern Africa. Together, we have two mixed-race children, Haakon and Gabriella, ages 6 and 3. On the evening of May 25, Gilda and I were finishing up a Memorial Day dinner with some friends; we had enjoyed a sunny afternoon boating near Excelsior, a quaint little touristy town on Lake Minnetonka, an affluent area just west of Minneapolis where we live. As we were wrapping up our dinner, we were completely unaware that just a few miles away, a Minneapolis police officer was digging his knee into the neck of an unarmed Black man named George Floyd, ultimately killing him in broad daylight. It wasn't until the next morning that I first saw the video clips of then-Officer Derek Chauvin pinning a handcuffed and defenseless Black man to the ground. As I watched the video detailing the moments during which Floyd was killed, my life changed forever. I am White, educated and consider myself fairly liberal on most social issues, and -- up until recently -- I generally viewed the police as the ""good guys."" Growing up in Excelsior, the totality of my interactions with law enforcement were limited to reruns of shows such as ""Adam-12"" and ""ChiPs"" -- where the cops helped those in need and tracked down bad guys who were truly up to no good, or the occasional ""Officer Appreciation Day"" when a member of the local police department would come to school and talk to students about all the good they do in the community. I was raised to revere and trust law enforcement, and that upbringing, I believe, has framed the mindset of many generations of White Americans like me. Years later, while I was in my 30s, I spent nearly a decade working at City Hall in New York as a senior member of the Bloomberg administration, where I had somewhat regular interactions with top NYPD brass; for the most part, those meetings had always been pleasant and productive, and did nothing if not cement my idea that, generally speaking, cops are people just trying to do the best they can, sometimes in very difficult situations. This is why, even in the face of undeniable video documentation of police brutality against people of color, my default setting to making sense of extraordinary events of racial bias was to assume that there must have been some set of extenuating circumstances that justified the use overwhelming force. Cops and robbers. Police and bad guys. That's the way it has always been for people like me. Of course I was certainly aware that there were long-standing policing issues between African Americans and law enforcement -- the 2016 shooting of Philando Castile was another well-documented case that also happened in my hometown. But even when gross displays of bias happened to my own family on a personal level, as much as it pains me to admit it, it was hard for me to see them for what they were. Since moving with me back to the United States in 2016, my wife had endured a number of -- if not dangerous -- extremely uncomfortable interactions with law enforcement, all of them ultimately stemming from her being a Black woman who drives a nice car in an overwhelmingly White, upper-class community. On each occasion, instead of confronting the systemic issues at play, I chose to chalk up the incident to an individual misunderstanding or somehow justify them in my own head as derivative of other mitigating circumstances. My wife, who has been living in the US for only a few years, has struggled to understand these same incidents through her own cultural filter; in her home country of Angola, police stops are frequent, but not racially motivated; they are generally nothing more than attempted shakedowns for petty cash -- either a small bribe or having a senior member of the police force on your speed dial will generally enable you to go on about your business. There is one particular situation that played out last summer that I have been replaying in my head since the death of George Floyd. My wife and I were on our way out to lunch and I needed to run an errand, so I stopped to go into a store while my wife waited in the car and began talking on the phone. Several minutes later, a passerby had evidently found it suspicious that there was a Black woman sitting alone in the passenger side of a black Mercedes SUV and decided to notify the police. The White officer responding to the call approached the situation as one of pending danger, asking my wife repeatedly whether there were drugs or firearms in the car. When I emerged from the store, and he realized that I -- a White 45-year-old -- was her husband, his demeanor instantly changed, and he apologized for the inconvenience. At the time I thought it was a bizarre situation, but even so, I was reluctant to see it for what it was: extreme bias on both the part of the passerby as well as the responding officer based on the color of my wife's skin. A situation like that should have set off alarms left and right, but my own cultural bias persevered, allowing me to brush off the incident as just small-time Midwestern antics by people who have too much time on their hands. At the time, I was still well within a bubble of denial that prevented me from seeing things not as I wanted to see them, but as they indeed were. What I saw in the video of George Floyd finally ruptured that bubble. The video was clear and audible -- there were no extenuating circumstances that my mind could latch onto to justify the continued use of force once he was handcuffed and on the ground. That this happened only a few miles from where I live was incredibly jarring and certainly contributed to my reaction, but what really connected with me on a visceral level and ultimately shook me was one of the words a dying Floyd cried out in search for mercy: ""Mama."" While I watched the slow-motion killing of Floyd, my thoughts drifted to my son and daughter. With their darker complexion, curly hair and African facial features, society -- and more importantly, law enforcement -- will certainly see them as Black when they are older. What I realized while watching the video of the man foaming at the mouth on the corner of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in South Minneapolis is that Floyd could be either of my children a decade or two from now. As a grown man, helplessly pinned to the ground, likely knowing his life was ending, Floyd cried out for his 'mama.' His mother, who was known as Cissy, had passed away, but in this hour of most dire need, he called out to her -- his protector, his source of unconditional love. That cry pierced the bubble of my own White blindness, awakening me to the reality of what it means to be a parent to Black children. For too many years -- my entire life, in fact -- I had failed to realize that by and large law enforcement has one set of rules for dealing with White citizens and another for people of color. Admittedly, coming to grips with how little I previously understood my wife's reality as a Black person living in this country -- the same reality that awaits my children in a few years -- has been hard; putting those same feelings in writing is perhaps even harder. I've heard quite a few stories in recent days, such as the one recounted by Bryan Monroe in his opinion piece for CNN, of the challenges facing Black parents who have had to impart on their children a special set of instructions for dealing with the police. As a father, your most primal instinct is to protect your kids. You teach them how to behave in public, to be courteous, to not take unnecessary risks and to avoid physical confrontation if at all possible. Here is the big question on my mind now: How do I, as a White father to two Black children, teach them that because their appearance is somewhat different than mine, they will need to abide by a completely different set of rules than I do when interacting with law enforcement? It is both disgusting and enraging. I don't pretend to feel Black America's hurt, but I now feel an intense yet indescribable pain as I think about the world that lies ahead for my children unless society makes tremendous strides in the coming years. I'm also angry and extremely disappointed with myself for never having seen things for what they were before Floyd's death. I understand why so many White Americans are in denial about the racial bias of law enforcement; like me, they probably have never had a single disagreeable interaction with cops beyond the occasional traffic violation. White America was and still is largely brought up to venerate law enforcement. The video of the death of George Floyd was a rude awakening for me. It made me realize that despite all the trappings of privilege that my children have and will continue to enjoy as they grow up -- good schools, lots of travel, a loving and stable home -- being Black will be the singular component of their identity that will most clearly define them not only vis-à-vis law enforcement but in society in general. They will not have the freedom that I as their father have always had -- to always assume that interactions with police will be uneventful. A random traffic stop for me has always been nothing more than a pesky annoyance on the few occasions they have occurred; for my children -- and my wife -- routine stops like these could very well turn into life and death situations. I was pleased to learn that the Minneapolis City Council is poised to dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department; it has long been a hotbed for abuse. What comes in its stead remains to be seen. This much, however, is true: Changing decades of institutionalized police conduct will not be an easy lift. Despite the prodigious multiracial protests that have engulfed major cities around the country and the world, it won't be easy to get vast swaths of White Americans to really understand why the system is broken and why deep reforms are urgently needed. It took the brutal death of George Floyd to crack open the shell that I was living in -- because for once, I saw policing tactics not through the optics of a White man in his 40s, but through eyes of a father to two beautiful Black children and husband of a Black wife. I believe that the uproar over the deaths of George Floyd and, more recently, Rayshard Brooks in Atlanta, as well as other well publicized incidents, show that we as a country still have a long way to go before we can disassemble the relationship between the police -- and how law enforcement is viewed by White America -- and its interaction with people of color. My hope is that these nationwide protests not only shine a light on the issues of policing and race, but ignite and fast-track White America's realization that we as a country still have a long way to go to address systemic racism, racial inequality and a biased criminal justice system in dire need of reform. We have to understand that policymakers won't be able to legislate the end of racism and police departments will struggle to root out bias from within their ranks. Changing society will take time. And it will have to be a group effort. No one man or woman can shoulder this entire movement. We have to realize that we are in this for the long haul, but the death of George Floyd has ensured that, at least for now, White America is beginning to openly talk about the uncomfortable issues of race and bias in this country. And I now see it as my job to help keep that conversation going. My kids are counting on me. "
105,The psychologist in the Trump family speaks,"Born into a fabulously wealthy family of seemingly continuous intrigues, betrayals and conflicts, Mary L. Trump did not seek the spotlight.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Born into a fabulously wealthy family of seemingly continuous intrigues, betrayals and conflicts, Mary L. Trump did not seek the spotlight. She earned a master's in literature at Columbia and a doctorate in psychology at Adelphi University. These disciplines seem to have prepared her to understand and reveal deep truths in a way that would make the family's secret-keepers freak out.  It's safe to assume they are freaking out now. In late July Dr. Trump will publish a book, ominously titled, ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man."" Most readers won't need any more clues about her subject -- her uncle, President Trump. But those who do could consult the cover, which features a photo of a young Trump before he became the figure who now lumbers upon the world stage and lurks in so many nightmares. Three and a half years into the Trump era, endless words have been spent illustrating the chaotic and cruel personality that can, to cite just one example, schedule a huge ego-gratifying rally in the middle of a deadly pandemic caused by a viciously contagious virus. According to her publisher, Mary Trump will bring her special perspective -- insider, psychologist, writer -- to bear on incidents and information never before revealed.  Having devoted years to the study of the man and the Trump clan, I can say that the bits teased so far suggest that Mary Trump has the goods. To begin with, she's the daughter of the President's eldest sibling, Fred Trump Jr., who may have been the original victim of Donald Trump's bullying. As publisher Simon and Schuster put it: ""She recounts in unsparing detail everything from her uncle Donald's place in the family spotlight and Ivana's penchant for regifting to her grandmother's frequent injuries and illnesses and the appalling way Donald, Fred Trump's favorite son, dismissed and derided him when he began to succumb to Alzheimer's."" Warm and easygoing, Fred was, by all accounts, ill-suited to play the role of cutthroat real estate baron, which was what his father expected of him. Happy to step in, Donald did all he could to prove that he was the more deserving son. When Fred Jr. finally ceded first position among the heirs to the family business, he became an airline pilot. Donald mocked his profession. ""What's the difference between what you do,"" he would ask, ""and driving a bus?"" After Fred Jr. died at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, Donald turned his death into an object lesson that reflected well on himself. Donald pointedly abstained from tobacco and alcohol because of his brother's struggle, saying, ""I watched him. And I learned from him."" The cruelty didn't stop with Fred Jr.'s death in 1981. Later, when the paterfamilias Fred Trump Sr. died, heirs learned that his will distributed his estate among his children and their offspring ""other than my son Fred C. Trump Jr."" The children of Fred Jr. sued, noting that an earlier will, written prior to Fred Sr. being diagnosed with dementia, had granted them proper shares. Soon after the suit was filed, Donald changed a health insurance policy, taking away coverage for a disabled infant born to Fred's own son, Fred III.  (A second telling anecdote from author Harry Hurt III, who has written about the Trumps, describes Donald briefly considering evicting his brother and sisters from their rent-free homes in a Trump building unless they paid cash for the property.) When asked in 2000 whether withdrawing the child's insurance was cold-hearted, the man who claimed to be a billionaire said, ""I can't help that. It's cold when someone sues my father."" The suit was settled and the baby was again insured, but 16 years later, when he was running for president, Donald Trump seemingly had no regrets. Asked about the incident, he said, ""I was angry because they sued."" For those who know the family lore, the circle is completed by a little anecdote published in Hurt's 1993 book ""Lost Tycoon."" Hurt reports overhearing Fred Trump Sr. talking about his son Donald and his wife Mary flying off together. ""I hope their plane crashes,"" said Fred, adding that then ""all my problems will be solved."" Reports on the upcoming book suggest that the author will share juicy stories she learned from the President's sister, Maryanne Barry. It wouldn't be the first time that Barry, perhaps inadvertently, revealed something true about her brother. Speaking with writer Gwenda Blair in 1990, Barry shared a story about when Donald was a young man and turned a game of catch with Barry's seven year-old son into a cruel contest. ""Donald kept throwing it faster and faster, harder and harder, until I hear this crack and the ball hit David's head. Donald had to beat the seven year-old."" This cold-hearted nature followed him into his political career. As president, Donald Trump has treated the children of asylum-seeking immigrants with great cruelty, separating them from their parents and locking them in cages. During our current pandemic, with over 116,000 dead in the US and more succumbing every hour, he has been so cavalier as to advocate dangerous unproven cures.   In my own experience as a Trump biographer I have answered questions about the origins of the President's weird ways by citing both genetics and his upbringing. This nature-and-nurture answer is a bit of a cop-out, but it is the best I have been able to muster after studying the man and his family. Because she has lived close to the source and possesses real expertise in mental health, Mary Trump's opinion matters greatly to those seeking answers. I can't wait to read her book. "

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers' questions on ""CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera"" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays. John Bolton has offered the nation a staggering profile in cowardice. He has left no doubt about his own monumental betrayal of his country. By his own belated admission, Bolton directly witnessed not one but multiple acts that could have been cited in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. But Bolton did nothing about it while he held a powerful post in the Trump administration. And he stayed quiet and took cover when Congress and the nation pleaded with him to speak out during the impeachment process. Yet now that he has entered book promo mode, Bolton suddenly has summoned the spine that he was sorely missing back when it would have made an actual difference. Bolton had ample opportunity to speak up throughout the monthslong impeachment of Trump over the Ukraine scandal. House investigators first asked that he appear to give voluntary testimony; Bolton was a no-show. Bolton then retained counsel, who requested a subpoena and promised to go to the courts for adjudication. Investigators decided not to issue a subpoena and spend months bogged down in court. Bolton later claimed he would testify in the Senate, if subpoenaed. But Senate Republicans — quite likely fearful of what Bolton might say — voted not to hear any witnesses at all. Let's be clear: Throughout the legal and political machinations, Bolton remained entirely free to speak out publicly. But he decided to remain quiet — until now. And his testimony, it turns out, would have gone right to the heart of the matter. According to the New York Times, Bolton now belatedly reveals in his book that Trump explicitly conditioned foreign aid to Ukraine on investigations of his political opponents. Trump's defenders repeatedly claimed there was no ""firsthand evidence"" of a quid pro quo. Bolton's testimony would have established just that. Worse, Bolton now tells the world that he witnessed (and apparently decided to do nothing about) not just one impeachable act, but several. Showing a remarkable lack of self-awareness, he criticizes House investigators for committing ""impeachment malpractice"" by failing to discover these critical facts. But how, exactly, should investigators have discovered this information when the key witness — Bolton himself — played games and refused to talk? Even more troubling, Bolton now details Trump's active solicitation of election assistance from Chinese President Xi Jinping. Bolton proclaims that ""I saw these developments as a threat to U.S. strategic interests and to our friends and allies."" Bolton now writes that Trump engaged in ""a pattern of fundamentally unacceptable behavior that eroded the very legitimacy of the presidency. "" Yet Bolton did nothing and said nothing until now, as he tries to goose his book sales. Bolton proclaims that Trump engaged in behavior that ""looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn't accept."" But apparently, Bolton was absolutely fine with accepting it. He saw this pattern of obstruction of justice as it happened, and he curled up in a ball until the dust settled and his book hit the shelves. Bolton could have changed the course of history. Instead, he will go down in a footnote as an enabler of corruption, a model of cowardice and an opportunist who put self above country. "
107,The remarkable idiocy of holding a Trump rally in Tulsa,"Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 20:31:12 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/wqB7kc920_M/index.html,"Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Like many others, I was startled to learn that President Donald Trump was resuming his campaign barnstorming in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Startled that he was hitting the road again in the middle of a pandemic, startled that he had picked the place where a massacre of African Americans occurred (and was covered up) 99 years ago, startled that he initially decided to do this on Juneteenth -- June 19, the holiday celebrating the end of slavery. And then I was startled that he backed down and delayed the rally by a day. I will let others examine Trump's cruelty in stoking racial divisiveness at such a historical flashpoint. Let others comment on his flippant disregard of public health experts as he ridicules mask wearers as unmanly of PC for caring about keeping themselves and others safe from Covid-19. Instead, I will focus on the remarkable idiocy of staging a large indoor public gathering in Tulsa just now. Tulsa may not be the single worst place in the US to have a mask-free and liability-free rally, though the just identified Whirlpool plant outbreak there may place it in the running. Indeed, cases are going up sharply in Tulsa County (from 7-day rolling average of 13.6 cases to 53.37 cases for most recent two weeks) signaling substantial community transmission. The disease appears disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics who constitute 13% of the population but 27% of the Covid-19 cases. Furthermore, Tulsa is near the border of several states; Trump's rally is likely to draw from these areas as well. Over in Arkansas, four counties at the Oklahoma border -- Benton, Washington (home of Fayetteville), Crawford, and Sebastian (home of Fort Smith) -- have experienced sharply increasing case rates in the last two weeks. This is likely due to the concentration of meatpacking plants in the area, Nationally, these areas have been connected to Covid-19 transmission due to the tight quarters in processing lines and other areas in busy plants. Tyson Foods, the second largest meatpacking company in the US, is headquartered in Springdale, Arkansas, which straddles Benton and Washington Counties. It is a mere 100 miles from Tulsa. Tulsa also is a few hours down the road from the southwest corner of Missouri. Jasper (home of Joplin), McDonald and Newton Counties each have gone from almost no cases two weeks ago to more than five cases daily per county -- in Jasper's case, nearly 10 (again, rolling 7-day average). This has led local authorities to reinstitute some precautions. The source of the increase is not known, though adjacent Barry County features a chicken meatpacking plant that has seen its first two cases. As we have witnessed repeatedly, today's two cases may presage tomorrow's frantic headline. So, from a strict public health perspective, the selection of Tulsa is a terrible decision. So why the choice? Yes, Tulsa is an extremely conservative city with wonderful cheeseburgers and a deluxe golf course, as well as a city where he has found enthusiastic support at past rallies, but this is true of many cities in the South. Is the choice really just another manifestation of Brutalist politics? As a native Oklahoman, I have a theory: Oral Roberts. Oral Roberts and the hazy world of faith healing. I know this topic quite well. As a kid, on Sunday mornings, my brothers and I used to watch Oral Roberts on television. Our Hebrew Sunday School started at 10 a.m., so we killed time in the early hours watching the faith healing shows till it was time to go listen to the rabbi. Importantly, this was before Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker and the other preachers with high production values crowded out the field. The Oral Roberts shows then were grainy and uncertain with a jittery camera and fluctuating sound that made them strangely sincere. Watching, my brothers and I felt confusion and awe, wondering if they were kidding or if they were actors or if they were insane or if they maybe were being cured -- I mean it seemed so convincing in its own way. Rows of people looking up, believing and eager and happy despite (or because of) the scene's basic lack of credibility. They shrieked and clapped as Oral Roberts' touch and prayer healed person after person. Which brings us to now and the Trump rallies. For me, the most unsettling feature as he gloats and preens his hour upon the stage is the hypnotic connection between him and his crowd. Because these are the very faces I saw on my Sunday morning TV -- those of people who are witnessing an incredible miracle. Tulsa therefore is the perfect place for the President to resume his campaign. Not only does he get a groveling crowd and a chance to cruelly wink at the city's racist past but because he is guaranteed something he can't find any place else: an arena full of people raised on the exhilarating lunacy of a giant tent revival.

108,Brazil may surpass the US to become the worst-hit country on the planet,"Brazil has now reported more than 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus and 48,954 deaths, marking a grim milestone for the South American country.","Fri, 19 Jun 2020 22:24:49 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/TqaduNqZ1VU/index.html,"Brazil has now reported more than 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus and 48,954 deaths, marking a grim milestone for the South American country. The health ministry on Friday reported 54,771 new cases, a record daily spike that brought the nationwide total to 1,032,913. The Covid-19 pandemic is quickly spreading with no sign of slowing down, as major cities lift social distancing measures and begin reopening restaurants, shops and other nonessential businesses. Many experts believe the number of cases could surpass the United States and that Brazil may soon become the country worst hit by the virus. Despite this, President Jair Bolsonaro continues to downplay the threat by questioning global medical authorities and accusing opponents of trying to discredit his leadership. Bolsonaro's false sense of immunity At first, Brazil seemed impervious to the virus as it spread through countries such as China, Italy and the United States. Bolsonaro only grudgingly agreed to repatriate Brazilian citizens from the then-epicenter, Hubei province, reportedly worrying that they would put the rest of the country at risk. The first case was confirmed on February 26, when it was believed to be an isolated case of a man who flew back from Italy to Sao Paulo with the virus. A month later, coronavirus cases in Brazil had already risen to close to 3,000 and the death toll was at 77. It was around this time when Bolsonaro first compared the virus to a ""little flu"" and falsely implied that Brazilians were immune to the virus. ""Brazilians don't catch anything ... they already have the antibodies to keep it from spreading,"" the President said. He said again that Brazilians are likely to be immune to the coronavirus during a March 26 press conference outside the Alvorada presidential residence in Brasilia. ""Brazilians should be studied, we don't catch anything. You see people jumping in sewage, diving in it and nothing happens to them,"" Bolsonaro said. During the same press conference, Bolsonaro said he believed many Brazilians had already been infected but that those people already had ""the antibodies that would help [coronavirus] not spread."" Bolsonaro vs. Social Distancing Cases began to quickly spread across the country and it became clear that Brazil would soon become a new hot spot for the virus. By April 8, Brazil had confirmed more than 15,000 cases and 800 deaths. Despite warnings from health experts, images of Bolsonaro hugging supporters at a local bakery in Brasilia and posing without a mask emerged the following day. Bolsonaro believed the social distancing and quarantine measures imposed by officials in major cities, such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, would cause more harm than the virus itself and lead Brazil to a crippling recession. ""The issue of unemployment, the issue of the economy no longer working. We can't let the side-effect of the fight against the virus be more harmful than the disease itself,"" Bolsonaro said. Bolsonaro frequently butted heads with mayors and governors of some of the hardest hit places by Covid-19 and ultimately fired Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta on April 16 after he expressed his support for shutting down businesses and schools. The following weekend, Bolsonaro attended an anti-lockdown rally in Brasilia without a mask where he coughed several times and shook hands with supporters. Opposition leaders considered the protests ""anti-democratic,"" after signs were seen calling for dissolving the Congress and Supreme Court and for the return of the dictatorship. Military in the Health Ministry Health Minister Mandetta's successor, Nelson Teich, lasted less than a month in office before resigning. One of his major disagreements with Bolsonaro was over authorizing the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. Eduardo Pazuello, an army general with no health experience, was named as the interim Health Minister following Teich's resignation. A few days after he assumed the role, he began replacing key positions within the ministry with other military brass. At least nine people were named within the first few weeks that he took office, to positions within the ministry dealing with planning, budget and public health issues. Pazuello also issued new guidance authorizing the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, for all patients displaying Covid-19 symptoms. ""After two Health Ministers refused to do so and chose to resign instead of signing the document, it was up to General Eduardo Pazuello, who has assumed the ministry on an interim basis, to authorize the use of chloroquine for all Covid-19 patients,"" Pazuello wrote on his personal Twitter account last month. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked permissions this week for the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19 patients. That same day, Brazil's Health Ministry expanded its guidance on the use of the drugs to include pregnant women and children. The Health Ministry said the studies referenced by the FDA cannot be used as an example for the rest of the world because the ""quality of the methodology is terrible"" and claimed cases of Covid-19 were going down in areas where the drugs were being used, without presenting any proof. The recommendation to use the drugs to treat children came despite guidance from the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics, saying there isn't enough data to prove the drugs' effectiveness in minors and that it should only be prescribed during clinical trials and with parental consent. The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday that it is still reviewing the use of hydroxychloroquine in its Solidarity Trial, a multi-country clinical study of Covid-19 treatment options. The organization had temporarily paused the trial in May due to concerns surrounding the drug's safety and in order to review its own data but resumed the program earlier this month. Bolsonaro threatens to withdraw from WHO Earlier this month, WHO called on nations to encourage the public to wear fabric masks in public. ""WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a media briefing on June 5. WHO's updated guidance recommends masks be used as part of a ""comprehensive package"" to help curb the spread of Covid-19, which includes physical distancing, frequent hand washing, people who are sick self-isolating at home, suspected cases getting tested, and their contacts being traced. Bolsonaro accused threatened to pull Brazil from the WHO that same evening and accused the organization of ""ideological bias."" ""The United States left the WHO. We are considering that that also. Either the organization works without ideological bias, or we leave it too,"" Bolsonaro told reporters. ""We don't need foreign people having a say in our health here."" Bolsonaro doubled-down on his attacks on the organization recently, after he accused it of trying to drive Brazil towards an economic recession. ""The so-called World Health Organization, wants us to follow them blindly. First, they say that asymptomatic people cannot transmit the virus then they go back on their comment. It seems like there is something more serious behind all that, they want our countries to go broke,"" Bolsonaro said during a press conference outside the Alvorada residence last Wednesday, referencing a WHO admission that asymptomatic transmission was a ""major unknown."" ""The amount of economic problems this is going to cause will be huge, to the point of leaving Brazil broke,"" he said, repeating his oft-mentioned worry that the economic impact of the virus will be worse than the death toll. Triage vs. shutdown Instead of enforcing social distancing measures, his health minister General Pazuello has advocated for setting up more health triage centers across the country. There is no such thing as ""100% isolation,"" he recently told CNN Brasil. Cities across Brazil began gradually reopening last week. In major metropolitan areas, like Sao Paulo, malls and outdoor bazaars reopened for the first time in three months. Large crowds and traffic were reported in the bustling city center over the weekend by local media outlets. Officials insist the decision is based on improving conditions, like increasing availability of intensive care beds and a flattening infection curve in some places. But experts say the conditions to reopen are far from ideal and worry the rush could lead to more transmissions and postpone a real recovery. ""You need to tackle the transportation issue. If everyone continues to take crowded buses and metro, which is what is happening, it won't work,"" said Paulo Lotufo, an epidemiologist at the University of São Paulo. Shortly after Sao Paulo began reopening, Mayor Bruno Covas was diagnosed with coronavirus last Saturday. Covas, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment for lymphoma, displayed no symptoms, according to a statement from the mayor's office. The statement also said Covas will be working from home and remain under observation. Invading hospitals and Covid-19 wars Recent studies conducted by the non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies found that the country could run out of health professionals and intensive care unit (ICU) beds soon. More than 60% of Brazil's population depends on the country's public health care system and at least 10% of Brazilians live in areas where there are no ICU beds available, according to the Institute. ""The response to the pandemic could not have been any worse,"" Miguel Lago, a lecturer at Columbia University and executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, told CNN. ""This was not Sierra Leone before the Ebola crisis, Brazil had a solid public health care system that could have been put to better use at the beginning of the pandemic."" A CNN team recently visited hospitals in the cities of Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Manaus where health professionals shared horror stories of overcrowded ICU units and doctors and nurses treating patients at high risk of exposure and death. ""It's not a flu. It's the worst thing we have ever faced in our professional lives,"" Dr. Jacques Sztajnbok from Sao Paulo's Emilio Ribas Infectious Disease Institute told CNN. Yet, Bolsonaro continues to question the claims that more is needed and that ICUs and hospitals are overcrowded, recently encouraging his supporters to go into the facilities to gather some video proof. ""There are field hospitals and public hospitals near you, find a way to get in and film in there,"" Bolsonaro said last Thursday during a Facebook live event. ""We need more people to go in there and show if these beds are actually full. That helps us and all that material gathered from social media will then be sent to the Federal Police."" Several instances of pro-Bolsonaro lawmakers and supporters trying to gain access to coronavirus treatment wards have recently been registered in the states of Sao Paulo, Espirito Santo and the Federal District, where the capital Brasilia is located. ""This type of behavior is unacceptable at a time when the state of Espirito Santo, the country and the world face this serious crisis,"" the state health secretariat said in a written statement. ""What's worse is that this behavior was encouraged by an irresponsible statement from the leader of this nation."" Brazil's Attorney General Augusto Aras said he will call on state prosecutors offices to investigate the incidents, including claims of medical professionals being threatened and assaulted, according to a statement released by his office Monday. ""This behavior endangers the physical integrity of the brave professionals who dedicate themselves to reversing a health crisis unprecedented in the country's history,"" Aras said in the press release. Brazil inches towards highest virus death toll Brazil could overtake the US and become the country with the highest number of coronavirus deaths as early as August 1, according to a tracking model by the University of Washington. The model also predicts deaths will more than double to 100,000 in less than a month. ""I think we will pass the United States I think we will be the major victim of Covid-19 and this is directly linked to the fact that we don't have a national plan,"" Lago told CNN. Brazil's cases have been increasing by roughly 30,000 cases a day and deaths around 1,200 per day. Earlier this month, an official Covid-19 tracker from the Brazilian Health Ministry began showing only data on new cases and deaths recorded in the past 24 hours, eliminating running cumulative totals of virus deaths and cases that had previously appeared on the same page. Bolsonaro tweeted at the time that ""cumulative data, in addition to not showing that the large part [of patients] no longer has the illness, does not depict the moment of the country. Other actions are in the works to improve case notifications and diagnostic confirmations."" The move led to immediate backlash over lack of transparency. The Supreme Court later ruled the ministry must provide comprehensive data. During a recent interview with CNN affiliate CNN Brasil, Pazuello said the Health Ministry had taken down the numbers because it was changing the way Brazil tallied its coronavirus data. ""The first thing we need to understand is that whatever methodology we use to tally the cases will not alter the number of obits,"" Pazuello said. ""There is no way to manipulate the data, because they are all registered. It would be absurd for us in the Health Ministry to have registered data and to then say it doesn't exist."" Brazil's previous health ministers predicted the height of the pandemic would be May through July. Under the current leadership, there is no sense of when the peak will be or when it will plateau. Several tests and vaccine trials are being conducted in Brazil. Two thousand Brazilians participated in tests of a vaccine against Covid-19 this month developed by Oxford University in partnership with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical, the Federal University of Sao Paulo (Unifesp) said in a statement. The country is the first site of these vaccination tests outside the United Kingdom. The Brazilian Butantan Institute, one of the country's top biomedical research centers, announced an agreement with Chinese laboratory Sinovac Biotech to conduct Phase III of a clinical coronavirus vaccine trial on approximately 9,000 volunteers in Brazil in the first week of July. The vaccine went through the first two phases of testing in China, where it was tested on 744 volunteers. The Chinese lab started human clinical trials with the experimental vaccine on April 17. However, the real test will be whether or not Bolsonaro is able lead Brazil out of this crisis as he faces a pandemic, crippling recession, political upheaval and a probe into allegations he interfered with police investigations. Back in April, when Brazil's death toll reached 5,000,  Bolsonaro's answer to the pandemic was a simple one. ""So what? I'm sorry, but what do you want me to do?"" Bolsonaro said on April 29, outside the presidential residence in Brasilia. ""I'm sorry for the situation we are currently living with due to the virus. We express our solidarity to those who have lost loved ones, many of whom were elderly. But that's life, it could be me tomorrow."" "

The two men, from Switzerland and Brazil, were rescued on Thursday after being held in a house by the rebel group in the southwestern town of Corinto, according to a statement published on the military's website. In the statement, the military said retired Swiss citizen Daniel Max Guggenheim and Brazilian citizen José Iban Alburqueque García had been ""returned to freedom"" as a result of the rescue operation. Guggenheim and Alburqueque García were both kidnapped on March 16 by members of the FARC's former sixth front, known as the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, along with their small dogs, Preto and Fifi. FARC was created in 1964 after the success of the Cuban revolution inspired rebels to attempt to forcibly redistribute wealth across the country. Following a peace deal in 2016, the organization agreed to lay down arms in a bid to pursue influence via politics, rather than violence. However, a number of dissident factions continue to operate in the country. Soldiers from Colombia's Rapid Deployment Force No. 4 found the kidnapped men and their dogs in a house where, the military said, they would have been transferred to after being kidnapped. The operation involved the Investigative Technical Corps of the Colombian Prosecutor's Office and Colombian soldiers captured a member of the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column during the rescue, the military said. Speaking after his rescue, Swiss national Guggenheim, who owns Fifi, a 13-year-old Pomeranian, said: ""The kidnappers treated us well. The pets were long overdue for food but they finally bought dry food in the village."" The dogs, he said, hadn't suffered like their owners as ""they have been able to get out"" and ""enjoy the wild mountain of this region."" CNN's Rachel Clarke contributed to this report."
110,Bank of England joins British companies in apologizing for slavery,The Bank of England has become the latest British institution to apologize for historic ties to slavery.,"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:18:43 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/RSBse-ywxVQ/index.html,"London The Bank of England has become the latest British institution to apologize for historic ties to slavery. Several UK companies acknowledged ties to the slave trade this week and pledged new financial support to black and minority ethnic communities. The companies are highlighted in a University College London database exploring the legacies of British slave ownership, which made a considerable contribution to the country's wealth. Britain enslaved 3.1 million Africans between 1640 and 1807, transporting them to colonies around the world, according to Historic England, a public body. Many of these individuals were taken to the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations, which made their owners very wealthy through the export of sugar, molasses and rum, according to the National Archives. When colonial slavery was abolished in 1833, the British government paid £20 million ($25 million) to compensate slave owners, while the enslaved received nothing. In today's terms that compensation equates to around £16.5 billion ($20.6 billion), according to Historic England. In recent weeks, Black Lives Matter protests have erupted across the United Kingdom, with demonstrators tearing down a statue of seventeenth century slave trader Edward Colston and calling for the removal of other monuments. ""The slave-owners were one very important means by which the fruits of slavery were transmitted to metropolitan Britain,"" University College London says. The university's database shows that several former governors and directors of the Bank of England owned slaves. These individuals were compensated by the UK government when slavery was abolished, receiving several thousand pounds in some cases to free their slaves. A spokesperson for the Bank of England said in a statement Friday that the eighteenth and nineteenth century slave trade was an ""unacceptable"" part of English history and apologized for the role played by former governors and directors. The central bank will take down images of former governors and directors who were involved in the slave trade if they are on display anywhere in the Bank, the spokesperson said. Churches and cathedrals are also considering how they can address the issues raised by Black Lives Matter when it comes to monuments, the Church of England's director of cathedrals and church buildings, Becky Clark, said in a statement. This may include the alteration of removal of monuments, but this must be done ""safely and legally,"" she added. ""Slavery and exploitation have no place in society,"" said a spokesperson for the Church of England. ""While we recognise the leading role clergy and active members of the Church of England played in securing the abolition of slavery, it is a source of shame that others within the Church actively perpetrated slavery and profited from it,"" the spokesperson added. The Church of England issued an apology in 2006, acknowledging the part it played in historic cases of slavery. It now works to end modern day slavery through the Clewer Initiative. Major companies around the world are grappling with how to address racial injustice. British companies Lloyd's of London, the world's oldest insurance market, and pub chain Greene King acknowledged their ties to the slave trade earlier this week. This year more than a dozen US firms, including Nike (NKE), Twitter (TWTR) and Target (TGT), have given employees a day off work to observe June 19, or Juneteenth, as a paid holiday. Juneteenth marks the day in 1865 when, more than two years after the Emancipation Proclamation, slavery was ended in Texas. — Clare Duffy contributed reporting. "
111,Analysis: Putin rewrites World War II history -- and does battle over historical memory,"William Faulkner's famous line, ""the past is never dead. It's not even past,"" is back in vogue. It's not just about debate in the US about removing Confederate statues, or in the UK over monuments to imperialists -- the war over World War II is back in play, too.","Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:43:14 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/g-Ny4xh_644/index.html,"William Faulkner's famous line, ""the past is never dead. It's not even past,"" is back in vogue. It's not just about debate in the US about removing Confederate statues, or in the UK over monuments to imperialists -- the war over World War II is back in play, too. On Thursday, the US magazine National Interest published an essay by Russian President Vladimir Putin, about the legacy of the war in Europe that ended just over 75 years ago. Putin begins the essay with a personal note: Like millions of citizens of the former Soviet Union, his family's life was touched directly by the war. ""For my parents, the war meant the terrible ordeals of the Siege of Leningrad where my two-year-old brother Vitya died,"" he writes. ""It was the place where my mother miraculously managed to survive. My father, despite being exempt from active duty, volunteered to defend his hometown. He made the same decision as millions of Soviet citizens. He fought at the Nevsky Pyatachok bridgehead and was severely wounded."" But Putin's reading of wartime history has a very deliberate message for today. First, there's the timing. Putin had originally planned a major celebration to mark Victory Day on May 9, the day that Russia observes the end of the Second World War in Europe, inviting world leaders to join him for an extravagant parade in Red Square. Victory Day was meant to signal that Russia had reclaimed its place as a historic liberator, after years of harsh sanctions that followed the country's annexation of Crimea in 2014. It also would have followed a carefully scripted domestic political moment for the Kremlin: a national vote on constitutional amendments that would have paved the way for Putin to stay in power until 2036. The coronavirus pandemic put paid those plans. The Kremlin rescheduled the parade, after World War II veterans raised concerns about the health risks of holding an event that would draw massive crowds in Moscow and other cities. The parade is now slated to go ahead next week. Cynics might say that surviving veterans of World War II -- who hold a position of great veneration in Russian society -- provided convenient cover to the Kremlin. But the historical ruminations of Putin point to a larger campaign by Russia to reclaim some moral high ground -- and to justify its recent foreign policy. For starters, there's Putin's description of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact of 1939, a nonaggression pact between Adolf Hitler's Germany and Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union. A secret annex in the treaty paved the way for a carve-up of Poland, which the Soviet Union invaded from the east just a few weeks after Nazi Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, and the occupation of the Baltic states in 1940. The existence of the secret protocol is not in dispute. But in his essay, Putin cast the treaty as a necessary defensive measure, a moral equivalent to the 1938 Munich Agreement between the UK, Germany, France and Italy that ceded Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland to Hitler's Germany. The agreement is now seen as a classic appeasement of an unrelenting expansionist power. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain famously described the Munich Agreement -- which Putin refers to as the ""Munich Betrayal"" -- as ""peace for our time."" But the agreement failed, and Putin argues that Stalin was left with no other option than to strike its own deal with Germany. ""In these circumstances, the Soviet Union signed the Non-Aggression Pact with Germany,"" he writes. ""It was practically the last among the European countries to do so."" That doesn't mean Putin whitewashes the legacy of Stalin, whose mass arrests and purges claimed the lives of millions of Soviet citizens. ""Stalin and his entourage, indeed, deserve many legitimate accusations,"" Putin writes. ""We remember the crimes committed by the regime against its own people and the horror of mass repressions."" However, he says, the pact was strategically appropriate. ""In other words, there are many things the Soviet leaders can be reproached for, but poor understanding of the nature of external threats is not one of them. They saw how attempts were made to leave the Soviet Union alone to deal with Germany and its allies. Bearing in mind this real threat, they sought to buy precious time needed to strengthen the country's defenses."" His reading of history is likely to spark outrage in Poland and the Baltic states, which are now members of the European Union as well as members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. For all of those countries, Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its backing of separatists set a worrisome precedent: If Russia was willing to ""intervene"" on behalf of ethnic Russians in Crimea by sending its troops, would it do the same in the Baltics? Hitler scrapped his pact with Stalin in 1941, invading Poland and launching a war that cost the Soviet Union more than 25 million military and civilian lives. Western popular culture has at times overlooked that sacrifice, focusing on events such as the Normandy landings in 1944. But Putin's essay elevates the Soviet war in Europe to something higher: A crusade to save the world. And in doing so, he suggests that the darker wartime chapters are above criticism -- and by extension, so is Putin's Russia today. "

Jones attended Southern Baptist churches, Sunday schools, even a Southern Baptist college. But it was only in seminary, in his mid-20s, that Jones says he learned the full truth about Southern Baptists' white supremacist roots. The denomination was founded to defend slavery and did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to apologize for their history of racism. Jones was a social scientist before he realized how stubbornly racist ideas can persist in White churches. ""White Christian churches have not just been complacent; they have not only been complicit,"" he writes in his book, ""White Too Long: The Legacy of White Supremacy in American Christianity,"" publishing next month. ""Rather, as the dominant cultural power in America, they have been responsible for constructing and sustaining a project to protect White supremacy and resist Black equality,"" he writes. ""This project has framed the entire American story."" In the book Jones, CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute, blends church history, memoir and contemporary public opinion surveys. Together, they make a clear and compelling case for why White American Christians need to reckon with their past. But American Christianity's past is only part of the problem. In survey after survey, said Jones, contemporary white Christians repeatedly deny that structural racism is a problem, that shootings of unarmed Blacks are not isolated incidents, or even that African Americans still face racism and discrimination. White non-Christians, on the other hand, more often agree with Blacks about racial discrimination, according to public opinion surveys. So what gives? Why would White Christians be more reluctant to see racism than their non-Christian counterparts? If that's the question that animates ""White Too Long,"" the answer will be challenging, if not deeply unsettling for many White Christians. CNN spoke to Jones recently about why so many White Christians turn a blind eye to racism, how white supremacy took hold of American culture and what Christians can do now to make amends. What prompted you to write this book? Whenever we asked questions about race or African Americans there was a huge gap between Whites who are Christian and those who are not. Whites who are not Christian were always closer to the attitudes of African Americans. Seeing that pattern over and over made me realize that something deeper is going on. And coupled with my own experience of growing up in the South and this current moment, I realized that these issues are not being dealt with well. Most White Christians try to ignore them. To that point, it seems like more White evangelicals than we've seen in the past are speaking out against the recent killings of Black Americans by the police and vigilantes. Joel Osteen, who is often studiously apolitical, marched in a Black Lives Matter protest. Some evangelicals are even mentioning systemic racism, which they've been slow to acknowledge in the past. What do you make of their responses? One measure of authenticity for White Christians is whether they link reconciliation with justice and repair. It's easy for a White Christain leader to jump in a march and put his arm around an African-American pastor. But will we see Joel Osteen preach a sermon calling for White Christians to reflect on the ugly parts of our history? Are pastors going to help White Christians free their faith from privileged claims of whiteness? One of the challenges, historically, has been that the Christian theology developed in White churches intentionally blinds White Christians to racial injustice. White Christians are nearly twice as likely as non-religious Americans to say police shootings of unarmed black men are isolated incidents. That is a moral and theological problem. We've heard some Christian leaders denounce racism in clear moral terms, but that doesn't seem to filter down to the pews, according to surveys. And that's a problem not only for White evangelicals but Catholics and others, right? Yes, that's true not only for evangelicals but Catholics and the more liberal mainline Protestant leaders. They've put out a number of statements and press releases, but historically they have not landed at the parish or congregational level. And that's where theology gets built: at the local level. The hymns sung, the scripture passages preached, how people understand salvation, none of that has been deconstructed. It was all built for a world in which White Christians needed to shield their institutions and beliefs from claims of injustice by African Americans. You can see that in the way Black Catholics were forced to sit in the back of the church and receive Communion last, and in the way the Southern and Northern branches of Methodism realigned after the Civil War but still didn't admit Black churches as equal members. Why have so many White Christians been so slow to recognize the racism in their past, as well as the racism that continues in America? As long as White supremacy has a hold on our culture, it's pretty comfortable for White Christian churches to say their theology is about personal salvation and personal lives. Theology has been constricted to be only about personal piety, disconnected from claims of social justice. Everything outside of salvation has been labeled ""politics."" It's a self-protective move. If you read sermons in Mississippi in the 1950s and 1960s you would have no idea that there was a Civil Rights movement. It was a lulling of white consciences to sleep. But what about now, this moment? I see the last four years as a moment of reckoning for White Christians. The election of President Trump, who has put White supremacy front and center, has brought these issues from just barely below the surface into plain view. Charlottesville changed things. Charleston changed things. Dylan Roof was a confirmed Lutheran, who, in his journal while imprisoned has been drawing crosses and white Jesus and is completely unrepentant. White Christians have inherited a worldview that has Christians on top of other religions, men over women, Whites over Blacks. There is a top-down authoritarian structure to it. What, if anything, can change that? In the book, I write about two Baptist churches in Macon, Georgia, one White and one Black, who have built trust and a partnership in a way that allowed White Christians to be challenged about their assumptions. White Christians don't have the critical distance to do that for themselves. They have to put themselves in community with African American Christians. And frankly, even with that, it's going to be a long journey. "
113,Boy survives shark attack in North Carolina,A 16-year-old boy visiting North Carolina's Outer Banks with his family is recovering from injuries suffered when he was attacked by a shark on Thursday.,"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 01:56:17 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/VXoz_HdjA50/index.html,"A 16-year-old boy visiting North Carolina's Outer Banks with his family is recovering from injuries suffered when he was attacked by a shark on Thursday. Nick Arthur was jumping over waves on a sandbar about 25 feet offshore when he started screaming, his father told CNN. ""At first I thought he was screaming out of joy, and then I looked at him and saw the shark,"" Tim Arthur said. The shark had its teeth around Nick's thigh and was not letting go, Arthur said. ""He was screaming 'Get it off me. Let me go' and I jumped into action,"" Arthur said. Arthur said his daughter swam to shore while he and his son fought the shark. Arthur said he kicked the shark near its nose while Nick was hitting him with his hand. The shark let go of Nick's thigh as it tried to nip at his hand, allowing Nick to swim free. The attack occurred in the ocean near Vehicle Ramp 25, about 2½ miles south of the village of Salvo, according to the National Park Service. The Arthur family were visiting Cape Hatteras National Seashore from their home in Oak Ridge, North Carolina, near Winston-Salem. Nick was taken to a hospital in nearby Nags Head where he was treated for his injuries, according to the National Park Service. He ended up with roughly 40 teeth prints on his thigh and received 17 stitches, his father said. He had to get stitches on his thumb and has teeth scrapes on his hand. Though bruised and sore, Arthur said his son is good spirits and luckily, there seems to be no permanent damage. He said the incident hasn't soured the family on swimming at the beach, but added they probably won't go out as far in the future. ""You always think it's not going to be you,"" Arthur said. "
114,NASA's Perseverance rover will launch to Mars next month with a global tribute to health care workers,"After a decade in the making, NASA is one month out from launching the Perseverance rover to Mars. This rover, launching during a pandemic, will carry a tribute to health care workers from around the world.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 06:01:07 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/WSjnQC5FHZA/index.html,"A mission 10 years in the making, NASA is one month out from launching the Perseverance rover to Mars. This rover, launching during a pandemic, will carry a tribute to health care workers around the world. The 3-by-5-inch aluminum plate, installed on the left side of the rover chassis, shows Earth supported by the ancient symbol of the serpent entwined around a rod to represent the global medical community. A line represents the rover's trajectory from Central Florida to Mars, according to NASA. ""We wanted to demonstrate our appreciation for those who have put their personal well-being on the line for the good of others,"" said Matt Wallace, Perseverance deputy project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, in a statement. ""It is our hope that when future generations travel to Mars and happen upon our rover, they will be reminded that back on Earth in the year 2020 there were such people."" When Alexander Mather, a seventh grade student in Virginia, entered his submission in a nationwide contest last year to name the rover, a pandemic wasn't on the horizon. But his winning entry for Perseverance has proven to be the perfect name for a rover launching during unprecedented times. These last few months of preparing the rover for launch have happened during the constraints of safe operation during a pandemic. But the teams rose to the challenge, and the launch remains on schedule. ""The team never wavered in its pursuit of the launch pad,"" said Michael Watkins, director of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in a statement. ""It was through their dedication and the help of other NASA facilities that we have made it this far."" The launch window opens on July 20 and extends until August 11, in case bad weather or other issues prevent the 9:15 a.m. ET launch on July 20. That date has been projected since the rover was announced in December 2012. But launching during this window is critical during a time when Mars and Earth are on the same side of the sun, otherwise the spacecraft could be delayed from launching for two years until September 22. The delay would cost the agency $500 million and impact the long-term goals of NASA's Mars Exploration Program, according to NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. ""I hope people watch this mission and that they're inspired that we can strive and achieve even in the midst of challenging times,"" he said during a NASA press conference on Wednesday. The July 20 date has other significance; it's when NASA astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on the moon. ""Fifty-one years ago today, NASA was deep into final preparations for the first Moon landing,"" Bridenstine said. ""Today we stand at the threshold of another monumental moment in exploration: sample collection at Mars. ""As we celebrate the heroes of Apollo 11 today, future generations may well recognize the women and men of Perseverance — not only for what they will achieve 100 million miles from home, but for what they were able to accomplish on this world on the road to launch."" New firsts on Mars Perseverance is targeted to land in Mars' Jezero Crater on February 18, 2021. The crater is 28 miles wide and the site of a lake that existed 3.5 billion years ago. Traces of a river delta can be seen in images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. And the rover may be able to find signs of ancient life in this intriguing location on Mars. ""The mission has one launch, 314 million miles of interplanetary space and seven minutes of terror to get safely onto the surface of Mars,"" said Lori Glaze, director of NASA's planetary science division, in a statement. ""When we see the landscape at Jezero Crater for the first time and we truly begin to realize the scientific bounty before us, the fun really begins."" Perseverance is the heaviest payload NASA will have ever landed on Mars, if all goes as planned, and its parachute system has gone through rigorous testing to ensure it can land the rover, which weighs 1 metric ton. This will be NASA's ninth spacecraft to visit the Martian surface, but it's the first that will collect samples to be returned to Earth by future missions. Perseverance will take core samples of rock and regolith, or broken rocks and dust, using its Sample Caching System, ""the most complex and cleanest mechanism ever sent into space,"" according to NASA. It was imperative that the system be clean so there's no confusion over any potential biosignatures Perseverance may find and collect. The system will stow samples in metal tubes dropped at collection sites across the crater. Later missions will retrieve these and return them to Earth in about 10 years from now, a complex endeavor that will be the result of NASA partnering with the European Space Agency. Using its suite of scientific instruments, Perseverance will also study and characterize Mars' climate and geology. Experiments on the rover will also help with preparation to eventually land humans on Mars. Perseverance is also armed with 23 cameras, most of which will be able to capture color images and even high-definition video. The cameras will be active during the rover's entry, descent and landing. ""We'll be able to watch that big parachute inflate and watch the rover deploy and touch down,"" Wallace said. ""It's the first time we have ever been able to see a spacecraft land on another planet."" The video won't be available in real time for people tuning in as NASA monitors the rover's data during entry, descent and landing. But it will be shared in the weeks after landing. ""The first priority will be data on how the rover is doing after landing, but we hope to have video back in the weeks after touchdown,"" said Andrew Good, JPL media relations specialist. ""Data will be coming back in pieces from multiple orbiters, which of course are shared by our other missions on the ground, Curiosity and InSight."" The rover is also carrying a couple of microphones, which will also be active during entry, descent and landing. The rover teams look forward to hearing the sounds of the rover's wheels on the Martian surface and the sound of wind on Mars. ""I'm excited to hear the sounds of Mars and the sounds of the rover interact with its environment,"" said Katie Stack Morgan, Perseverance deputy project scientist at JPL. She also suggested that interesting science could stem from the sounds they'll be able to hear as the rover's laser is aimed at rocks. And stowed beneath the rover during its journey to Mars is Ingenuity, which will be the first helicopter to fly on Mars or any planet in our solar system outside of Earth. The helicopter is scheduled to have three test flights during its time on Mars. It's considered a demonstration payload, meaning that NASA can learn a lot from this experience and apply that to future missions. And Perseverance will be able to image Ingenuity as it flies over Mars, capturing the historic flight on another planet. "
115,"Tenino, Washington is printing wooden money to help residents through the pandemic","As businesses struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic and a record number of Americans have lost their jobs, one small city in Washington state put forth a creative solution to help its neediest residents pull through: printing their own money, out of wood.","Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:14:23 GMT",http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/cnn_topstories/~3/g-4isabHOm4/index.html,"As businesses struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic and a record number of Americans have lost their jobs, one small city in Washington state put forth a creative solution to help its neediest residents pull through: printing their own money, out of wood. In Tenino -- a community of less than 2,000 people halfway between Seattle and Portland -- residents who can demonstrate an economic hardship caused by the pandemic can receive up to $300 a month in wooden dollars, subsidized by a City Hall grant program. The bills are made of wood veneer and are each worth $25. They can be used to purchase necessities and services from licensed or certified providers, as specified in the guidelines by Tenino's City Hall. The wooden dollars cannot be redeemed for cash -- the maximum change allowed is 99 cents -- and they can't be used to purchase alcoholic beverages, tobacco or marijuana, which is legal in Washington state. Many stores and restaurants in Tenino now accept this alternative currency, which they can exchange for US Dollars at City Hall. ""We basically treat the wood money just like cash,"" Chris Hamilton, the store manager at Tenino Market Fresh, told CNN. People have used the wooden bills to purchase groceries and home repair items at his shop. ""With so many people having financial troubles right now and not being able to work, it definitely helps,"" he added. ""The nice thing is it keeps the business in town,"" Hamilton said. ""The currency is only good in Tenino, so it helps promote the small town and keep business local. It's a two-fold win for people."" Tenino has printed $10,000 worth of wooden bills for the time being, and so far about a dozen people have qualified to participate in the program, according to Tenino's Mayor Wayne Fournier. ""I think people enjoy it and they appreciate it,"" Fournier told CNN. ""There's a direct, quantifiable economic aspect to it, but then also an intangible spirit of creating hope,"" he added. Local communities the size of Tenino's face bigger hurdles when it comes to receiving state and federal pandemic relief, according to Fournier, so the currency is the city's response to the circumstances. The Latin phrase engraved on the bills is meant to translate as ""we've got this handled,"" Fournier explained. ""That's how we feel we have to do things around here, no one is coming to help. We have to step up and do it on our own."" ""You have to pull yourself up by the bootstraps,"" Fournier said. ""If we can inspire other communities to do that, we're all going to be better off."" History revamped This is not the first time the city of Tenino has resorted to printing its own money in times of economic hardship. It happened before, during the Great Recession. The Tenino Wooden Dollar was first printed in December 1931 when the local Citizens Bank failed and all bank accounts were frozen, according to city historian Richard Edwards. At that time, the currency was backed by the local Chamber of Commerce rather than by the local government, and was the brainchild of local newspaper publisher Don Major, who thought to use his printing press for the purpose. Residents could sign over up to 25% of their bank deposits to the Chamber of Commerce in exchange for the alternative currency, which was also made of wood, an abundantly available material in the Pacific Northwest. The first Tenino wooden currency circulated from 1931 to 1933, and later became a collectors' item. The fact that the new version of the Tenino dollar is also printed on wood has to do with the fact that this city ""is very history aware,"" Edwards told CNN. The current Tenino Wooden Dollars are printed with the same newspaper press from the 1890s that was used in the 1930s with custom engraving blocks. The machine, which resides in the Tenino Depot Museum, was used over the years to produce commemorative versions of the historic Tenino Wooden Dollar for the collectors' market, for organizations and for special events, according to Edwards. A novel kind of scrip Leonard Augsburger, the project coordinator of the Newman Numismatic Portal at Washington University in St. Louis, told CNN that currency alternatives and scrip were very popular during the Depression era, especially after the 1933 Bank Holiday ordered by President Roosevelt. ""There were thousands of various scrip issues during the Depression, a lot of times coming from local municipalities, chambers of commerce, boards of education, or companies. They were all over the country and people were used to seeing them,"" Augsburger said. ""They had by and large disappeared once people had confidence in the banks and the regular money supply was back to normal."" The 2020 Tenino Wooden Dollar is ""really intriguing,"" according to Augsburger, because it's not quite the same as its Depression-era ancestor. ""This is sort of more akin to food stamps, where the government gives you certificates that are directly redeemable for food and primary needs."" While government assistance through social programs is well-established, the Tenino Wooden Dollar is a more direct way for a local government to provide direct aid to individuals while supporting local commerce, according to Augsburger. ""To see this done on a very local basis is novel."" Is it legal? The authority to print money resides with the federal government, and US Dollars are the only legal tender in the country. But is Tenino actually printing money? Jesse Kraft, an assistant curator at the American Numismatic Society, doesn't think so. ""No one is going to be held accountable for this because they are not actually creating money, as it's legally defined. These are just tokens that are creating an economic stimulus,"" Kraft told CNN. ""It begs the question: what is money? It really is just something that someone is willing to spend and the other person is willing to accept,"" Kraft added. It's unlikely the federal government would worry about the Tenino currency unless it became much more widely used, according to Augsburger. ""I don't think that it would be prosecuted unless it really ramped up to a very, very large scale,"" he said. ""We know we are pushing the envelope,"" Tenino Mayor Fournier told CNN. Fournier quoted Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis' interpretation of the freedom of states to ""serve as a laboratory; and try novel social economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country,"" and the Tenth Amendment, which limits the federal government's powers to those expressly granted by the Constitution. Based on these tenets, Fournier told CNN Tenino's micro currency experiment is ""as American as apple pie."" Creativity beyond borders As American as it is, the Tenino experiment is receiving attention not just from other states around the country, but from all over the world, the mayor said. He has fielded media inquiries from Canada, New Zealand and Norway in recent days. ""The global interest in this story is amazing and I sincerely hope it inspires other communities to try bold new ideas,"" Fournier told CNN. The attention has also brought about donations from benefactors both foreign and domestic, according to Fournier. ""The generosity has been amazing."" Others are getting in touch to purchase Tenino Wooden Dollars as collectibles. ""We're getting bombarded with requests from out of the city folks that want to purchase them, and they're offering like seven times the face value."" If Tenino residents were to resell their wooden dollars for a profit, Fournier would still feel like the currency met its stated purpose. ""I still think you've directly helped an individual that's been harmed by the pandemic."" His hope is for those profits to be reinvested in the local community. ""We preach localism like a religion,"" Fournier said. "
